Pretty mad.  Ordered heavy duty and one shock came with light duty hardware. Easily noticeable too.One was p1336 and the other p1334 hardware.  Pic attached.

The smell is pretty powerful, but it cleans well and safe on upholstery and leather. I have used it to detail car interiors and it cleans very well. Took one star off due to the strong smell.

I let the air completly out and tested it. I can still use it for tire rotations.I already ordered the (6.1-17.3 inch) kit. I have to return that one and get the 5.3-13.9 inch kit. It is not much lower, but it will be enough to fit under the car with a flat tire.The 5.3-13.9 inch kit is only availible from China and costs more. amazon.com/dp/B01DTTVLNI/

The material is good and feels soft against my skin and I like that the top folds back. The length is great and get tucked into my jacket nicely.  The only problem it has, is the seam for the top portion of the balaclava is in the center of your head. This causes it to bunch up and become irritating under your helmet.

Same height as my Memphis Shades fats windshield, which keeps the air off my helmet .I recommend the 9'  for no helmet buffeting.

Chamberlain's leather milk is amazing ! I have used it on a leather couch and the couch, while not in bad shape, was dull and in need of a good cleaning/ conditioning.I used it in a small area, just in case. I was afraid the product would do something to the blue leather. It passed the test, so I went ahead and did the whole couch in this manner:#2- THE CLEANER. I put the cleaner on the sponge and rubbed it right into the entire couch. I left it for about a half hour so it would absorb. #1- THE LINIMENT. I put this onto a pad and rubbed it into the couch. After giving it time to dry, I buffed out with a clean cloth.The couch looked great after this! It was clean and had it's shine back and looked like new. The pads that come with the set of 3 bottles work great.I did not use #3 WATER PROTECTANT on the couch since I didn't think it was necessary.I'm going to use this on my son's 2 pairs of Red Wing boots. My son is deployed and his boots that he wears when he's home are in need of attention. I'll use all 3 of the products from this set and his boots will be ready for him when he's home on leave!I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW

I was very pleasantly surprised how high quality this solar panel and all of the included accessories were. I have had a few other solar panels in the past and they don't even come close to comparing to the quality and design of this one. I put this panel in the windshield of my old truck using the included suction cups and it feels very secure. I love how slim the panel is and how the cable runs cleanly out the back. In addition, the quick connect cables are awesome and make attaching the right accessory easy.This panel is the perfect size to keep a standard automotive battery topped off. In the past I have left my truck un-driven for a few months at a time and come back to dead battery. This panel provides enough current to counteract the natural drain of a battery, which is all I really need. I will buying more for some of my other equipment and I highly recommend this solar charger.

Broke after 1 season.  Center piece broke out.  Metal is very thin inside.  Not built to last.  Look elsewhere for a durable nozzle.  The piece could've flew out and hit the vehicle I was washing.  Luckily it didn't.

Starting this Review to add photos. There was concern in the Timken bearings that they are differently branded( turns out the bearings are are koyo and it states Timken sources from different manufacturers..lame)These seals have no markings on them, I have added a photo. Never have dealt with Seals before so I can't identify them. I will update my review a few months after my install to let everyone know if there are any leaks.

UPDATE:Used for about one year now, I'm very impressed by this products ability to keep my battery warm enough to hold its charge in these brutal MN temps. HIGHLY recommended!I'll start by stating that I have a 500CCA (cold cranking amp) battery when it's recommended I use a 770CCA battery, that's way too weak for my car but all that I could afford at the time.I live in northern Minnesota (Bemidji area) and should have bought one of these long ago, keeping a car/truck battery warm during the winter will surely extend its life. I've owned it only 2 weeks but we've had everything from 30F all the way down to -25F tonight, I plugged in the battery wrap overnight and tried a test start at 0F that morning, my car ('99 Buick 3.8liter V6) started like it was a summer day, next was a -11F night & I tried that start @ -11F, it turned over in less than a second but not quite as quickly/easily as the first test.Okay, tonight was going to be the real test in my mind, we were slated to have -25F and did, I let my car (which is always parked outside) sit in that cold for 4 straight hours before giving it a try, the interior lights were bright when I opened the car door and when I turned over the engine it took about 2 seconds to start, very understandable in that brutal cold, I'm VERY impressed with Kat's product.I'm sure that we'll see some -35/40F yet this winter, the battery wrap will be plugged in to keep it warm, but I doubt I'll try a test start as firing up an engine in those extreme temps can ruin engine belts, and tough on pulleys/bearings etc. The battery blanket will help to keep a charge on my battery, I'll be using it any time the temperature drops below 25F or so.And it was EASY to install.I'd give this item a 10 Star rating if I could.......

This is a great set of microfiber wash clothes. I bought them specifically for washing my car by hand (recommended) and they have been great. They clean well and it is easy to stick them in the washing machine to clean them after you're done. They are really gentle on your auto's finish. Highly recommended.

It's worth spending a little more on a good kit like this I used it for the ball joints on my 02 explorer worked great even tho it's make in Taiwan it seems to have decent steel and feels heavy duty and I had good luck with it but I am just a weekend warrior so I can't say how this would last for everyday use but it does have a lifetime warranty I would recomend the kit

The push bar I ordered took about 2 weeks to arrive, but it was well worth the wait. I pulled the ends apart to make it long enough to fit the screen door on our house, 30" wide. There are no directions supplied, but it's really obvious how to do the installation. The bar comes with 4 self-tapping philips head screws.I tried putting the screws in by hand, but the aluminum was too hard to start without a guide hole. I used a 1/8" bit to drill one guide hole on the top right and got that screwed in. I then leveled it off, drilled the top left and got that screw in. Total installation time, less than 5 minutes.It's robust and the white color matches our screen door. I'm happy that I don't feel we're going to push the screen in each time we use the door.

First off the packaging was really first rate, they came boxed with thick formed foam packing and also each light was individually shrink wrapped. This on top the fantastic Amazon packaging. Secondly upon dissembling one I was quite surprised to find very good construction, the housing is thick aluminum, the gaskets were made of silicone both on the lens and the wire entry. Most impressive is the construction of the circuit board. The quality of soldering under a jewelers glass showed no bad joints. The circuitry itself shows a full switching driver section with a healthy sized inductor and driver transistor, the board itself is heat sinked to the aluminum housing for good heat dissipation, in fact the case reached 157F with a room temp of 74F. this after running full time for 4 days nonstop on a regulated power supply at 13.8v.As you can see in my photos this light is very bright with each one drawing 15 watts. As to being weather proof, I would say that they would be fine for a motorcycle or ATV, but for my use I will be mounting them under a truck bumper as driving lights. And here is my one critique. The wire sealing gasket does not compress around the wire tight enough and being in such a wet environment, under a 4X4 truck I fear water will leak in. My fix for this was simple though, as you see in one of my photos of the wire seal the washer is what I added to compress the seal more which worked like a charm. I contacted Lemonbest about this and they said they would inform their supplier about this issue, but at most this is a very minor problem that cost 14 cents to fix. In all I would say these fog lights or shall I call them driving lights are of excellent value for the price.. And one last thing, it has been mentioned about the 3 lighting modes.This really is no problem as long as you do not flip the switch rapidlyPlus the lights default to full bright when first turned on. This product was supplied at a reduced cost for this review, in no case has that influenced my review of This product.P.S  I will be updating this review once the lights are installed.

Just put this on today. It's well built and pretty easy to install. Took me about an hour, working alone. It was hot out and I let it sit in the sun which helped pliability.Would be 5 stars if it sat right up against the cab (there's about a 5 inch gap), if it were completely waterproof (it clearly won't be, but they never said it was), and if it came with a better 3rd brake light (included one is really cheap and cheesy looking).Great option if you want a cap sometimes but also want to be able to use the bed for large items without needing 2 people to remove a fiberglass cap.

Bright, good quality and affordable!I almost gave it only 3 stars, because I ordered 2 pairs and received 2 different variations (one pair is amber and the other is closer to yellow) within the same order.  In addition to the color variance, they are actually different builds - one having more copper than the other (see picture).  After some thought, I ended up giving it 5 stars anyway, because the product is excellent.  Nonetheless, I will deduct stars from the vendor rating for their oversight and/or lack of product consistency.My main gripe is I installed a mismatched pair - only to discover it AFTER the installation.  I had to peel it off and compromise the adhesive backing (partial damage).One picture shows the copper conduit variance.  This is very minor, but still obviously different.The other picture is the significant issue.  it's hard to tell by the picture, but one is darker amber and the other is lighter (almost yellow) amber.  It's obvious in person, but you can tell the difference in the picture by the different shade of light emitting from the top vs. the bottom strip.Just test the lights before you install to prevent the same issue I had.

Overall the OBD reader worked quite well. I was able to retrieve my engine code just fine and it gives you the option of clearing it if you want to. The OBD reader also has a few other functions that it can do for real time outputs. This includes having a GPS location or a real time RPM display. The other thing that was fun, was the function of making your phone turn into a heads up display (HUD). The phone reflects of the inside of your windscreen and you can see a real time display of your RPM and speed. The problem is that you cant see the speed in anything other than Km/hr, which means nothing to me. There is also a few other features that didn't seem to work but for all the basic functions it all worked as expected.I have included the displays you will see in the app. You can change the types of display you want to see on each page and whether it is a dial or digital display. It can give other engine data too. The app works very well with everything else and I did like everything. I received this product for a discount in exchange for an unbias review.

I have the full set on my 2016 F-150 Super Crew XLT (Sport Package).  Be sure to use WeatherTech's fitment selection for these.  They'll ask you if your truck has the OE flares or not, and whether or not you have running boards setback 2" or more or not at all.I have running boards (setback >2") and these fit without issue.  The ONLY problem and reason I gave them three stars is because their hardware screws aren't stainless.  They've been on the truck since November 2016 and the screw head and threads are completely rusted.  The cam locks are also mild steel and rust as well.  So expect rust streaks in the future on them.  For a company hellbent on protecting your vehicle and the prices they charge, you'd think they'd use stainless parts.

Original Review: September 16, 2016 - These tires are absolutely awesome for my big bore LTZ400. The price is excellent, and these tires are every bit as good as the name brand holeshots. I've put about 50 very hard miles on them so far on nearly all dirt, and just now the little rubber nibs finally wore off. In short - they seem to be wearing very slowly, which means they should last a long time!In the dirt and hard pack they grab exceptionally well, and even in loose dirt I can raise the front end up no problem (usually without meaning to) and take off like a rocket. The tires also ride pretty smooth and don't give me any high speed wobbles or imbalances.UPDATE 4/3/2018 - These tires are still killing it! We just rode 212 miles over three days through the hatfield mccoy trails of WV and barely any wear still. These tires have to have well over a thousand miles on them by now and barely any wear. We did quite a bit or highway driving with them too, since they ATVs are 'allowed' on highways down there and I was worried about the tire disintegrating,,, but somehow even one pavement they barely wore down. We were taking turns pretty good too. I'm shocked. They held up better than any other tires on the group I was riding with.

I have a 95 Polaris Scrambler 400, I called everwhere including the company that sold this to me on Amazon, they all said that this would not fit my quad, my friend has a 99 Scrambler 400 so I match my old one to his newer updated one, it was the exact same size, so I bought it, and it fit perfect. Solved the problem of my 21 year old warped cover that was rubbing on my clutch, Fix my toys was the seller, they actually told me this would not fit, but it did,it showed up on my door step a day early. All in all Im happy.

I installed a Gibson catback on my 1995 V8 Dakota with a Magnaflow high flow catalytic converter, and the combination was just too loud at cruising speeds around town.  I didn't want to draw the attention of local law enforcement, especially with how ridiculous Washington state law is on the matter, so I bought this.I removed the 90 degree side-exit pipe of the Gibson catback and ran the exhaust straight out the back with a downturned tip.  This muffler took all of the resonance out of the exhaust note and quieted it down a lot... now you hardly hear the raspier tones of the exhaust unless you really get on it.  At cruise on the freeway it's quieter than stock I think.  At idle the overwhelming character of the exhaust note is a deep thrumming noise and not much else.Just be careful when buying, the descriptions on Amazon are deceiving; I purchased the wrong size initially due to this.  Cross-reference the part number on Magnaflow's website to get the exact dimensions of each muffler.Update 4/4/13 - I've posted a picture of what the muffler looks like after being on the truck a few months and going through winter.  I'm not impressed with the quality of the stainless, it shouldn't have a patina of rust on it after being on the truck less than 6 months, even if being driven in the winter.  I don't live in an area where they use salt on the roads either.  If you live in the rust belt you may want to find a muffler constructed with better quality stainless steel.

I used it for leather car seats. As you can see from the photos, this product works, but it could be better. I explain later on.  The main part of success here is color matching, which was not helped by this product. All you need are colors, and mix them to match. Read online many different opinions on how to do it. Then, wait until it dries, and check in direct light, sunlight is the best. If it looks very close in direct light, you probably won't notice a difference while in the car.A tip with this product is not to cover more of an area than needed with the repair compound . This was my mistake as I covered a larger than needed area, thinking I could sand(800&1500 grit wet/dry paper) to blend in better with the surroundings. This was a mistake as the product is not made to sand as it is a latex material. Other leather putty is sand-able and this is what the pros would use. You could just purchase from the putty alone, if that's a really good product then the results will be better, and faster than this.LeatherNu repair compound takes time to fully dry between layering coats. I used the whole bottle for this one area(seat bolster) where the product advertises it is good for a whole couch or two seats given my size repair. If you want it to look good, use many coats(I used 5) attempting to sand in between. this is typical in these kinds of repair. I couldn't see where a whole 2oz bottle of this repair compound could fix more than a 1x1 sq/ft area.A part from the leather putty and color dyes/paint(think it's and acrylic/water base blend you can get anywhere) this kit is unique in that it provides several types of texture paper to make the final layer look similar to the rest of the area. It works to help your eye not focus on the flat spot where you repair is. And I give this kit 4 starts for this, where without it, this would be a three star repair kit.That said, I would recommend this product to first timer leather repair people. It would work great for couches, shoes, bags, but leather car seats are hard. You can do it, but it taaakkkees ttttttiiimme. Three days total for me.Next time, and for car seats only, I would purchase a reputable leather repair putty by itself. A sand-able one, that is ply-able until dry in case you make mistakes. Get only the colors I need to match. And this would work better in my opinion.Back to why LeatherNU is useful and different from the others -  the textured finishing paper. This is why I recommend this for beginners, they can focus only on the exact area if of the repair, not blending it as a other styles of repair. Then, build up the repair compound drying in between until the repair surface  sits higher than the surrounding surface, then sand it down(sand paper not included) to match the surrounding level with 1500grit sand paper, clean it(water/vinegar mix), add a thin layer of compound to finish "blotting" with the textured paper to get a look(wont see the accuracy yet). Repeat this step, drying or semi drying in between. You want to build the texture here. With the final layer, after you can see "some" textured layering, let it dry fully, then apply to the color in two or three sets, drying in between of course, where the last coloring is finished with "blotting" of the textured paper again, but this time it's with the wet paint, repeat until it matches the original area. Done.I did use the finish clear coat and after it looked worse, I'm. But only in that the clear coat added a gloss to the final look(other products have a kit where there are two clear coats, a gloss and a matte, so you could mix them to get a closer protective finishing coat).Only use the clear coat if you expect to this repair surface to come into contact with a lot of friction. Otherwise, it'll throw off, slightly, your final look.

Update:Well, I thought the build quality was great. Unfortunately they failed to seal these effectively and they have leaked. They are used on a vehicle as I assume most people would do. They have never been dinged, bumped, or scratched. They just couldn't handle being exposed to the weather. I'll follow up after I contact the seller/manufacturer.Original Review:So much better than the extruded aluminum designs like http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V2VF5GU I expect these to last so much longer than those other which leaks after 4 months. I put these on my motorcycle and will be ordering more for my Jeep.

I am posting the same review also for the FIAMM 72112.Easy to install.  Sounds great with its partner, the FIAMM 72112 (low note).  I cut off the connector of the stock horn, made a y-harness out of 12-gauge wire, and soldered the +/- to the tabs.  Very easy, took about an hour total.  Works fine so far.  They are louder than the stock horn.  They aren't ear-splitting loud but they will definitely get someone's attention.  Recommended as everyone is so distracted lately with their noses buried in their smartphones, you need to get their attention to quit drifting in your lane!

This year after trying to use a power seeder to over seed my yard. I found that trying to do the hilly areas where virtually impossible. I was doing more damage than good and killing myself trying to get it up the hills. I bought an Aerator, a Dethacher and a Yard Sweeper. Using each one allowed me to rough the surface enough to allow the grass seed to reach soil level to germinate. I only used the Aerator without any weight to help scuff the surface without pulling plugs. Of course I had to use a broadcast spreader to do the seeds, but this was WAY EASIER!  OK to the part I want to share with others. I found that at HF they sell a roll of Anti-Fatigue Mat for just under $10.00 add the 20% coupon that they have and it is even less. I used the box it came in to cut out a pattern, (but any brown paper or something else would work.) to make a covering for the top to keep it from being scratched up and rusting from adding concrete blocks added for weight. The pattern will only make it easier to match all the slots in the top for the handle to come through. Make it snug enough so it will stay in place when no weight is apply and you will not have to worry about rust later on. (looks nice too) :) attached is a photo of it and also the dethacher I also had enough to cover as well.

Received my tail light covers and got them installed.Really like the quality of them, heavy duty metal, coated extremely well, matches very good in texture to my bumpers and fenders.Install was a breeze, there are two different size screws, so pay attention when you remove your old screws.Over all impression...Very impressed, already had comments from Jeep club members on how great the look and wanting to know where I got them from.

I received this even before it said I was supposed to, which was pretty awesome. For a cheaper light bar, I can't even complain. It doesn't leak water into it, it's super bright and was simple to install. Every one asks where I got mine and I refer them to Topcarlight - why pay $500+ for a name-brand light bar? This one works perfect. Make sure you get some good aftermarket brackets, I wouldn't trust the small ones that come with it though.

Sample provided for evaluation.I was so pleased when I opened the package containing the Ice King ice scraper, just in time for another Midwestern winter.It comes in it's own zippered bag with a small microfiber cloth for wiping fog from your windshield, mirror, etc. I like that I can keep everything together in the bag so it's easy to find on those frosty mornings.The scraper is smaller than others I have but is really sharp so it peeled the frost off my windshield like a vegetable peeler! The handle is ergonomic and comfortable. I think this would be better for people with smaller hands. It looks and feels like a good quality scraper that will last, I will certainly update this review if that changes after use.

Bought 5.  Price is right for aluminum and they look great.  Balanced out quick.  I dig the weight savings and the appearance. Center caps included!  (4.5 x 5 wheel pattern.  2007 and up Wrangler folks need 5 x 5 so look for that size instead)Tires?  Looks are subjective.  Some people value winter stuff over rock performance or mud.  Check a few reviews and go with your wallet and what you like.  I have BFG KOs (32x11.50s and a 3 inch lift)  The KOs last a while and look good.  Coopers rock.  Nittos are sexy.  Happy hunting!

I purchased the set of 2 filters after having taken my 2009 ML350 to the dealer for the B service. They recommended that I replace the air filters and quoted me $150. After a search on YouTube, I decided to replace the filters myself. The job took around 20 minutes to complete and the only tool you will need is a T25 torx bit. As you can see in my photos, the Mann-Filter C 3968 is identical to the filters I replaced. Both sets are made in Germany, both have the same part number, the only thing missing is the "Mercedes-Benz" printed on the side of the filter.I will definitely be replacing the air filters myself and probably more frequently in the future.

These are the Z-71 replacement springs for a 00-06 Tahoe/Yukon. Paired with 2" coil spacers and Extended Bilstein shocks gave me a 3" total lift in the rear from a stock (non-Z-71) Tahoe.  Looks great.Did need coil compressors to fit them in with the spacers, FYI.

These locks seem more substantial than the plastic locks on my old trailer.  I would give them 5 stars except:1) no template or directions for mounting them in a door.  This may be ok for those of you who are replacing an existing lock, but I put these into a cargo trailer and without directions or a template the process took much longer (trial and error) than necessary.2) the screws to hold the lock together are too short - maybe 2 turns before they tighten.3) the key is really cheap and I would not say the lock is not very secure.  The only comfort on this score is that the deadbolt is so hard to turn that someone trying to pick the lock would have trouble turning it.4) the deadbolt is very hard to deploy - I loosened things to check to see if it was binding and it was not binding, just tight.Other than that, I am very happy to have this type of lock on my cargo trailer so I can use it as a camper from time to time.

Ordered this for an off road trip over the holidays.This receiver was great. I didn't have to worry once about anything happening when I had to pull a buddy out from some mud. My only issue I had with it, was the shackle was too snug. I had to use a mallet to knock it off to attach the strap. I am going to look into finding another shackle to fit this, and use the one that it came with as a backup.

I really liked having my reverse lights being so bright. But since one of the previous ones was failing after only a year, I decided to try a different brand. I was fully expecting these to be similar. But I was not expecting them to be brighter. Well they are much brighter than the previous set. I am very impressed. When you are backing up at night in a parking lot, everyone around your car will see these lights. They also illuminate better for my back-up camera. So I can see better as well. Much safer. Super easy to install as well. I highly recommend these lights!!!!

Even though the description says 7 inches, it's inaccurate. The instillation bolt is 3 and 3/4 inch and once you install the tow hook, that's over 7 inches. Either way, it didn't fit my 2017 Outback.

Some of my bolts appeared to have been failry loose while others were tight. Go over each bolt and give them a small turn to make sure they are tight and "plink".Other than that light appears to be very bright and goes a bit further than the stock high beams on the truck. Will update this review in some months after the lights will have seen some travel and rough winter conditions.These were mounted on a Westin Bull Bar which has the 18" mounting holes. Sadly the Lightbar doesn't adjust past 17.5" but the licence plate bracket holder worked perfectly.

This product was very easy to install.  Just follow the instructions provided in the package.  I used the tools listed, and the installation went like a breeze.The shock greatly slows down the tailgate to lessen the stress on the cables, and does not make it any harder to close the tailgate.This is something that should have been standard equipment on the truck to begin with.

These do not fit right on a 2016 Tundra, cheap and have huge gaps, tape does not hold says 3m but I question that looks like reprint knock off tape. Seller wanted pictures before I could return them. Video would have been better. Plus they scrapped the back side of the chrome plastic off because they know they do not fit right prior to selling them on Amazon. FYI these fly off and hit another car what than?

Nice pump for the money. Pump ran smooth, quiet and did it's job. You will see some complaints about oil residue on the pump, they are tested at the factory and drained but some remains in the pump. Mine had very little around the fill port and brass fitting both caps was loose. I would find this to be normal as the box is tossed around in shipping,  just wipe it off fill it up with supplied oil and get the job done....  Now for the performance, I live in Hawaii and my home is about 10 feet above sea level I could pull 28.0"- 28.5 +" hg. I ran the pump for  one hour,  29.921" Hg is (absolute vacuum)  so this pump is not that far off from absolute. Keep in mind atmospheric pressure and altitude affects vacuum pump performance. This link should help you understand the relationship for the above. http://www.anver.com/document/vacuum%20lifters/atmospheric%20pressure.ht http://www.dekkervacuum.com/pdfs/uploads/s2p040-alt.pdf

This is an awesome light bar. You're not going to find a better one for the price. It has all aluminum construction, adjustable mounting attachment points and is bright as heck. It does not look like some cheap light you would buy. It looks on par with any light that you would spend a couple hundred dollars on. If you're looking for something to light up the trails, this is the one to go with.

If you have hard water stains on your windows and have tried almost everything to get it off and haven't tried this stuff, do it. I would NOT recommend using wool of any kind as it will leave some small scratches on your windows as it did mines. Luckily I tried on a small part of the window so no biggie. I would recommend either using a buffer but some hard scrubbing will do the job. I was even able to move some hard water stains on the chrome trimmings with this stuff!Make sure you clean your windows before hand so you aren't moving dirt and dust around.

Buyers be ware, ordered from PowerStation777, and I received a light bar with NON CREE LED chips in it. (I contacted CREE directly and they confirmed this) CREE chips are square, these ones I received were a round bulb type LED. They called it a Lumiled LED. I ordered the same set from Topcarlight a month ago, and those were the correct CREE LED chips, I am returning these and reordering from Topcarlight today

So, I am not the most mechanical person in the world, but it only took me about an hour to get this thing on.  Now, had I not had some minor issues, it would have been much quicker.  The only issue that I had was once I had removed the old bumper and was sliding the new one one, I was having problems getting all 4 holes on the top to align simultaneously, it seemed as though the bumper was catching on something, but upon investigation, I couldn't find anywhere that was hanging up.  So, I got the right side lined up with the holes, hand tightened both bolts just a bit and then shoved the other side on and PRESTO, it was on.  It looks sweet too.  The only thing I need to figure out now is how to mount my factory TJ fog lights, as there are not pre-drilled holes for the bracket to sit on.

Oem replacement works perfectly. Had an engine code P0128 show up which indicates the thermostat didn't close when it was suppose to and the engine temp was too cool. Needle usually runs just left of center around 11:00. Coolant temp usually reads between 190 and 200F which is normal. Not sure what happened that one morning. Might have been a fluke. Didn't want to chance it so I just replaced it. Super easy job. Just need a flat blade screwdriver and a 10mm socket. This part fits any 3.6L pentastar engine, 2011 to 2015 I believe. Remove the decorative engine heat shield by just pulling it off by pulling straight up. It just pops off. Loosen the two hose clamps on the air intake one near the air box/filter and the other at the intake manifold. Remove and set aside. I used a small trash can (or bucket) to collect coolant because when you remove the thermostat it's going to leak about a quart or more. Loosen the hose clamp on the radiator hose going to the thermostat and wiggle it loose allowing the coolant to run into your bucket. Use the 10mm socket to remove the two bolts on the thermostat. This is where it really poured out. Don't let it get everywhere. Reassembly is just the reverse. Not sure the torque on the bolts. I just did them snug enough. It's just plastic so you don't want to get crazy. I added about a quarter of new coolant back in and bled the line with the little bleeder valve on top of the thermostat. Just run the engine and Loosen this little cap until it leaks out and you should be set. I did this a couple of times just to make sure all the air was out. Everything has been running great ever since and I haven't seen the code reappear in over a month. Recommend this product for sure.

I ordered this Heated Seat cushion by Comfort Wheels because even though I have a nice newer model car it didn't come with heated seats and I really love that feature in the wintertime. After riding in my husbands truck that has them a few times last year I thought it would be something nice to have in my Nissan Murano.  This seat cushion was a nice addition.This particular cushion is for the seat only and does not extend up the back area.  I would have loved one that extended up the back area but this one was offered to me as a promo and I couldn't refuse it.It features a loop on the back and comes with a clip that will help to keep it in place.  The seat works well as soon as it's plugged in.  I plugged it into my power outlet inside my console while my car was running and it started heating immediately.  Because I have arthritis in my shoulders and the heat is a great help with that I placed my cushion behind my shoulders and opted not to fasten it down with the clip.  The material it's made of is a premium quality polyester and seems to be lined with some type of foam for comfort.The only thing I didn't like about it was that the packaging insert it came with showed the full coverage seat cusions and not this one.If heated seat cushion is what you're looking for this is a good one and I recommend it.*A sample of this product was provided to me free for testing and review.

I spent 4 days detailing my car and used this product as a final step after compounding and waxing my car. All 3 stages still did not remove the swirl mark I was hoping for on my black paint, but left a fabulous protective layer on my car. I have tried 20+ products trying to get rid of the swirl. I used buffer head drill attachments and actually forgot to go back out and wipe this product off after applying it. I was relieved the next morning when it wiped off nicely...unlike the meguiars compound which was a nightmare to get off!

This is a decent step for the price. The brackets are of good quality and strong but the tubes (steps) are of lower quality. These steps are solely steps and do not provide any side protection. I didn't like the fact that their design requires you to remove your Rubi Rails. This could have very easily been designed to work with existing rails. I was able to modify the brackets and cut the tubes to fit.

Excellent for soldering automotive wiring especially with short wires which can be difficult to work with.  Also works well for pulling wires away from a harness so that they can be soldered without damaging the other wires.  It's magnetic so there is almost always something to connect too.  The magnet is plenty strong as long as it is positioned on a flat spot.

Hate to do it, but Ive replaced my original 5 star review with this one after using these tires most of the season. These have a serious tread design flaw, even when inflation is adjusted within the recommended range. A few times I cut my lawn when the grass was dry, but the turf was still a bit moist from rain several days prior. Each time, when these tires first lost grip, they spun and tread filled with dirt while ripping up the turf. Tire tread design is supposed to eject material from between the treads on the way back around, so there is sustained traction. However, these retain the dirt in the treads so that when they rotate back around there is only a small amount of the knobbies protruding. This results in poor traction and ripping turf for a long time. This could also be dangerous, because I slid out of control down a couple slopes in my lawn. Even running the mower on my driveway wouldnt eject the dirt from the treads. My lawn now has ripped up tracks all over it.The only applications I think these might work with is slopped very dry terrain or totally flat terrain. But slopped dry terrain probably doesnt have grass growing on it and if you have a totally flat lawn youd be better off with a less aggressive turf tire.I hate to go through the expense and hassle of changing tires again, but probably will so I can work on getting new grass to grow in the many ripped up places on my lawn caused by these tires.

3 Stars: first off: I admit this helmet deserves a 5 star review, however, my visor came scratched up all over (It must have been before packaging because it had tape over it).Pros:-Very comfortable.-Quick strap works wonders.-The vents work great.-Feels like a more expensive helmet quality wise, minus the sun visor screen switch.Cons:-My visor came scratched up.-I received the wrong color and size, however the one I received fits much better and matches my bike.

This is the absolute cheapest an fitting I have ever tried to install. The fitting snapped while trying to make up the hose. Please do not waste your money on this type of fitting.  I don't know where they found this aluminum but it is garbage. There is a reason why this is cheaper than all other comparable fittings.

I detail for a living and. Polished a car last night for the  first time with this product.  I'm impressed no doubt. For an AIO product it does the job very well.  Little does go a long way.  Easy to wipe off although after about 35 minutes it does start to dry up.  No problem it was still easy to wipe off.  I have my go to product which is 3x this price and that one I can leave overnight if too tired to wipe off and still comes off like butter.  I have no complaint at all.  This is an excellent polish and saved me time from putting on a wax or sealant. IMO a sealant or way is always needed because I'm sure the sealant properties can't be that good with an all in one. Again I'm very happy with the performance.  This is a car I clayed and polished last night for a customer.....no words to describe her JOY!!!  P.s. it's in the technique of polishing more then the product.  No product can compensate for inexperience ..

I used a regular socket wrench for the entire install and it took about an hour.  One of the bolts was in a hard spot, and that took the majority of the time, but a $20 breaker bar would've been hugely helpful. Directions were awesome with color photos. My kids say they're much more comfy back there now.  I attached an after picture.

I have a question if I have the unit connected correctly.  I've used it for my spoiler deck brake/tail light and I have the the module in connected to the pwr source and the module out to the light itself.  It is installed in between the positive line from the bike to the light.  The XP flasher allows power through it b/c the tail/brake light works but the flasher does not strobe.  This review is subject to change if I have it connected incorrectly or I'll have to purchase a unit to work for all my brake lights.UPDATEI did attach the in side to the brake light circuit and the brake light flashes momentarily but the taillight doesn't work. I reconnected the spoiler light and the unit does not flash properly.  Going to bite the bullet & remove and replace this cheap unit.

Over all pretty good light bar, several problems I had  was the washers provided was to small for my bull bar, and my hands was to big to get in some of the tight areas so I ended up taking off the whole bull bar after the frustration I had, doing that made life a lot better!Update: moisture now getting in light!

The light arrived quickly from California, and was unblemished in the box. The end of box had split open a bit however, and some of the nuts had spilled out. No worries, I had to go and get stainless steel hardware anyway. This thing installed like a dream using the Omotor brackets shown in the photo, which I also got here on Amazon. In fact, the brackets cost as much as the light! This thing does not have Cree LEDs, because the LEDs in this light are circular, while all Cree LEDs are square. But for 80 bucks I wasn't expecting Cree LEDs, notwithstanding the title of the product. They are plenty bright, and they look just as cool as as the Rigid.The only thing I haven't tested is the waterproofing. I will come and update this review once I drive through the pouring rain at 70 miles an hour and report whether there are puddles in the light. Oh, one more thing: it doesn't whistle at high speed, which I have read is a problem with other light bars. Perhaps it's just where you mount it, not the bar itself, but this bar and my mounting brackets equals no whistle.So far, so good.

The hole for the hitch ball isn't round at the top its oval and drilled at an angle also about 3/4 down the drilled hole there is a good size ridge around the entire circumference thats going to pinch or stress the threaded portion of the ball. I wouldn't dare put a ball on it and rely on it. I'd return the thing but for  the weight vs. shipping cost  Other than that it appears well made as far as quality and thickness of metal and welds. But the knucklehead who drilled the hole knew he butchered it and why didn't quality control catch it. Its very visible and noticeable.

Great springs and even better price. Went on my 97 XJ Sport.  Raises a little bit higher then stock, I paired the Back with Dorman springs. So if your front is sagging or just feels loose, this the way to go. I did not use any spacers or anything just brand new springs all the way around

I used this on my entire vehicle and it's wheels. I removed the wheels, cleaned all of the brake dust off of them and applied two coats of Rejex to the wheels. They are super slick and brake dust now wipes off easily. I would purchase this product again.

I'm very happy with these wheel covers! It's just what I needed to update my commuter car. They came fast and were simple to install. I added a picture so everyone can get an idea of what they look like installed. Look for the pic by Tonymarti2007

Came broken from manufacturer. I went through 4 of these before I finally got one that wasn't broken. If your in a hurry to risk just by OEM. Looks and feel cheap. They say it has a lifetime warranty on though. The sensor shown in the picture is suppose to have another nipple for a rubber hose.  As you can see it's missing. This was the exact same problem the other 3 I ordered had.

I installed the front spacer on my 4Runner. I'm waiting to get my new tires to see if I need to put the back ones in. Install was pretty simple. I found a video on YouTube that showed the whole process. The included instructions were also very helpful. (First photo is before the lift, second photo is after)

Excellent Product! I installed this on my 1999 Jeep Cherokee 4.0 as I use it quite a bit to tow my small cars around.While I do not have a trans temp gauge, I can tow for hours at highway speeds and the trans is barely warm to the touch after stopping. I have noticed extremely clean looking trans fluid thousands of miles later, so I imagine this thing is doing its job, and very well.It was a bit larger than I anticipated, and ended up taking the entire front clip off my Cherokee 4.0 to install, but that was easy enough and the provided hose was plenty long to cover trans to cooler and back. (with a bit leftover in my case)All in all, very pleased and would purchase this again for any auto trans vehicle that did not come with a trans cooler, or required one larger.The core total (including connection port) measures roughly 16" wide x 13" tall.

This is an awesome bar for the rough country TJ hood mount.  I installed them on the same 40a relay as my 18w LED cubes which I installed on the window mounts.  The bar is heavy, well designed and seems to be built to last.Everything arrived quickly and well packaged.  Couldn't ask for a better sale.

this took a little longer than expected to put on mainly because i did it by myself.  the outer bolts are a little tricky and i did ream out the holes a touch to make it all come together.  one thing to watch for if the drivers side doesn't want to line up i was having interference with the bottom of the license plate holder. if you over tighten the center bolts you will deform the crossmember, i would have liked to see a plate to spread the load out and the cutout near the hitch to hold the wire harness like the stock hitch. the finish is decent and the bolts were 8.8. all fasteners are 18mm.a few notes this weighs about 80lbs, the stock bumper goes 16lb and the stock hitch is 10lb so overall you are only adding about 55lb.i wonder if they will make a similar style front bumper with OE foglight cutouts?

Good fit.  They don't come with the ball ends like in the picture,  but you don't really need them.  Just re-use the ones in the car.  Replacement requires a 10mm socket / wrench and a small flat head screw driver.  There are tons of youtube videos that show you how to do this job correctly.  For those complaining about these being backwards, aren't aware you can re-orient the direction of the hood mount in relation to the ball joint.  Take pictures of both the original struts as a reference if you're not sure.A nice touch is that they come nicely packaged and individually seal bagged.  They even come pre-dabbed with a little silicon grease in the ball sockets.Great value compared to the $100.00 the honda dealership wants to charge for this part.

Very happy with the purchase. Super easy install. Was packaged to withstand a nuclear blast. Included the 6 new bolts that were shorter and required to work with the bumper. I mounted an 8k lb winch on it along with 2 cube LED lights on the light tabs and the thing looks baller. Also note, there is no need to cut the plastic cover with the word Jeep written on it like some of the other reviews have suggested. There is no cutting or modifying of anything required as about half a centimeter of the plastic cover should be slid under the bumper before tightening the bumper down.

This is my second time doing the LED swap on a jeep grand cherokee. I traded my previous one and didn't bother removing the bulbs. It was for the best since this vehicle requires two different bulbs and I wasn't happy with the color temperature match from another manufacturer. Anyhow, I paired this bulb with JDM Astars 921 bulb having a similar build design and I'm very happy. The color match is perfect and these are very bright. OEM bulbs are very dingy and yellow looking. I have just installed these so we will see how they do longevity wise.Not new to JDM products and as usual, quality out of the bag seems very good. The fit is also perfect for the Jeep and no error codes. This jeep is '17 but anything MY '16+ doesn't seem to be too picky about the bulbs you throw in. If you plug it in and it doesn't work the first time, try flipping it around. Took the picture attached in full sun and still these really pop.

First things first, these WILL work to replace your E36 Hood Struts on your BMW, BUT!!!! They are shorter than your stock/OEM hood struts. If you want them to fit securely and feel good about your DIY replacement follow these steps:1. Watch a quick tutorial on how to safely remove the old OEM lifts.2. Keep in mind these will be a few inches shorter than the stock meaning the hood won't open quite as high, but its nothing noticeable. (In my opinion).3. I recommend using your old Metal clips on these new struts instead of the ones provided. (I've attached photos showing you the difference).  a) Reason 1 being they don't seem to be as well built.  b) Reason 2 the originals will fit into place without having to alter to modify the "tightness".4. While installing the new struts use something to prop the opposite side up of the hood up.I give this product a four star review simply because I was able to remove the old lifts and install these replacements fairly easily and under twenty minutes. (I've never attempted this project prior to today). They were basically a direct fitment, but were not quite as long as the OEM, but this isn't enough to make it a terrible product. They held the heavy metal E36 hood up and I haven't had any issues. Good product, great replacement, product is as described.*** I had to use a broom handle to support my hood with the old lifts, now it stands alone! ***

These look great on the front of the truck. Installed in about 1/2 hour. The chip guard at the bottom of the fenders will have to be removed and not reused. Uses the two bolts at the lower outer end of the wheel well and one bolt behind the chip guard which becomes visible once it is removed. Very rigid and appears it won't peel backwards as it ages like some cheaper brands. My main purpose for buying these was for protection of the running boards. With the grooves on top of the step plate of the running boards it would be a mess to clean out anything that got in there such as asphalt, gum, rock salt, whatever. Decided to protect it now since the truck is only one month old. The turn lock on this flap is rubber coated on the end that goes between the fender and the wheel well felt. Genius idea in my mind which also shows attention to protection of the body. Thumbs up to WeatherTech on that one. These are a must have. Installed on a 2016 F150 Crew Cab FX4 with less than 3" from wheel well opening to the front of the running board. You will need to know this measurement. Spend the money, it's worth it! See my review for the 120050 Rear Flaps.

Perfect for my truck. It is lots of fun to use the horn. It sounds like a real train horn. You can get a good 3-5 seconds of "real" sounds before it runs out of air. You can spend $1000's but for the price this is perfect. I went to a stereo shop and they installed it under the bed of the truck. I highly recommend if you want an air horn.

Pennzoil Pure Base is the best passenger car motor oil available. I only wonder why in the world doesn't Pennzoil claim the ACEA A5 spec, which is "self-reported", meaning it's not a pay-to-play label like European car mfgs whose royalty is $500k for 3 years. People know ACEA A3 from Euro cars speced for VW 502 etc et al, but A5 spec is just as "good", only thinner. Well, unless you are driving on the Autobahn or Nurburgring, you are unlikely to overheat your oil and need the extra visc of a 40 weight. More likely you are cold starting it in the Midwest and driving 2 miles short trip to pick up kids, smokes and lottery tickets....not even reaching full operating temp! I admit I use 5w-30 in my Audi turbo in winter, it's thinner than 0w-40 in cold and simply works better. 5w-40 is insanely thick in cold, so good luck with that unless you want to think about it....back before auto mfg were required to spec only a single grade of oil for mpg regulations...

Ive used this wax several times before. For me works great because it leaves no residue.Some pointers I would like to give.Dont apply too much otherwise its gonna be difficult to remove and polish. A thin even application should leave a nice smooth coat.When you get to areas where there are gaps, such as door handles and pieces of trim, just use the pad with the wax left. Thats enough to cover it and won't leave wax trapped in the gaps.

I purchased this because not all of our groceries would fit on the lone hook that came installed from the Volkswagen factory. The installation was easy as all necessary parts were included and mounted perfectly in my wife's 2006 Passat B6 as there were holes lined up in the trunk to mount another hook. While it is not exactly the same quality as OEM, it is pretty close. The spring isn't quite as fluid but I mean hell it works every bit the same! Overall I am very impressed for the price that I paid!

This was bought along with oil pressure and transmission temp gauges and has yet to give any problems after 8 months. Very useful for determining how hard an engine is working and serves as a good indicator whether the engine is fully warmed up or not. The other features such as the dimming and color choices make this gauge a very good bargain.

I had to do some cutting on it to fit my needs but works perfectly. It helps that I have the right tools or I couldn't have got it to work. Looks flimsy at first but surprisingly very sturdy once installed. I weigh 220 and it does not flex at all. It's nice that it comes in different heights and widths. I would definitely buy again.

I absolutely love the lights. The only drawback I had for these was the instructions weren't very clear. They were adequate but did leave some room for uncertainty where you might pause and double check. I assembled everything before I began cutting and drilling to double check. The main thing was the pictures included were taken from several feet away and were done in black and white. It honestly wasn't difficult but could have been easier. All said and done from start to finish took around 2.5 hours. My truck is equipped with the upfitter switches so that saved some time from running wires. I soldered in behind the fuse box to hook up to their harness and then one solder under the dash to connect the pass through wire to the upfitter switch. I left the rough country wiring harness intact and simply unplugged their switches and cut the blue wire and soldered to that. I recommend adding a piece of wire to the upfitter pass through wire behind the fuse box. It was much easier to hold those three wires together and solder out in the open than hold all three and solder behind the fuse box. This also gives a little more length to hide the wires and zip tie them up neatly under the hood.If you are wiring to the upfitter switches you have a couple of ways to do it. I wanted both lights on one switch so I left their relays on and just use my switch to activate their relays. These lights draw about 25 amps and the max constant load on the 25 amp ufitter switch is recommended to be 22 amps. If you are wiring them separate you could remove their relays and all and wire it to two switches and just use your upfitter relays. This would be more work and occupy two switches but would cut out some wiring under the hood.Other than the lack luster instructions the only drawback I saw with these is that since they used the same kit twice is that one wire comes out each side of the grill. The wiring harness comes out of the end of the light and one light has to be mounted to the left and one to the right. Having a diesel I simply hooked one up to each battery and jumped their blue wires together and soldered that to the upfitter pass through wire. With out the secondary battery you'll have to make an unnecessary loop to backtrack to get the wires to power.These to me, also make the front end of this truck look much better. There is enough of a gap around that they shouldn't impede air flow very much for your radiators. These look great and provide a lot of light straight ahead. Even not having the flood lights to the side it still puts enough light out to light up the ditches. I tried to take several pictures of before and after but pictures do not do justice for the amount of light. Just know that they work awesome! I live on a country road with trees on both sides and lots of steep hills. I pointed the top light a little higher so when going down hill I still have a great amount of light showing whats coming. I included some pictures but the massive amount of light was making the camera lens (iphone 6s plus so its not like it was a great digital camera) darken everything around it so it doesn't look much brighter but it really is! I also included three pictures of the truck from about 1/3 of a mile away. You can see it with low beam, high beam, and the Les light bars.

LIFT IT UP!  I installed these when I replaced the front struts on my 2006 Armada.  Keep in mind that after the install and putting in proper length sway bar end links, you WILL have collusion between the upper control arm and the coil bucket, requiring after market control arms to be installed.  There are several options out there, but if you do your research, the right ones are a bit expensive, but will give you the safest and best quality of ride that if you are this far, you've spent enough time/money :).This product however - great and I recommend it for a decent low cost lift to your Titan or Armada

Waste of money. Purchased in 2013 and rarely used, but very undependable when I did. Extremely high fluctuation in the display. Numbers float up and down and then run away like a timer counting time. Impossible to clear and zero the display, as there's always a number present even after clearing. Going to try to get Elenco to repair this, but that's an extra cost now too that wouldn't have been necessary with a good meter.  Very disappointed!

I ordered 4 wheel bearings for my Polaris Sportsman.  One bearing came with the seal popped out of the side so I had to return it and reorder.  Another bearing, when installing it on the spindle, the inner bearing race pulled out and stuck on the hub.  You could see the inside of the ball bearings and grease exposed on the bearing.  I was able to snap the inner race back into place, but it was so loose I did not trust the bearing and went to Polaris to purchase an OEM bearing.  The Polaris bearing was so much better in quality, fit and workmanship.  It would be worth spending the extra money to get OEM over these bearings.

Nice easy little kit. My 2009 Tahoe is a 2wd. Had no problems installing. I haven't had my front end realigned yet, but it rides and drives perfect. The kit raised my truck a little higher in front than the back but that's ok. My truck has the auto ride which i was told would be affected by the lift, but it wasn't. Just in case anyone else is wondering that. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to easily and affordably raise your truck.

tried these out on a motorcycle, paired against a 3 watt single led model. in the driveway, in pics they look similar. out on the road @ a distance the 6 led 18W unit is the clear winner, much better visibility.the color difference from the stock headlight is significant, much whiter/less yellow. they are however, much larger & wouldn't look as nice on a smaller bike. I plan to use these on a larger,sport-touring bike when it's ready to ride.

Absolutely Amazing! I installed these on an old pick up bed trailer I built 40 years ago with my Dad. My son and I use it for all kinds of different jobs and sometimes have to back into dark areas at night. I had the old sealed beam tractor work lights that had been on there since 1975 that just did not provide enough light and were starting to have corrosion issues I think I paid about $12 a piece for them in 1975 and these new LED lights are way brighter and draw less wattage then the old seal beams plus the arrived very fast...Going to buy 4 more for our car trailer!

These 1700 lumen bulbs in various socket types are the brightest LED car bulbs that I've found so far.I found a fix for a design glitch.  The round socket Luyed LEDs sometimes don't fit in the car sockets.  This is because the metal lip is slightly too large to push it into the socket far enough while rotating it to seat into the retaining grooves.  If you run into this issue and really want to make it work, you can grind down the metal lip with a dremel tool, as shown in this photo.

prep your bar when you get it. And you won't get condensation in it. The reason it happens is the gaskets are stretched in the housing. (Bad idea). If you can get new gaskets, then good. I just RTVd mine by taking the frame off. Don't take the ends off, or the gasket will pull to its original state and be a pain to pull back to the end.After hooking it up, the end section doesn't work. BUT MY JEEP IS NOT RUNNING. When jumped straight to the battery, then all is well. Assuming it's low voltage from the resistance throught the harness. Should work great when I get my jeep running.

The CF140 for the Buick Lucerne is so simple to install. First open the hood. Remove the black plastic cover panel from the passengerside cowl just under the windshield wiper by pushing in on the two tabs sticking up. Pull out the plastc push pin retainer on the right side of the air filter frame(see photo's). Depress a tab on the left side of the frame and pull up and out on the filter. It may be possible to leave the push pin out. It doesn't appear that the filter is going to be moving around in the airbox.The tab on the left side was a bit hard to see in the vehicle, so the new one I just pressed the tab inward so it didn't lock into place in the cowl (see Photo). Its really not needed to hold the filter in placeWhen I first bought the Lucerne I thought the filter material was removed from its black framework, but it is not. Its all one piece.I've driven for 30 years in cars that did not have cabin air filters. I've had two cars since 2005 and haven't noticed any difference in the way I'm breathing or feel. My 2005 Park Avenue was very difficult to change so after 1 or 2 go arounds we gave up and left the filter out.Seeing the Lucerne's cabin filter is so simple to remove and replace I will continue to do so. I haven't had the car long enough to determine how many miles it takes to get dirty. After one year the filter wasn't all that dirty.

Manufacture (ACDelco) says its only for 1998 Ranger 3.0 engines but we all know the 3L hasn't been changed in ages except in 2002 where the composite intake was added. Needless to say it worked on my 2001 3L Alternator. Dont be fooled in to buying a whole regulator or alternator assembly, check your  brushes! The picture shows how mine looked after about 16 years.

Goes on very light, and it will splatter when it gets a little low. Be prepared to do many coats to get a solid color. I used it on my jeep wrangler grill, and it looks awesome. It's rubbery so hopefully it will protect the steel. I figured if I didn't like the look I could just peel it off, but I love it so I'm leaving it until it starts to get ragged. Then I'll just peel it and paint with regular paint. Would recommend.

This headlight cleaner did an incredible job on my wifes 2006 Odyssey.  They went from yellow to almost clear glass.  I even used it on my dads 2001 Corolla and got very good results.  I took pictures of dads headlights.  You will be amazed at the results.

Easy to install, I trimmed some if the install tape/backing to fit in the spot I wanted. I had no problems and it looks great.  These white stickers show up good against tinted glass.

After hearing how much the dealer wanted to replace the broken rear wiper arm on my 4-Runner I found this one at Amazon for a fraction of the price. It is described as being genuine Toyota so I took a chance. When I compare it to the original 17 year old part it was identical in every way, so I can confirm that it is a genuine replacement part. Installation is easy. Remove the rubber boot at the base of the arm, remove the nut and pull the old arm off. After 17 years mine was a little hard to remove so I put a few drops of Lock-Eze on it. Before replacing the broken arm make sure it is parked in position so it rests on the little holder attached to the hatch door. I say this because if the arm is broken it may not be lining up where it should.Its a good idea to put the wiper blade back on first (or install a new one) before fastening the arm in place to assure it lines up properly. The blade assembly is easy to remove and reinstall. I also suggest replacing the blade with a genuine OEM Toyota part because the after-market blades do not have the plastic part that guides the blade back into the holder. Yes it may cost a little more (about $18 at Amazon) but its worth it. As you can see in the attached photo the finished replacement looks as good as new.

Great safe, great installation instructions. Took about a half hour to install using hand tools. It slides very smoothly and the lock also works smooth, some have complained they wish it had a handle to open the drawer but you need the key to open it and that's the handle besides a handle can get caught on you shows or pants.The only alteration I did was the wire ties are white, I used black ones instead cause they blend in better with the black seat rail. Once I finished the install I took the Jeep out for a ride and there were no rattles of any kind.The attached pics show how well the lock box blends into the seat from my sitting position you can't see it, my side arm fits well plus there's room for my wallet and an extra one or two mags.

I have a 1996 Silverado K1500. I had enough with how long it was taking for the thermal actuator to engage my front axle so I decided to order the Dorman 600-101 actuator along with this wire harness kit. For me it was well worth the cost because it made everything so much easier when compared to trying to source all the necessary individual parts and assembling them into a harness. The kit also includes a steel spacer that is necessary for the Dorman 600-101 to work with older style trucks like mine.The harness seems like it is of good quality and was easy to install except for when it came time to splice the brown wire into my truck's wiring harness. The instructions are clear enough at telling you what to do, but I had some difficulty locating the proper wire because the instructions don't provide any pictures of what you're looking for - just several wiring diagrams. You are looking for a particular connector with a brown (BRN) wire. Yes, the wire is brown but only in an academic sense. In reality the wire simply isn't as dark as the black wire next to it.Eventually, I did locate what I thought was the proper wire. The next problem was separating it from the rest of the truck's wiring harness so I could splice into it. Using the method I've honed with many years of experience (persistence and a lot of curse words) I eventually got the wire spliced. After going through all that frustration I was even more pleased that I ordered this harness instead of making my own since I didn't have the added frustration.(Note: I took some pictures of where the BRN wire is located on my truck and posted them here on Amazon to help anybody else contemplating this project.)

So it looks awesome instead of having a big whip antenna but I think (not positive) I've lost some reception. I rarely listen to the radio I normally use pandora or my music list on my phone for my 2016 Harley street glide. I recently moved to Florida and upon being here two weeks bought the bike. I don't recall how good my reception was prior to installing the antenna due to not having the bike long prior to upgrading everything but to be honest it does work fine just some stations don't seem to come in clear but again I'm new here so I don't know if they came in clear before. I basically got this for the look first and function second.

I recently purchased a 2012 Ram 2500 4x4 Laramie, truck is a bit high for the wife so nerf bars were on the list. I went with these due to the price, looking for something to get me through until I get electrics (if I decide too). I give 3 stars due to a couple of things. First, one of the mounts (there are 6) one nut was off center from the weld thus you couldn't get the bolt in. I used a Dremel to fix. I'm sure I could have contacted the manufacture to get a replacement, but it was something I could fix and finish the install. 2nd, the 'optional' plastic clips to hold the bracket in place so it doesn't fall in to the body, oops on me, yeah I dropped one in the body. I was able to figure how to retrieve but the plastic clips would have saved me time. I blame it on using the Dremel to fix along with the upper 20's temp and cold fingers  :-) Like other reviews, wish the bottom could have hidden bolts better, but for the price, not bad. Would I buy again or recommend, yes. I'd given higher stars if not for the off center weld. I also attached before/after pictures on the driver side.

The purchase of my new ESS-100 was one of the best add ons to my 2001 dodge ram sport 1500 hands down.My truck was having aymptoms of the dreaded "death wobble", id already replaced my track bar, swaw bar bushings and end links with moderate relief, but once i installed this product, WOW! What a difference!Like driving a brand new truck.The front end is so tight and responsive now, truck no longer has that typical steering slop,  it corners like it's on rails, and is extremely noticeable!Installation was a breeze and took about 35 min start to finish. Id absolutely but this again no queations asked.Ive referred it to my friends, even took the truck by so my mechanic could see it and drive it.Even he was impressed.

I am impressed with the quality of these Bolt-On Galvanized Steel D Ring Cargo Tie-Down Anchor with Mounting Clips. I mounted them on a lightweight trailer and actually added a backing plate, for each tie down, on the back of the frame of the trailer as the frame was thinner than the brackets. they swivel loosely just like they should be when bolted tight.  The welds are great on the ring, and the ring is very smooth so if I need to thread a small strap through one of them it will not tear or fray the strap. Also the whole tie -down-anchor seems to be heavy enough to hold heavier weights than they are rated for they are very well designed.  Being a 10 pack there are plenty of them to place them around the trailer and have several tie-down points.Great product,If after reading my review of this product  If you find it interesting or useful please rate it as "helpful" or leave a comment.

It is interesting how little detailed pre-purchase information is available for these type of units (from all manufactures)  Plus, the accompanying  documentation  will not win any awards.  Hope this helps a bit.I am using the Trail Dash 2 Jeep on a 2008 Rubicon with  35 tires (17 wheels) and the stock 4.1 gears.  First impressions are that in does help with the imbalance associated with the larger tires, stock gearing and the performance of the 3.8L engine with automatic 4 speed transmission.You will need to download the Windows only Fusion application to update the device before use.  You will have to undergo a full give me all your personal information registration to get the required login to use Fusion.  I am a Mac user and Fusion performed flawlessly on a Windows 10 virtual machine via Parallels.  Unless you will be adding your own background there isn't a need for the MyStyle application.Other than configuring the TD2 for the following 3 screens and adjusting parameters for desired performance, I have not yet used the other special functions.Usually electronic devices like this can be slow and annoying to use.  TD2 interface and performance are better than like device and the display is bright and clear.The basics of the TD2 Jeep.For general monitoring and control, the TD2 is a 3 screen system comprised of screen1 screen2 and Switch screen.  This is independent of the other special functions Diagnostics, Performance testing, Data Log, Mileage Coach plus setup screens.Screen1 and Screen2 can be one of 6 possible screens.The gauges within the above screens can be one of 26 sensors (at least for the above vehicle)ABS Throttle Position4 temps, ambient, intake, coolant, transBarometric PressureBattery VoltageMPH correctedRPMFuel Level3 G-forces3 knockHP and TorqueGear and torque converter lockMPG average and instantaneous% gradeRun timeTrip odometerSpark timingThe most gauges that can be displayed at once is 12 via the Digital Gauges screenFor this vehicle there are 6 Performance levels87, 89, 91 and 93 octaneMileage XSCrawlWith each of the Performance levels, the 4 parameters can be optionally adjustedRev LimiterSpeed LimitedFansPedal Response.I used the Digital Gauge screen, the Rubicon screen and the default Switch screen.First, I set the Performance (sometimes referred to a Power) setting to 87 octane which set the Rubicon to SuperChips defaults which include shift points, shift firmness, throttle response and other parameters.First impressions are that the performance of my jeep was improved with just the Performance selection.I then  used a GPS to establish my speed and adjusted the tire size on the Switch screen to achieve agreement between the TD2 and the GPS.  Changing the tire size only effects the speedometer reading per the TD2 screen message.  The 35 tires, at 32 PSI, required a 33.5 setting to accomplish equivalent MPH readings.I then proceeded to a hilly region to evaluate the transmission shift points.  With 35 tires and the stock gears, the transmission will hunt by shifting up and down to maintain speed when going up hill.  Changing the gear parameter only effects the shift points reading per the TD2 screen message.  After numerous runs up hill I settled on 3.21 for the time being.  Note, this solution doesnt solve the down hill issue so manually selecting a lower gear is still required.My trip home is up a 6% grade.  If I leave the transmission in Drive with the Cruise on, the transmission will continually shift, hunt, up and down to maintain speed.  With the TD2, the hunting was gone and the transmission just quickly shifted to maintain speed while generally keeping the RPM above 2K.  With the Digital Gauges, I could watch the transmission and torque converter transition from 4 lock to 4 to 3 to 3 lock...For the first time I drove all the way back into town in Drive with Cruise on.  Typically I would just put the transmission in 2nd gear for the journey up the hill.The Rubicon off-raod features (sway and lockers) are electronically controlled.  Sway is available in either 4-high or 4-low but the lockers are only available in 4-low.  Off-raoding with 35 tires hasn't been an issue for me because I had to be in 4-low to lock and have sufficient engine back pressure for down bill descents without having to ride the brakes.  With the TD2, the lockers are now available in 4-high.An unlock code is required to use the TPMS settings.  The process is simple and quick.  Web request with email response.  Unlike other programmers, once unlocked, the TPMS sets the inflated warning PSI and the TPMS switch in the Rubicon screen disables the warning when off-roading at lower pressures.All the above is after just one day of using the TD2.BTW, I mounted the TD2 using the TD Dash Mount for 2007-2010 Jeeps.  Makes for a very nice install.Also, only gave it 4 stars as I haven't checked out all of its features yet...UPDATE 4/13/2017 I noticed a fair amount of knocking indicated on the display (>1 but <2) plus under extreme condition it was slightly audible.  I installed a new set of Iridium spark plugs which improved the knock reading.  This was using Power level 4, 87 octane.  Will also be running some injector cleaning additive.  Maybe up the octane level on the next gas stop.While off roading with the club, decided to try Crawl mode.  First mistake is changing Power levels, performance settings, out on the trail when with a larger group - it is a lengthy process.  Not only a series of on/off ignition cycles but the system builds new files each and every time.  This become even longer if you customize.  The only gain from switching to Crawl mode was throttle setting which could also be accomplished in the customization of the other power levels, but still the same lengthly process (no save previous builds, always from scratch).  Not worth the on-trail change.  This process would then be repeated at the end of off roading for the return trip home on the pavement.  In this case I was close enough to home to NOT reprogram but the resulting pavement performance was like stock which we all know is less than ideal in mountainous terrain.Although this device can help with the on road performance of the automatic transmission (less controlling downhill runaway), is does nothing for improved off road performance.  The transmission still shifts way to soon from 1st to 2nd, less so, but still to soon, for the other gears and still runs away on downhills.  There is no concept of holding in gear when RPMs is at idle with increasing speed.  Therefore, manual control is still required.  Not a dig deal but it would of been nice.Still glad I added this device for the significantly improved performance of the transmission on the pavement.

This is a bright light bar. I installed it on my riding mower for light in the winter when plowing the driveway. It has kind of an odd pattern but has good peripheral lighting as well as mid range spot lighting. It lights almost as well as the 50" light bar on my truck. My pic is my approximately 200' driveway with no other lighting in the area.

Bought these to replace the yellowish bulbs in my 2005 M3 and the result is great. Seem to be much brighter, maybe light does not go out as evenly as the halogen ones but I like the bright white/slight tint of blue light. In the attached picture the left side has the LED bulb and the right has the halogen 9006.

I received a set of best top mats for my 2000 TJ as a gift several months ago... And I will never use any other brand. The fitment was beyond perfect and this is by far, equal to or even better than weather tech mats. I had a rough winter, tracking in snow and salt into the jeep... And not once did any of it ever touch the underside of the mat. So when I was looking for mats for my 2013 JK... I didn't mind spending the extra money for this brand as opposed to the other ones found. Yes... You can buy cheaper ones. Yes... There are similar "style" ones... But sometimes you get what you pay for, and in this instance... It's worth it. The rear cargo liner for the 2013 JK fit perfect. Now, for those of you with the factory subwoofer in the rear.... NO PROBLEM at all. You can cut out the portion you don't need with some strong shears/scissors. All you have to do is follow the lining closest to the subwoofer. This of course allows the mat to sill trap water or whatever fluid from touching the factory carpet may. I cut out exactly along the lining... And it looks like it came from the factory that way. I'm adding a picture to show you guys the great fit.

I tried this on my Mitsubishi Lancer 12' and it's looking brand new like straight from the tire shop that shines and protects from browning up overtime. I would recommend to wash your tires first with a good wheel & tire cleaner to remove any brake dust and road grime before applying the product, and it came out great

Build very well. Made of neoprene. Pretty easy to install. It uses velcro to secure to the seats. They cover enough of the seat in the front, but i wish they covered the backs too (kid feet are always dirty). I've had them on for about a month. They seem well built, so we'll see how long they last.This is also the correct part for a 2016.

I love all my smittybilt parts and the tire carrier works perfectly, for everything. I installed it myself as with everything and it was straight forward. I put a lot of forethought into it before I installed the bottom bolt in the frame bracket ensuring it would be level. I lifted it a little with the jack and a 2x4.

Fits 04 Tahoe.  Came with required hardware.  Does leave a little more gap at the bottom.  It came as a 3 piece grill assembly.  you'll have to reuse the end part hardware clip thing.  The plastic screw assembly on the OEM grill needs to be removed since This came with its own push pin.  Also, once installed, it's very snug and secure.  Uses the same 10mm nut holding the OEM.  I also bought these since mine were very brittle.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040CYWX0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Why not a set of hellcat valve caps!  Is that chick you're trying to impress with your $70,000 super car gonna notice the little tiny cat emblems on the tire valve stems, HELL NO but you'll know they're there.  Yaaaaa, just another little styling easter egg that nobody will really notice except for people who also have them or wannabe's that wish they had a hellcat to put them on.  Narcissistic maybe, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder and it's all in the detail.  I installed these on aftermarket rims that had aftermarket tire pressure sensors and noticed that some of the threads of the valve stem were exposed.  I had some chrome trim rings from a set of spare valve stems and they covered the exposed threads and added even more style to the plain black rubber valve stem.  The original equipment valve stems are going to be metal with a shorter amount of thread and these valve caps will cover all of the thread leaving nothing exposed to the elements.  I have several different sets of wheels and I'm going to order a couple more sets of these Hellcat valve caps to jazz them up a little and make the prius drivers jealous that they don't have custom valve stem caps for their nerdmobiles.

These face masks are pretty popular and cool, I see them every time I go snowboarding. I was excited to get a set to wear them and fit in with all the cool hip kids  HA! Got them quickly, sealed and opened them upon arrival. First thing I noticed is how light-weight the material is. Holding them up, single ply the material is see through. Hardly anything there. The skull graphic is decently printed, no ink bleeds or such.  Upon putting them on, pulling over my head then up onto my face, it is clear how light they are.  Almost see through.  These will not protect against cold hardly at all.  Maybe protect a little against dust, like out four wheeling, hiking or in the sand dunes, but possibly not very well due to how thin the material is. You might just end up inhaling it all.  A regular bandana is thicker than these and may offer more filtration.fits alright as you can see in the photos I took and attached.  Stitching seems fine, no pulled threads or un even hems. Might require hand washing or on delicates cycle, likely no dryer. Hang to air dry. Washed once already before wearing and seems to have held up fine so far. The graphic is cute, well made and printed, no visible defects or peeling as with some products.  The fit is fine, although it seems to hang funny on me - again not like the picture. it's an okay as a lightweight cover, Not as heavy as I had expected.I was given the opportunity to review this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

I wanted a set of lights to be mounted under the bumper of my F250, to would be used in conjunction with rack mounted floodlights as extra reverse/work lights.  I was browsing higher priced name brand flood lights when I came upon these "utility" lights by Hella.  I've used Hella products before and always loved them, so for the price, I gave a pair of them a try, and with great results.Wiring is extremely easy, connect to power (a relay, a switch, or existing back-up lights) and they ground themselves out via the mounting bolt.  The rubber housing seems very durable, although as other reviewers have said, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to use a silicone or similar product to seal the point at which the 12V power wire meets the light, otherwise water may seep into the light itself.  A couple of small dabs at that junction and the light will be ready to go!As far as output, I was very pleasantly surprised.  55W each and the pattern is quite wide without losing intensity.  It is bright as daytime out behind my truck now.  I have posted a picture of their output in the 'customer images' section of this page.I've had them installed for a couple days now, and although time will truly tell how they hold up, for the price of ~13 dollars, they are excellent products and I highly recommend them!UPDATE:  I've run them for a couple weeks through many conditions and they are going strong as ever.  One of the brackets they were mounted to failed and left the light dangling by the power wire for a good long drive on the highway before I realized it, and it's good as new.  The lights have been caked with mud, power washed, hit, bumped, backed into bushes, frozen, thawed, and everything else in between and they are still trucking.  High recommend.

So far so good, I bought 4 of these to put on our snowmobile club's tractor groomers.  We had a lot of problems with the 55W halogen lights so we decided to give these a try.  The mounting options are nice, they're fully adjustable on the bottom of the light, also you can pivot the bracket to mount to a vertical surface.  In my case, the brackets were under the cab roof over hang and they wouldn't reach.  I ended up using hose clams to secure them to the brush cage on the cab.  The power cord is extra long making connections easy to reach about anything within reason.  These look to be well constructed, no moisture in the lens has been seen.  Our first grooming trip out will tell the real story, but our operators first response when flipping the lights on is "WOW, that's bright".

I'm a loyal Meguiars fan (and still am), and in the past I have always used their 3-step polish and wax. But I did some research and was looking for something that would take less time and give similar results.I bought this Duragloss with some skepticism but to my surprise, this stuff is the real deal. I had my Mustang completely detailed in less than an hour and the shine was incredible. Better yet, the next time I hand washed it the water rolled right off and it was MUCH easier to get crystal clean.I would and will be buying this again.

The product is made with thick steel as described and the holes mounted right up to the winch. I used this to install on my car trailer and have to agree with the previous post about the design issue for the roller fairleads. The front holes for the roller fairlead are down too far and you cannot install it without adjusting something. I had to slightly slot the holes to make the plate sit flush against my trailer vs using a spacer which doesn't spread the load when using the winch as well. The length worked out well for my use since I cut the sides to trim it down and used the excess as backing plates for the underside of the trailer.

Great product. Wish they were a brighter but they get the job done. We'll see how they do on the long run. I installed them on my 2000 Silverado on cluster, floor lights and license plate. It's a great upgrade at a great Price.

Yes, they look very cool.  Yes they are very bright.  Yes, it's awesome that the anti-flicker capability is built-in.  But I have some strange artifacts and dark spots in my beam patterns. The beams are noticeably different between the two headlights.  For this price point, I shouldn't be distracted by the beam patterns while I drive.  I sent some photos to J.W.Speaker asking what the beams are supposed to look like.  I got a very short reply:  "this may be something we would want to take a look at" and a recommendation to return them.  So they're coming out of my Jeep and going back.  I still don't know if there are manufacturing inconsistencies here.  Will a replacement set will look the same?  I shouldn't be asking these questions for $660 headlights.Update:  When removing these headlights to return them, I noticed three obvious manufacturing defects. One unit has what appears to be a 1" scratch on the INSIDE of the bottom lens (fourth photo).  The second defect is on the other unit, and appears to be a smear of grease or adhesive, also on the INSIDE of the bottom lens (fifth photo).  There also appears to black dust or shavings on top the LED component behind the top lens in one unit (couldn't get a good photo.)  There is junk inside both sealed units.  Both units are defective.  I lowered my rating to 2 Stars for JW Speaker's poor quality control and poor customer service.  It's a shame that "Made in the USA" means poor quality.

I would recommend this to anybody that needs a volt meter on a 12 vdc system and needs to view the current voltage real easy.I used mine in my RV Trailer,  I just tapped into the Thermostat +/- 12 volts and cut a small rectangle in the paneling and it popped right in and looks like it came from the factory that way. lolCons: The only problem was I thought this a seal box or mount included type meter, IT IS NOT, this is to be install into a box or panel of some sort the back is complete open with very short lead wires very small gauge wire about 22ga. (and did not have set screw like the pics posted)[url=[...]][url=[...]]

This light bar has changed night riding on the ATV. When you push the button it's like turning on the sun compared to the stock led lights on the atv. It has been through the mud and water and survived being sprayed directly with a hose for washings and I haven't had any issues. The only thing I don't like is the switch that comes with this unit. It has a little red light on the push button switch that stays on if you hook it directly to the battery. I use the atv almost daily and the longest it has set so far is around 24hrs. Battery in atv didn't seem to be affected by the red light being on constantly so it is a non-issue for me at this point and I'll keep using the switch. Thinking about buying another for my kids go kart now.

Nice fit for my Honda Recon, does not include any air filter oil with it that is the reason for the 4 star review but overall for the price and fit its worth it especially if you have your own oil.

This antenna fit my 09 benz slk 300 with one of the 4 included threaded screws.  Before installing i turned on the radio and placed it on a station that was all static (88.1) kjazz and as soon as i touched the antenna on the post the station came in clearly.  I thought maybe because my fingers were touchin it but sfter screwing it in and getting in the car it still gave me perfect reception to that radio station proving that it is a real antenna that really works.  Besides that it also looks real sharp with its carbon fiber and aluminum body.  I highly suggest to any mercedes slk owner who wants a shorter antenna than the stock one without losing the signal strength.  Def worth the wait of the 1 week shipping.  Thank you

Have 3 of these on my 1984 Honda Big Red ATC200es. 25x12.5-9 are the perfect fit! Great traction. a bit on the heavy side but an awesome tire for the east Texas trails and mud. couldn't ask for more. About to order another set for my other big red.

Got for my tw200. Ended up shortening the length a little for a preferred fit, but certainly works without any modification; for a bike with a larger tank, would be perfect as is. Holds a good amount of stuff. Recommend fitting the velcro w/ some items in it so you know proper alignment. Can remove from bike without removing the gas cap. Keep in mind on the pics, they are after I sewed it up.

Used these to replace the foot well lighting in my '16 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  They are deep blue that better matches other ambient lighting in the truck than halogens. They're even brighter. They are not a light, ice blue if that's what you're looking for. Even though these bulbs are longer than the original, they're perfect because they're easy to grab and remove. The original ones were a PIA to get out being so short.

First off I just want to say that Torklift has excellent customer service. I went to their website looking gif the part numbers to fit my truck. They didn't have any parts listed to a 2016 F-250 so I contacted them asking if they had any fit. The customer service rep. Explained to me that they didn't have anything listed because they hadn't done a test fit on a 2016 truck yet, but that the same parts for recent model years would most likely fit. He was kind enough to email me the instruction booklets so I could verify the fit. After reviewing the instruction I went ahead and ordered the tie downs and they fit great!Be prepared to do a little extra work on the front driver's side. The side fuel tank cover has to be removed to install the tie down. The bracket that goes on the bottom is a little tricky. There is a bolt going through the frame that hold the fuel tank cover in place. I had to unscrew a thin metal disc and then tap the bolt up through the hole with a mallet to get the bracket to go into place. A light tap on the frame was all it took to get the bolt to pop back through. After that it was smooth sailing and an easy install. The only other trick was when I had to trim the fuel tank cover to fit over the bottom bracket. Fortunately the cover is plastic and trimmed easily with a dremel tool and a rotary file. You could probably trim the cover with a heavy pair of shears or a hacksaw if you need to.I haven't hauled my camper with the new truck yet, but I had Torklift tie downs on my old truck, a 2005 F-150, and I don't think I would ever use a different brand. These are about as heavy duty as you can get.

I'm using this to cover our new spare tire and rim that fits under our minivan.  (Our OEM spare rim rusted really bad.) It is well made and very durable.  The elastic edge fits the cover on the wheel nicely and secure. Note: the white ring on the cover in the picture I took, is dirt from our garage floor.

The sellers of this product seriously need to work on their installation CD.Tips from my own experience:Get the drivers for the cable installed first and verify with FirmwareUpdateTool.exe before you even try to install TechStream.If Norton Anti-Virus is installed, it will silently delete some of the files you need.Installing directly on your laptop may be easier than installing on a Virtual PC if you're willing to take that chance.The version of TechStream (12) included with the cable does not allow you to modify car settings.  You may need to download an older version (10) if you need that ability.Running TechStream in Windows XP Compatibility Mode may help.There are registry entries you may need to add to get TechStream to be able to see the cable.Google: techstream xhorse registry ft86clubIf you copy/paste the registry text from the post, make sure to remove the unnecessary space character from "PassThruSu pport"

I bought the EMP Stewart 4 years ago as preventive maintenance to my 2003 BMW Z4: it has the apparent reputation of being the bee's knees, the ant's pants, and the cat's pajamas of water pumps. I paid full access price for the rodeo...It replaced a perfectly working 80K miles and 8 year old original BMW water pump which was supposed to be a ticking time bomb...Well... After 4 years and 60K miles it is leaking.I've decided to replace it with this one&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/FMI-20669-Premium-Performance-New-Water-Pump/dp/B00DJ3N3SQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">FMI 20669 Premium Performance New Water Pump</a>&nbsp;and will send it back to the manufacturer to get a replacement (since they won't issue refunds) and probably resell it.I'll update this review to let you know if the warranty is at least any good.

Nice hitch and heavy enough for all my needs. (I have a John Deere 1023E)Ordered one day and was delivered the next.It came with center link pin and 3 lynch pins.Personally I wouldn't use the spacers because it only leaves 4 or 5 threads to use so I didn't use them.The first thing I moved was a 4300 lb travel trailer and it did fine. Couldn't be happier especially for the price.

Absolutely happy. This is the best $100 I have ever spent on my jeep so far. I have installed them on 2004 wrangler tj as a replacement for stock sylvana. The difference is dramatic, the pattern for low beam and high beam is great. Installation was very easy, I did it in 30 minutes. They are made in germany, which is a nice bonus. Good quality product.

This is the second of these MICTUNING switches I have purchased and will buy more as the need arises.  This one had much better directions and a wiring diagram included that made install a breeze. The switch has a back light that lights up with the ignition on and the blue color matches the stock Polaris rzr4 1k XP back light color perfectly. One would think they were stock if you didn't know.  The size is about 1/16" larger in width and height than the perforated cut outs on the rzr dash but I would rather have to carefully file extra out of the dash hole until it fits than have the hole too big by following the perforations.

Bought this for a 2002 Toyota Tacoma.  Pretty easy install if you know what wires to use.  We just hooked up the lock/unlock function only.  Did you wire for light or horn confirm.  On my year Tacoma, both yellow wire should be wired to the black ground wire all together.  The red wire is constant power, white is lock, white/black stripe is unlock.On my  year Tacoma (2002)  the harness on the drivers side kick panel is used.  In the picture use the wires shown.  They may not be the same colors as yours but the locations is the same.My red wire constant power was spliced into my amp wire going to battery.Use these&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/AIRIC-120pcs-T-Tap-Wire-splice-Connectors-Tap-In-Crimp-Quick-Splice-Self-stripping-with-Nylon-Fully-Insulated-Male-Quick-Disconnects-Kit/dp/B06XD6QS4T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AIRIC 120pcs T-Tap Wire splice Connectors Tap In Crimp Quick Splice Self-stripping with Nylon Fully Insulated Male Quick Disconnects Kit</a>&nbsp;as they are much easier to connect.  Peel some of the factory black tape off to make it easier to get to wires.One thing on my set up.  For some reason if you lock the door using the armrest switch while the door is OPEN, it will make the fob malfunction.  To reset the fob just put the key in the door lock while door is CLOSED and lock/unlock it by turning the key.  It will reset the fob.The photo with the writing is not mine.  the other is.  Use the two bottom wires next to each other on the bottom (Lock Wire / Unlock Wire).

Bought quite a few of these!  Some red, some black. They are PERFECT for the Kobalt blue-handled wrench collection, ViseGrips, channel locks, screwdrivers. We bought one for the Komachi kitchen knives-- works just great!  Trays fit well into a drawer. Keeps tools and knives from getting banged up.  Makes it also easy to find-- they tools are all lines up neat as pins.

Received this light bar. The box showed evidence of being previously opened. The windshield mounting bars and the wiring harness were missing. There were white curtain rods in the box...WHAT...Why were curtain rods in the light bar box???? Probably would be a nice light bar if all the correct  accessories were in the box. Called YITAMOTOR and the call taker could not find my order number in their system. Will return the box along with the curtain rods.

Pros: They look fantastic - especially if you're into the "blacked-out" look.  They're easy to install and they plug right into the factory wiring harness.  Great item.Cons: No instructions.  In my opinion, products should always come with instructions.  They're super-easy to figure out - if you know what you're doing.  But not everyone does.  Also, one of them had a small piece of solder that had broken off inside.  I simply removed the plug/cap and shook the piece of solder out.  Not a big deal.  Hopefully, that doesn't mean a connection is going to come loose later on.  Time will tell.  It was so minor, though, that I didn't take off a star.Bottom line: Yes, I would buy them again.  If you don't know how to replace the marker lights in your vehicle, help is only a Google search away.

Purchased to replace links on Dodge Caravan since the boots on mine had cracked.Considered buying the factory / OEM links (Mopar OEM 4743669AC) which are actually about the same price (on-line) although those don't have the grease fittings and I don't think they come with any nuts.Additional details.the box listed "made in Taiwan".Bar diameter is 12mm = 0.472" (factory links on my Caravan were about 11mm?)Self-locking Nut is 18mm wrench sizeBolt thread 12mm (dia) - 1.75mm (thread pitch).To keep bolt from turning when you tighten nut, the bolt has hex flats on end (5/16" socket) and also flats for 17mm wrench next to boot.Comes with grease fittings (zerk) which need to be threaded into the holes.The note in the package states "Link is pre-greased. Do not add additional grease".This makes me wonder why they give you the zerk fittings, and when/if I do grease them, what type of grease to use anyway (since they always warn you about issues with different types of grease being incompatible).It would have been nice to have more instructions on the greasing aspect.See photos in customer photo gallery.Update : July 2016:I noticed that, due to the length of the mounting bolts, that the lower-left bolt rubs on the brake line mounting bracket.(as I can see scratches/grooves on it). I tried grinding it down slightly but I don't think it helped.Also, be careful to install the grease nipple all the way otherwise it rubs on the drive axle.Next time, I would have ordered OEM Mopar parts.

Awesome product! Works better than any I have ever purchased. Secondly, the company InstanNatural LLC is incredible as well. My tire shine showed up with a broken trigger on the applicator so I had to use a rag to apply. I sent them an email just to let them know and they are sending me a complimentary product which they did not have to do.

These ceramic pads fit my 9-3 Aero rear brakes perfectly. No squealing or noise and the dust is barely noticeable.  You can't beat the price either!  I would have given 5 stars but I know these aren't the absolute best quality though they work just fine for me.  I would recommend these to anyone who needs a good quality pad at a great price.

Did not receive the 341500 model as pictured.  What I received was the Lippert 432682 model (see picture below for difference).  I spent a lot of time and homework to make sure the steps I purchased (or thought I was purchasing) would fit my application.  Luckily I was able to make these work on a 2017 Cherokee Wolf Pup.  In replacing a single step with this double step, I didn't realize that I would be increasing the distance from the top step to the door as the height (depth) of the frame is larger to accommodate the two steps when folded away.  With that said, I'm not sure if I really made it any easier to get into the trailer?

Great product for the price. Did take me six hours to polish the car but that is because I took my time. I do wish the first stage was a little more aggressive but it did reduce my swirls and took out a few minor scratches. Mind you this is on nine year old paint that before me was not kept up that well.

Installed on my '17 F150 supercrew 5 1/2 foot bed. The cover is well built and feels like a quality product. Installation was fairly easy, taking about 90 minutes doing it all  myself. Since the bed on this truck is aluminum I took the precaution of isolating the rail clamps with rubber pieces cut from an old bike tire tube. Not sure if this is really necessary, but since aluminum is prone to galvanic corrosion from contact with dissimilar metal it certainly can't hurt. The cover does a good job of keeping light rain out but heavy rain and carwashes will get in, mainly around the tailgate gaps. The cover I received had a manufacturing problem causing the rear latches to not extend far enough to engage the rails (see pics). This was due to the latch release cable being too short and tight, holding the latch pins partially open. Cable length is not adjustable, it is cut to length and cinched at the factory. Tried resolving through customer support but they were initially unresponsive so I fixed it myself by cutting off the factory cable and replacing it with a longer cable. Now the latches fully extend and work as they should. Nevertheless I should not have to fix ANYTHING on an eight hundred dollar cover, it should have been properly inspected and delivered in working order.UPDATE 1/3/18: Customer support contacted me to apologize for the delay. They even sent a replacement cover as a precaution against my "fix" voiding the warranty. That's why I updated this review with an extra star.

Replaced stock leaf packs on my 2001 jeep xj with these. Gave me a couple inches of lift, and ride great. I also added some adjustable shackles. If you do this yourself, read up on the procedure and prepare for all the problems you might encounter. I had to cut one of the front bolts off as they like to seize inside the old bushings.  I was able to get one side out sucessfully after some fighting...

Amazing set of LEDs that can be seen day and or night. They're super bright and made my DIY project a breeze. They're sealed from the elements so water cannot ruin them. Heavy duty constucted with an enclosures made from steel, and can definitely withstand the elements. What else can you ask for. I'd definitely buy from them again.

Had to cut the back of the 2 Inch receiver the size of  half of a silver dollar to clear bumper of my 2014 KIA Soul exclaim. Also had to file ends of 1 1/4 to smooth the end. I used hack saw to get started then my hand saw to make the cut. As described in another review I cut an arc about 1  1/4 height to top and back  of tube.  Expect the teeth to wear down on a good metal saw blade and eventually break which is a good thing. You reinsert broken blade into saw with now new teeth. Broke two blades had a stubby left over.  Took me three hours, sitting out side.  Each cut took about three to five minutes before my blade would come loose.  I knew I would have to do this mod.. If you can't do this, I question maybe you shouldn't pull something. I have had two motor homes and pull cars and you better be prepared for the unexpected.

from 20 PSI to 37 PSI in 90 seconds! Great way to rapidly re-inflate my JK Rubicon stock tires FAST! I love the auto shut-off feature, the compressor is relatively quiet and the hose is long enough to reach all 5 tires (4+spare).My only caveat is not to place this on your bumper (place it on the ground). Upon pulling the hose the compressor fell on the filter assembly and it broke (see photo). The replacement part is only about $10 here on Amazon, but it still was a major bummer on it's second voyage...I would give this 5 stars if not for the weak filter assembly.

Remarkable difference before and after cleaning with this solution. We used it on a 99 Miata with a tan top.  Pics attached.  It was so dirty that I had to use it once, then repeat.  After the second application with light brushing, the results were pretty amazing.  I applied the protective spray after the top dried.  It looks as close to new as I would have hoped for.

I went to Chemical Guys and we did an experiment using this product vs VRP gell. The VRP dried quickly and left darker color on the tires. I have done that again after I washed my car and did the experiment myself again and turns out the JAX wax left some oil streaks even though I haven't even sprayed on the tire but only on the sponge. I even kept scrubbing until no more solution was left but later after I drove a bit some oil streaks appeared compared with VRP Chemical Guys which was dryer, darker and even shinier. I posted two images; one using VRP and one using Jax Wax. You will notice that the one which has streaks belongs to JW versus the darker black one which belongs to VRP.

I have had this light on my Subaru for quite some time now. I really like it. I have had no problems with malfunctions or water intrusion. it is unbelievably bright. you will blind oncoming traffic even during the day. I will have to throw in that the adjustment screws on the mounts are a bit hard to get to once installed. I would buy this again without hesitation. do yourself a favor and buy a wiring harness to go with it. hope this review helps! This Is The Midwest Man. See Ya!

Easy installation. The short screw the manual said would go where the existing bracket was did not reach so I bought a longer one and used it. Fits nicely. I also installed ACE inner fenders here. My Jeep has a 2.5 lift and 35 NITTO G2 tires on 17x9 rims. Installed front and rear.

I wanted to help break up the white on my hood with some black. I considered the black-out vinyl but wanted something different. A lot of Wrangler owners say this looks like a Hummer hood. I disagree. Yes, it is similar, but on a Jeep it looks different. I blacked out my front grille, added the Bushwacker air deflector, and installed this Bestop Applique. I love the look and my jeep friends comment on it all the time. Very easy to install. Just make sure you follow the directions. If you are looking to break up the color on your Jeep, this will work great. I am very pleased.

That's what I tell people when I turn it on. Good god this thing is bright. I mounted it behind the grill of my expedition and even through the grill it lights up the road like the sun.I wired it to the fog lights for quick install - super easy, just disconnected one side fog light wire and connected it to the light bar.

UPDATE:  After 6 months of use this cargo carrier has failed miserably.  You will have to buy a hitch tightener but the worse part is that the bar that the carrier is on bends.  When I first placed the carrier on the back of my trailer it was to hold my generator.  The generator is an Energizer 2200 which the website says weights 70 pounds, then if you add 7 liters of gas that is another 11 pounds, I also put the 5 wood chock blocks and miscellaneous for around 20 pounds.  This gives the grand total of 101 pounds, plus the weight of the carrier at 39 pounds, total of the whole thing is 140 lbs.  The website says it has a "Robust 300 lbs Capacity".  If I only carry half of the capacity then why did the bar bend?I was worried that it was breaking the welds of the hitch but that is not the case.  It is hard to tell with the picture I am including but the whole cargo basket is tilted backwards.  It was not like this that when I initially put it on.The thin metal screen at the bottom can not be relied upon to tie anything down to.  It just seems a little shoddy.

Used them for a custom dual exhaust setup on my 2001 Chevrolet Impala LS. These are not as loud as other I have heard which makes them great for daily driving and long drives. They definitely have a nice rumble when you accelerate. You can see my videos to hear the exhaust in use. The thermal pictures show you how great they dissipate heat.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xycSuep_J8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCq0SX3QDwI

Ordered this for my KLR650. The bag of self seems to be in good quality, the zippers are nice and strong without interference. It is quite small but will hold two 16 ounce Cokes in them as long as I turn them at 45 degree angles. I can also get my wallet and a pair of gloves in as well and still close the bag. The magnets seem to be a little weak but I can't touch the magnetic wings under some of the fairing that holds a bit better. I've had it up over 90 miles an hour with a stock windshield and no problem with movement. Photo belowNo obvious problems, I'm just stingy getting out Stars. Mine did come with a rain cover as well which is an awfully nice touch

I've purchased LED bulbs for years now. Countless of styles from ebay, VLEDS.com, superbrightleds.com and countless other sites.  These are the brightest 194 bulbs I've ever had.  You can not look directly at them without your eyes involuntarily squinting shut.  You could use these as reverse lights if you wanted.  I used them for puddle lights and for the trunk of my car.  Absolutely great illumination.  The build quality is also very nice.  The bulbs are not polarity sensitive so they'll work in any orientation that you plug them in.  They fit very snug and the terminals are wide and flat ensuring good, solid contact which helps eliminate flickering due to loose fitting bulbs and connections.  Most other bulbs I've gotten have terminals no wider or stronger than a standard staple out of a desk stapler.  These bulbs have terminals that are about as wide and solid as a staple for coax cable out a staple gun.  I uploaded a picture of an eBay special bulb and this bulb.  The eBay bulb is the smaller one.  Clear difference in quality.

Fits and functions just as good as the original Hyundai part.  Even though this is a Gates part, it's stamped with the "S" logo by Stant.  No biggie, just thought I'd point that out.  Install is very easy. BE SURE THE CAR HAS COOLED DOWN COMPLETELY BEFORE ATTEMPTING REPLACEMENT!  FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN SEVERE BODILY INJURY. Simply twist the old cap off, and twist the new cap on.  It was raining when I installed mine, and I was done in less than 5 minutes, even with taking pictures. Very happy with this purchase.

I installed this on a 2015 Ram 2500 Mega Cab with the 6.4L V8 Hemi with a payload capacities just shy of 3,000 lbs. I bought these air bags to prevent my truck from squatting while hauling water and pulling my trailers.First off, I love the system and the simplicity of it all. I recommend these airbags to anyone looking to prevent their trucks from sagging under heavy loads. So why 4 stars? Well, these air springs state they have a load leveling capacity of up to 5000 lbs but I find that hard to believe. In the directions it states to inflate the air bags until you achieve your normal ride height. For my truck from the top of my rear tire, to the bottom of the corresponding fender its 10.5 inches. When I haul water I can't get above 9 inches of clearance with 95 psi. (Max is 100). I haul just less than 350 gallons of water as that's the max capacity of my tank. A gallon of water weighs approximately 8 lbs so that's roughly 2800 lbs. As per the manual it states that "The springs in this kit will support approximately 40 lbs of load (combined on both springs) for each 1 PSI of pressure."  This brings up two issues. First, the fact that 40 lbs * 100 psi = a max load leveling of 4000 lbs NOT 5000 lbs and second, that I should only need about 70 psi (give or take) to level my truck with the water tank... So why can 95 not get the job done? Because of these issues I give 4 of 5 stars.Installing the air springs was fairly simple, however the directions where not exactly clear and resulted in a lot of wasted time, checking, then rechecking to make sure everything was correct. So even though the process was simple it wasn't exactly easy. If I had to do it again, I could probably do it in about a half hour or just over. The hardest part is understanding how to assemble the air bags before mounting as the parts are slightly different for the left and right side, and the directions don't clearly show which way the plates face per side. I recommend cross referencing the diagram on page 3, even though it doesn't help with side specific parts. As a whole it's simple enough to install that if you have all the tools needed as per the instructions, you should be capable of installing it yourself.One thing the instillation instructions didn't mention is the use of a Air Brake Anti-Freeze, this additive helps prevent condensation, and moisture buildup inside of the air bags thus stopping potential damage as well as ice blocks inside the air lines. If you decide to purchase the wireless air compressor model # 7200 (which works great by the way) the instructions on that mention using "Gunk" brand Air Brake Anti-Freeze. But in order to add it when the air bags are installed, you practically have to completely remove them. So its best if you pick some up before you assemble the air bags if you live in an area that gets below freezing. See attached image for directions.After I installed the air bags, I had to plan on where to route my air lines. I had bought the air bags in conjunction with the wireless air kit mentioned above, so I knew I wouldn't have to fill them manually so I wouldn't need the included air valves. But based of someone else's review I decided it was best to just do it anyway and good thing to because the compressor that was sent to me had a piece broken off and wasn't usable. And I had to manually fill the air bags for the week it took Air Lift to send me a new compressor. 10 of 10 on their customer service. Anyway, the instructions showed a few different places you could mount the air valves but I ended up putting them about a food behind my rear tires mud flaps because there was already a hole there symmetrical on both sides of the truck. I just had to make the hole a little larger to fit the air valve and it was perfect.Not really sure what else to say besides that If you've been thinking about getting air bags because you haul, or tow a lot then you will be pleased with this set.NOTE: These air bags do not increase the payload capacity of your truck. They only effect ride quality, and height. It's not only the suspension that limits the payload of your truck its also the tires, wheels, hubs, axle. Even if they are all rated for more than what your truck is, the frame itself may not be. The payload capacity isn't a number that cant be fudged a little every now and then after all it is only a "Safe working load" but don't buy these air bags thinking your puny 1/4 ton truck can suddenly haul anything.

See my uploaded photo of the four LED bulbs I received. The metal contacts of the LED bulbs are much thinner than OEM bulbs. They have random lengths, and point up and side ways. There is no way that they will make secure contacts or even stay in the sockets. They are even of worse quality than the no-brand batch I bought last time (in which 3 out 4 still work after one week).Update: The seller acted in good faith and resolved the issue.

These worked perfectly in my 4x4 2003 F350. I never realized how much floating I had until I changed these out! Huge difference! If you're not sure if yours are bad get under the truck and try to move the sway bar side to side, if it moves side to side the bushings are bad. I replaced my sway bar links while I was at it as well! Will buy again when the time comes! In my pictures black is the old bushing and blue is the new.

1) It does not mount level to the car. Be prepared to buy washers to add between the car and the hitch to level it.  I did not realize this until I put everything back together so now my Cargo Carrier aims down.2) Mine came with a good size chip out of the paint... It isn't in a box or protected at all during delivery.3) It also rusted 2.3 seconds after I installed it.4)You have to drill out the access holes, cut away the heat shield from the muffler and cut away a significant portion of the black rear cover plastic.  Better have some metal cutting shears.  5) The muffler is also a pain in the rear to get in and out of the rubber holders, but you have to remove the muffler to get to the holes.Other than that... it works...

This is not a BEAM Wiper but a full windshield wiper.Also, this will NOT fit the 2007 Chevy new Silverado. In 2007 Chevy had two model Silverado pickups. Generally the earlier one is called "classic" and the newer one called "new" or "new body style".Otherwise, the wiper blade looks well built. However, it will only fit the wiper arms that have the "hook" end, which is on the early 2007 Chevy Silverado

This kit provided all we needed to wash/wax our vehicles. It went on and wiped off easily using the recommended Aero Cosmetics mop we also purchased through Amazon. If you're not using the product on an RV or tall truck, you could live without the mop. I was hesitant to try this since I always used paste wax or went to a car wash. I now wish I tried this a long time ago. It works!

So glad to get the chrome lugnuts off the Jeep.  Easy to swap 'em out (yeah, bought a 1/2 in electric impact driver from Harbor Freight).  Did the deed in the driveway.  Wrapped the lugnuts in a paper towel when installing, didn't want to scuff them up.  Fit well, look good.  Highly recommend for an inexpensive cosmetic/appearance change.

Item received promptly, and it did make a good impression.Comes with both a hole to snugly squeeze your antenna in, and an elastic loop in case you want to hang it from a hook or your rear view mirror.The photos included by the seller do not describe the shape or size of it properly.It is shown quite "chubby", while in reality the body is thin and long - around 4.3 in (110mm) from "sting" to the antennae.Colors are bright and I hope will some time after being exposed to the elements.Minor imperfections in the wings etc are hardly noticeable.The soft foam fits snugly around the antenna of my spouse's Corolla, and feels pretty secure.The elastic band will probably need to be trimmed off.

I'm a huge fan of Hardline Hour/Tach Meters, Have installed some units previously, In order to read rpm properly must select correct  spark firing setting with engine OFF after physical installation. if counting with any tiller outboard, it's a must have, excellent for traking run hours, maintenance intervals & rpm while boating, a great tool when going for prop maximizations. Like the leftover cut cable feature once pick up cable is properly routed from spark cable to tiller end. If plan rinsing outboard after salt water use, it's not 100% water or splash proof. Be aware that water could penetrate through toggle button sides inside unit and fog it. So if in need to wash tiller, cover it with a long plastic sheath sealed at end or cut a small 8-10 mm square portion of electric tape and tape it on top of toggle button to avoid water intrusion, both methods works very well. Stay away from cheapo hour/tachs, this is the one to go after, money well invested...

Update: 7/7/16 still loving them :)I installed these 2 months ago and the sun has discolored the red to an almost lighter color, exposing the aluminum. I love the levers but that's my only gripe. I emailed the seller (on a Saturday night) and he reponded saying they'll send me black adjusters! Hopefully they pan out and don't get killed by the sun... They look so good. I would 5 star it too but the dye they used for the color gets eaten by UV rays.

Yes, the bottle graphics has changed, but it is still a Dex-VI licensed fluid.The front of the bottle now just says multi-vehicle, but the back still states "Approved for GM Dexron-VI  (License J-62300)..." (my bottles were made 4/18/16).I don't understand why some are complaining that it is not true Dex VI fluid when the bottle clearly states it on the back.I bought this for a fluid and filter change on my mothers 2007 Saturn Vue with the GM 4T45-E. Although I have not used it yet, I have no concerns whatsoever that it is the correct fluid, and is a heck of a bargain.I just wanted to post some pics and help clear up that this is still licensed Dex-VI fluid. I will post a follow up once the fluid is changed (which will basically say "fluid works great").Edit 10/22/16: Fluid works greatChanged the fluid in the Vue  doing a drain and fill including a filter change (used 7.5 qts to get full) and it drives just fine. My mother states it feels like it shifts smoother now (I did not tell her I did anything to the transmission, so no bias on that). She took it on a 1000 mile trip plus lots of around town driving and works great. Again, a great bargain compared to other fluids (plus the next cheapest fluid is from Walmart and they never have more than 4 bottles on the shelf it seems).

Product is as advertised, mostly, except for the "rugged epoxy powder coated finish for unmatched durability and corrosion protection." I pulled that straight from the product description. It hasn't proven true for mine. I'm including a few pics of the rusted out ends of my T-3. It's been on my vehicle hitch for about 2 1/2 years now.To be fair, I must say that the little rubber end cap has very effectively sealed the lock portion inside though; it looks virtually brand new and functions fine. The T-3 appears very solid and strong, and I have and still would trust it to tow and secure whatever my vehicle can handle.So, since the issue is just cosmetic right now, I'll still give the product 3 stars. But the rust issue is a real turn-off. Maybe I'll contact Trimax and see what they have to say and offer me, since they do say this product has a lifetime warranty. Or, Bolt Lock has a receiver lock that I'm pretty interested in too.

I gave up on a cheaper gun that gave me fits with air pockets and purging them. This gun was terrible for the first cartridge, but has not had an issue at all since that first one. All changes since have gone without a hitch. 20 minutes of frustration was guaranteed with each cartridge change with the older gun. I have read on here that some people have issues with the gun "firing" every 2 seconds as long as it is connected to an air source. The grease gun uses an O ring in the valve which is very susceptible to dirt in the air line. I fixed that issue too. The grease gun will not misfire unless there is a leak in the valve, which means dirt. It is a great gun and removed a lot of frustration for me.

After hearing a clanking underneath my truck bed every time I went over bumps, I knew I was overdue for a set of shocks. My old ones were so worn that I was able to fully compress them by hand. I've had the new ones on for about 500 miles and they make the rear end of my 06' Dodge Ram 1500 feel like new.  Much more controlled at higher speeds and around turns, especially while hauling or towing!

Works fine for my application of quick disconnect of my elec trolling motor from on board deep cycle battery.  I wanted to be able to quickly remove my trolling motor from the bow mount assembly on the boat.  You need to be able to solder heavy guage wire to disconnect metal tabs. The tabs come out of the plastic housing to allow soldering.  You'll need a plumbers propane copper pipe soldering torch. I had no problems with it. My trolling motor lead wires are 8 gauge and they fit perfectly into the disconnect tabs for soldering. I put a dab of clear silicon into the back of the finished connections.

Really, really nice addition for your winch. Put this on because I don't like the hook locked on to the side or the synthetic line hanging out. seems like  minor fender bender could damage your rope or some d bag backing into it when parallel parking. This took all of 2 minutes to install. So easy I did it twice just to make sure it was correct. The rubber bumpers are perfect up against the hawse fairlead. Was thinking of the thimble, but wanted it to fit behind the front plate. With the ARB bumper there is probably plenty of room to go with the thimble. However, this flat link is really nice. Pricey and worth it if you have the extra money laying around.

HONDA CIVIC 1995 - It took me awhile to take the old Exhaust off. 20 years Old. New Exhaust was pretty easy and sounds great. I left the silencer attached and used high temperature gasket sealer between the parts to insure a solid fit with no leaks. It helped with passing emissions testing with flying colors!!

Work as they should, you can see the attached picture on how I used them. I removed them from the housing they come in and installed them into a panel I made in my Jeep.  Easy to wire up and make for a clean install. I have also used these for installing in boats, airplanes, and other cars.

Great center console for the money for my 1993 jeep wrangler yj. The spice color matches really well also. It is true that it is too wide but it does fit non the less. Moving the passenger seat up and down is kind of a pain because the seat belt always gets stuck.I give three stars because 2 of the nuts were missing, and the nuts that came with it were standard and the bolts metric. Also the front most anchor bolt was too long so I pretty much had to buy all new hardware.The locking mechanism worked well but I modified it and put a combination cam lock in so I don't need an extra key. The lock is called a Combi Cam

This tool is very handy, but it is not a quality tool.  I knew when I bought it, that it wouldn't last too long.  It was very convenient while it worked.  This tool easily removes spark plug wires from small engines, and it works on most cars that have a typical spark plug boot.  The metal is very flimsy and it eventually snapped in half.

I ordered the clock and thermometer separately to get the matching white face so it matched the speedometer. There was an offer of the combo together but the clock had a black face. No problem just a little more money ordering separately. I planned on placing the clock and thermometer on the handlebar on each side of the middle (of the center of the fork). It looked like plenty of room and appeared to be a straight bar but apparently where the center anchor bolts were for the handlebars it was not perfectly round. Subsequently did not fit on the 1" handle bar at that location. I positioned them higher on the handlebars on left & right side. They are now at an angle but I can read them OK. I uploaded a couple pics which I think will clarify my description.  My motorcycle is a 2006  V-Star Silverado 1100. I have had the clock & thermometer on for a couple days now and the clock has been accurate. The Thermometer is within a couple degrees of my garage thermometer so close enough for me. I am satisfied with the purchase entirely.

This was for a 2000 Monte Carlo SS, it was a direct fit! I would have given it a 5 star except that the label pocket was on the pipe and was hard to get all of it off, which had to be burned off by the heat of the exhaust after installation and it stunk for a bit. I suggest you get the O2 sensor cince you are replacing the CAT already. And of course the gaskets! Don't skimp and get a cheaper CAT! You will be replacing it in a years time like I just did! I attached some pics of the install

After some investigation I came across these two parts on Amazon at a great price, cheaper than the dealer or most other websites.After installation everything works fine, I'm happy with the quick shipping and the general quality of the product.  What's weird is Amazon tells me this doesn't fit my vehicle but the ACDelco 15-72275 Heater Blower Control Switch does.  These two are mated and so it should be updated to reflect that.  I've included some pictures as the product homepage, ACelco-dot-com does not do a good job showing the pins and different angles.I'm happy I was able to fix this at a fraction of the cost of buying a used or new climate control module

I love this rack.  Very well-built.  It works perfectly on my 2014 Toyota Highlander Limited.  Installed in minutes.  I used it on a recent camping trip.  Drove from Arcadia, CA to Shaver Lake, CA.  On the way up I did not overload it with stuff.  Drove the entire way at highway speeds (70 - 75 mph) and did not notice any increase in wind noise.  Loaded it up a bit more on the way down and still did not notice any increase in wind noise.This rack is worth the extra dollars.  I tried the Curt rack and it did not fit my Highlander.  The Rhino is noticeably a better made product as well.  This Rack is a lifesaver for our camping trips.  Now the kids don't have to be fully barricaded with gear piled up next to them!

These fit perfect on my 07 KLR650. Some people in the reviews said their daystar fork boots are going on 10 years and still holding strong. Make sure you order the 13" F00058-BK-04, not BK-02! I made that mistake already and the 02's are tiny, for a 125cc or smaller, so remember to get the BK-04!

This hitch fits my 2007 Yaris hatch- back like it was made by Toyota!  All that is visible is the square black receiver, which is a tiny 16th of an inch below my bumper and actually is higher than the muffler tail pipe, so no scraping.  That said, it was a difficult install.  I didn't need to go get my Automotive Project Handbook of Handy Curses, because I already know a few curses...  The product itself is well designed and blameless for the difficulty, but top bolt removal / re- installation was very difficult, as there is little room to work.  I actually ended up using a large button magnet on the back of a ratcheting box end wrench to get the old bolts out and the new bolts in.  A socket and 3/8 drive ratchet would loosen the old bolt, but then the thickness of the socket on ratchet combo plus the length of the backed-out old bolt would not allow removal, as the ratchet was hard up against the back of the steel bumper!  Use a slim ratcheting box-end wrench, with a magnet over the back to keep the bolt from sliding through the ratchet.  This works well, as the magnet holds the old and then the new bolt from falling out of the ratchet.  You won't be able to place the two top bolts with your hand - too tight of a work space!  Of course the four old bolts to be removed were a bit corroded, being 9 years on the back end of a car.  The Hitch Kit included new bolts and washers, which went in like a breeze.  Do slide those two new top bolts carefully up on their screw ends, or your ratchet/magnet combo will stick to the back of the steel bumper, necessitating more cursing... So, a middling difficult job with tight work space for 2 upper bolts and mild corrosion in an older car, but only 4 bolts total and so well worth the effort.  Took me an hour to do.

These LEDs are crazy bright! I installed them in my 2007 BMW 335i, and they look worlds brighter than the incandescent bulbs from the factory. At first, I thought they might be too bright, but they do look pretty cool. Also, they're a nice white light, as opposed to many LEDs you buy, which are a bluish tone. As for the build quality, for the price, they seem really great. I definitely recommend these lights.

Puller worked fine, unfortunately the pulley was so firmly attached to the shaft that the pulley lip was torn and deformed trying to remove it.  (See photo).  I cut the shaft and hit with a 3 pound sledge.  Didn't budge.  Put the pulley on a 6 ton press, didn't budge.  I heated up and tried again, no luck.  Then I ground flats on the shaft stub (see photo), put in a heavy vise, and attempted to turn the pulley with a 3-foot bar in both directions to break it free.  Didn't move.  Tried with heat.  Nothing.  Gave up, ordered a pulley from Diesel Conversion Specialists (thanks to other reviewers for tip).  Dealer does not have pulley available, must buy a new pump, pulley and bracket if going that route ($1000)!

Hooked it to my Honda EU2000 generator . Just coil the wire around the spark plug wire connection and thats it.... thru induction it knows the engine is running and starts the clock you will see the hour glass symbol flash.... every 6 minutes equal .1 on the clock .  I used double sided mounting tape (not included) to mount it on the generator. Great for the price !

You get what you pay for. I bench tested it and it was accurate across the board. Cheap plastic, but it works. Needle rests at about 3lb on vac side.When others say the light is bright, they aren't lying. It's the sun! I have it on my dimmer and at low light settings the light flickers. I'm going to put a resistor inline to it to dim it down and hope it doesn't flicker.If the light wasn't so bright, it would be decent.For the price, it's hard to say it's trash.

This tape is really high quality reflective tape! I purchased this to put on my motorcycle helmet and on the saddlebags (I know my cool factor went down to nerd). Living in LA, drives just aren't paying attention. I am tired of near misses so I decided to get this tape. This is very sturdy and isn't flexible but really great reflection. I am including a picture of the helmet (only one side). This was taken in a completely dark room, using on the cell's flash and about 5 feet away.This does have the DOT stamp on itQuick shipping and super happy with it!

Well, joke is on me for buying these expecting to need them for my 98 m3.  Turns out I didn't need them until a year later when an 02 sensor failed, so I dig these out of the garage and what do I find?  Seller had mislabeled one of them - so I purchased two - but I received one for a 98 M3 and one for a 96 land cruiser... So I assume I'm SOL because I didn't check my order when I got it... Still a bit bummed to find out I overpaid by $20 for the wrong part.  Seller, any interest in refunding the difference to make up for the error?

Perfect fit for an 03-09 4runner! I added it strictly for appearance, and based on how I mounted, there is no way it would affect sound. The exhaust barely slides over the factory tailpipe, so you must remove the mounting hardware altogether, however, I did put one screw back in on the side that is least noticeable to ensure that it does not fall off.  I am hoping to add a photo or so as well.

This is a nice bumper light bar, it is heavy duty. I looked at most of the brands available and this was by far the best deal. This bar does require that you trim some plastic or remove it completely. The instructions are more complicated than they need to be. The instructions contradict themselves but are easy to figure out.  If you have OCD it will drive you crazy getting everything perfect but it is possible. One nice thing with this bar vs Mopar bar is the brackets have the nut built into it, so no fighting holding a nut in place. The Mopar bar doesn't require trimming with the way the brackets are shaped but these bars are more sturdy.

Excellent light. super bright and has worked well, the mounts leave a bit to be desired. But for $180 and a 52in curved led that lights up the night like day, its well worth the money. All i would have liked is a little better mounts and it did come dented, and all a sudden isn't for sale anymore. Overall great light for the money.I camo'd it with Rustoleum Camo Colors and a clear matte finish,Last pics are my Anso USA projector headlights, then the light bar, incredibly bright!

This stuff it the nuts! I am restoring an old enduro motorcycle and when I bought it, the side cover was in pieces. 45+-year-old plastic is brittle and it was in several pieces. I shopped a replacement and the cheapest I could find was $100.00. I bought this kit thinking it may help til I could find a reasonably priced replacement. I got the kit and started working. In literally 2 hours, I had refurbished my existing panel and doubt that I will have to look for another. Simple process and great results. One thing that I should mention is that it was very easy for me in that I could use the back side of the panel to apply the fix and didn't need to worry about appearance. That said, v-grooving and filling with the compound allows it to be ground and sanded like bondo and makes a very good finish. I am attaching pics and I doubt that you can see the part that I did fill, sand and smooth. Pics are before. during and after. Obviously the gray is the finished project.

Used twice - filled transfer case and front differential on my truck. Because the fluids were different for each, I used brake clean to flush out the oil. During the second fill, I noticed cracks develop on the plastic case which eventually leaked oil all over my hands. Worked very well when the case was intact. It now resides in a landfill. Replaced with a metal one - no problems.

Start off with opening the box. When I pulled the bars out of the box, there were some scratches. They were on the bottom so I'm not too concerned.The instructions were not the clearest but I managed. One of the steps calls for taking out a body mount bolt which I wasn't able to do...yet. I suggest pneumatic tools for that.Install took about 2 hrs, mostly due to using the wrong washers on the wrong bolts.Quality of the bars is good. I don't believe they are powder coated since there are surface scratches out of the box. Grade 8 bolts came with the install kit. All brackets and hardware was included.

I painted the calipers on my 2005 Accord and it looks pretty good. The paint is decent paint and you get more than enough for two coats. The brush is kind of suspect tho. Before painting I prepared both calipers.  I didn't use the brush that came with the kit. I purchased one a bit better. After prep, taping, painting, I must say that it looks pretty good.

I don't know how many times (and I'm sure we've all been there) I've had to wedge my hand in between the seat and the console to try and find what fell and then get on my knees to look under the seat. Some items are probably still there, never to be seen again.Then comes this set of two clever car pocket organizers that fit in between the seat and the console. They're a light brown, definitely smell of leather, and very well made and sturdy. They're 14" long by 4 1/2" deep and have an opening of between 1" and 1 3/4" (determined by how much space there is). The leather is doubled over on the top and held with three rivets on each side. Depending on how close the seat is to the center console, the organizer may slip right in between or may need to be wedged in. In our truck they fit right in the space like they were made for it.What a convenient spot to put keys, your phone, a tablet, pencil, pen, even a little notebook (and I mean the kind with lines that you can write in). No more dropping items onto the floor. This is something you don't know you need until you have it; who knew that there was a product like this out there (not me).{Sample provided at a substantial discount for review}

You get what you pay for, avoid the other imported no name knock offs, the4 BendPak is the real deal, thicker steel, better welding and hydraulics.My photos show how to get it off the pallet all by yourself.Tip: get a Parker Hannifin 4000 series quick disconnect, mount it on the hose at the power unit,makes it so easy to store the power unit away from your lift.Full face quick disconnect (one each of these) 1/4" NPT Set (M+F) full face quick disconnect1/4" NPT to #6 ORB adapter1/4" NPT to #4 JICAdd a pair of rubber covers to protect the full face couplings.I was going to buy the 60P but for a $200 more you get more height and dual hydraulic cylinders.

This jacket is as far as I can tell the upgraded version of the bloodaxe jacket. My first and only jacket so far has been the bloodaxe. After receiving this jacket and feeling the quality and how it handles at speed I'm very happy. This jacket looks great and has plenty of padding. I was worried because it does not advertise that it also has a back pad. It in fact does, and I feel very safe while wearing this.  If you like leather and the protection it offers, for the price I don't think this jacket can be bested. The only jacket I have seen comparable to this are more than double the price. The jacket is stuff at first but wears in over time. Overall great jacket and I love the looks.

I am very guilty about not carrying around a tire pressure gauge in my car. Part of the reason is because I don't know exactly how to read them. The ones with the little pop-up stick are just a little confusing to me and so I don't check my tire pressure like I should. This heavy duty pressure gauge is a great option for people like me that just want to be able to have an easy read. The gauge is built great and is very easy to read and use. It takes up a little extra room in the glove box, but it's not so much that it's not worth having along for the ride."This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

Great buy for genuine Toyota floor mats. Fits my wife's 2016 Highlander XLE perfectly. Beats all other competition in quality, looks and price. Literally sells for half the price of Weather Tech. The mats have raised edges that contain the dirt and crap in. I do have to say i was confused with some of the comments that talked about a third row mat as being included. If you look at my pictures, the box clearly states two piece or three piece available. The three piece set is when the middle row is separated into two mats, but it does not include anything for the third row. I would ask the seller to work with Amazon to remove the comments about the third row seat mats being included because they are not. These reviews got me confused and I'm sure others were as well.

I would have given these 5 stars, but I was sent two different bulbs. One of them fit but the other didn't. However, the one that did fit looked amazing. I had the GP Thunder 7500K before this and I always made excuses saying they were white enough. But after installing these 6000K ones, I can't believe the difference. And this is in the day time!! I'm gonna take a final pic at night to see how bright they are and hope I get sent better ones next time.

After warming the covers near a baseboard heater they slid on the frames with a little work.  It's important to follow the directions on the order of installation!Considering I have used them on a YJ with half doors and a CJ hard top, they seal fairly well.It is after all a Jeep. I don't expect anything to be perfect.Quality is very good.Zippers work very well.

I received a boxed kit that included the 16 ounce bottle of Liquid Gloss Poly Wax, a 4.5 inch foam hand waxing pad, and a very nice padded microfiber towel that works wonderfully.  At this time, I don't see this particular kit available on Amazon, but it is on Griot's website.  Any wax pad and microfiber cloth will work, or an automatic buffer, if you happen to have one.Since it's still snowy and cold here, I didn't get to hand wash our 2012 Silverado before using this, but I did give it a good wash at our local car wash on a cold day, so there wasn't a lot of melted snow or salt spray on the drive home.  We have heat in our garage that keeps temps around 50-55 degrees so I allowed 30 to 35 minutes after application, as instructions advise.  I only applied the wax to about half of the hood to see how well this worked as I do want to hand wash the vehicle before I wax the whole thing.  There are some dried bug splatters left from fall yet that I don't want to embed in the poly wax.To be honest, I had to look really hard to see much change after wiping the wax off.  The truck had a pretty good finish on it to begin with.  What I did notice was a clear, smooth coating over a few dried on bug/dirt specks and a deeper, glossy finish on the waxed side.  I can't wait to see the finish after I have the chance to hand wash and detail it right.  Come on Spring!I have to say that this is the easiest wax product I've ever used.  It went on quickly and buffed off almost effortlessly!  It doesn't take a lot of product for each application so many waxes are possible from one bottle.I haven't used Griots products before but will look for them in the future.  I'm always on the lookout for products that will take minimal time and give great protection and results, helping to prolong the life of our vehicles.I will watch the performance of the area I waxed and update my review accordingly.  Also, I will re-post after I have the chance to do the whole truck.In the picture I included, the waxed side is on the right, a bit over half of the hood.  It's difficult to see any change in the pic but it is noticeable in person.

I was apprehensive about purchasing this product after reading some of the reviews.  This SS fit just fine on my 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  I reused all my mounting hardware except for a new sleeve.  This SS is not replacing the OEM SS so I am already using different hardware.  The hardware on the left in the photo fit my application.  SS is made in Mexico and the hardware in the USA.

The Spectra Premium 93069 Heater Core was a perfect fit for our 2001 Grand Cherokee Laredo.  It arrived in perfect condition and slipped right into place.  The foam prevents rattles and also makes sure that air goes through the core and doesn't leak around the edges of it.However, Jeep should be ashamed for making it so difficult to replace such a failure-prone part.  Swapping this part involves emptying the a/c refrigerant, removing the steering column, the center console, the ENTIRE dashboard and finally the HVAC box.  Then with just 3 more screws the old heater core just slides out.  :-(  This is a job that would cost you several hundred dollars to have done at a shop.Be sure to fix the a/c duct air leaks while you have it all apart.  I've attached a picture of the self-stick weatherstripping I installed, to replace the rotted/missing factory foam seals that leak most of the air under the dash instead of out through the dash vents. The weatherstrip is part number 01058 at O'Reilly Auto Parts (I couldn't find a listing for it on Amazon) and made a HUGE difference in the amount of air coming out of all the dash vents.  I was able to peel the old foam tape off of the housing and then kept cleaning the surfaces with rubbing alcohol and a paper towel until the towel stayed clean.  Once it was fully clean and dry, I then installed the weatherstrip.  We used to have to run the a/c blower on high, now just the 2nd position does a nice job.If you aren't sure if you're up to this job, I highly recommend that you watch the YouTube video posted by briansmobile1, titled "Grand Cherokee Heater Core Removal High Detail" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvdhusnuFUU  He walks through all of the steps required to get to the heater core.  NOTE: There's one bolt that's nearly straight up from the steering shaft.  In the video, it looks like a firewall-mounted bolt, however, it is a bolt that comes straight down, way up towards the top of the dash.  You're welcome.  ;-)  (Took me a while to find it.  You'll need to get your head down where the pedals are to see it.)

This transmission radiator was so easy to install on my wife's 2011 Subaru Forester, I was pleasantly surprised. I found a video online for a 2011 Subaru Outback and it was nearly identical. It was so similar that I had no issues removing the bumper and attaching the radiator by myself. It would be handy to have a helper, but if you are careful and patient it's not a problem to do alone. I do also have some nice 6" plastic ramps https://smile.amazon.com/RhinoGear-11909-RhinoRamps-Vehicle-Capacity/dp/B006EGAIII/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1478397697&sr=8-1&keywords=rhino+ramps to raise the front of the car off the ground, so I didn't have to squeeze under. We bought and installed this in July 2016 for towing our tiny hard side pop up camper up Colorado mountains. I don't have temperature readings from before and after, since the car doesn't read that out the OBD II port, but considering this radiator is a good fraction of the size of the original one and this works in series with the original it can't hurt.

Absolutely the cheapest POS I have ever bought through Amazon. The display was junk from first power up. Couldn't tell what the RPM was on the display. Luckily Amazon was amazing and took it back w/o issue. Attached pic is at 0 rpm.

I ordered 2 flood lights for backing up, flush mounted them in the bumper. And two flush mount in the grille. Very bright, look great.. until a year later. The black paint started to flake off of the metal face plate so I repainted them with bedliner. And they always have moisture in the lense. Looks cheap. Now two years later, my paint job held up better than the original paint, and they still have moisture in them and now one of the reverse pods doesnt work. I was happy for a year with them, now its just ugly to look at. Poor product if you want them for over a year. Went through all that work mounting them to find out they aren't worth it.

Great for about 3 months. I purchased 10 of these. 4 of them were flickering from day one. The rest started flickering after about 3 months. The hue and brightness was pleasant, price was great, but 3 months of service makes these worthless.

Price, Product, & ServiceI bought this as a lubricant for using clay on the paint. For this use It has a great dilution ratio. However before diluting, I used it straight on plastic body molding in a side by side comparison with another product that was designed to restore the color back to black. In this side by side the Garry Dean's did a better job, with a more natural finish. I did this just before a rain and both products had water streaks which were easy to remove. Being in S. California rain is not our normal its hot dry air full of pollutants.I have also purchased a product that is suppose to provide high UV protection, and it also did a nice job on my trucks plastic trim but at first rain it also streaked it was also easy to wipe the streaks off.So considering the original purpose I bought the Garry Dean's 5 Stars and For the extra bonus of restoring weathered plastic trim 5 Stars.

It's a great product. It was kind of a pain in the butt to take the screws out of the seat but once they're loosened, it's a piece of cake from there. Turn toward the seat, not away. That was my first mistake. I found it to be easier after I removed the door too. As for the product itself, it fit like a glove. I'm glad I now have somewhere to keep my valuables besides the glove box and middle console.

Mounting brackets nothing like either type shown in the pictures. Will update review once installed on the actual performance of the light bar. I just hate it when you think you are going to get one thing and it turns out to be something else.Follow up: Light does work great. Puts out plenty of light. I was expecting more coverage to the sides from the flood light part. Most of the light is concentrated to the front. Mounting brackets are showing signs of rust already.

This DBPOWER 5-in1 Digital Tire Pressure Gauge/Multi Tool is quite a nice little gadget to have. This is a tire gauge with an LED digital display. Very clear and easy to read and there is a good amount of light with the LED backlight display. Also checks in 4 different pressure units:  PSI, BAR, KPA and KGF/CM2, and accuracy to +/- 1 PSI. Takes 2 AAA batteries that were not included but not an issue with me because I always keep extra batteries in the house.The 4 other tools that come on this is a flashlight, seat belt cutter, glass breaking tool and a red safety light. Nice in size with a perfect weight. Can keep in your car or garage or even toss in your purse or duffel bag if you wanted. Comfortable to hold and use and has a rubber gripping handle. Definitely loving this and the emergency extra are great on this and I would completely recommend this!**I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

Plug and play installed, didn't take long, one thing I didn't like was wire going out to trunk door to connect to trailer, I modified mine by drilling hole inside the spare tire wall and lead the wire to the hitch. Bolted the 4way plug to bumper... I'm happy with connection. Works awesome.

Used these to trailer my 2004 FLSTFI and my father's VN800B from Phoenix to Santa Barbara and back and from Phoenix to just outside of Death Valley. I have been strapping bikes and ATV's for the past 26 years and these have been the best straps I have ever owned. Virtually no stretching, easy to use and I love the safety clips. Keeps them from falling off the floor eyes when your wrapping the other end. Well worth it, I'd buy them again.

Nice quality, secure, effective. I liked the locknuts for peace of mind.  I am using these on a coolant reroute for my Miata. The rear connection is hard to reach, but this product allows me to reach the clamp from the top.  The wider clamp offers more surface area than most worm gear clamps. I would recommend!

This is a deluxe over the seat organizer for your vehicle. It goes over the back of a bucket seat and contains multiple pockets to place a variety of items. The straps fasten securely and are adjustable, so it will fit seats in most vehicles. The material is durable and can be washed. This is a useful item to have to reduce clutter in your car.

This is the ubiquitous Battery Tender Jr., manufactured by Deltran. There are quite a few float charger type products out there that bill themselves as "battery tenders" but the actual product name of this is "Battery Tender Jr." - they have other Battery Tender products, including one with higher charging output, and one with more outputs for charging multiple batteries.But let's first get back to basics: what is a float charger, and why is it needed?Lead-acid batteries, of the type used in cars and motorcycles, lose a part of their charge over time just sitting when they aren't even connected to something. When left in a bike that has a clock or radio memory circuit in it that constantly draws power even when the bike is off, that loss of charge is even faster.Lead-acid batteries "like" to remain at full charge at all times. A battery that is kept at full charge will have a much longer service life than a battery that is left sitting with less than a full charge.I used to go through a lot of batteries - my motorcycle batteries would last between one and two years before they needed replacement. With multiple motorcycles (not to mention other battery powered things like a generator, snow blower, etc.) this gets expensive!I figured I would put a trickle (float) charger on my main GL1100 battery to help keep it fully charged. I bought a cheap trickle charger from Harbor Freight, for under $10. I hooked it up to the battery and left it sitting overnight. The next day, to my utter surprise, the battery was dead! The cheap trickle charger, with no intelligence in it and no way of turning off when the battery was charged, overcharged the battery, destroying it! I could charge it fully, but its plates were sulfated, and it would no longer produce enough current to start the bike. This was an expensive lesson - and taught me about the false economy of Harbor Freight float chargers!So it was with a bit of trepidation that I tried the Battery Tender Jr. - I didn't really want to throw another $100 down the drain for another new battery. The difference with the Battery Tender products is that they are intelligent: they have computers inside that analyze the state of charge of the battery to which they are connected, and alter their output to adjust: Initialization, Bulk Charge Mode, Absorption Mode, Float Mode).The result: I'm still using that battery five years later, and it still works like it is brand new. I was so impressed that I bought more: I now own five Battery Tender Jr.'s, and they are connected to all of my bikes and devices, 24/7. Every time I park my bike, I plug it in. I have not had a single battery go bad in the five years since I have started using Battery Tenders - and every battery still performs like it is brand new.The Battery Tender Jr. comes with a 12 foot cord and a plug. This plug then attaches to one of two included connectors: a set of alligator clips, for temporary attachment to a battery, or a set of ring terminals, for permanent attachment. I use the ring terminals, then feed the other end of the connector up through the bike somewhere where it can be hidden. In my wife's PC800, the connector hides behind the right passenger footpeg. In my GL1500, it hides in the left passenger cubby. When I park the bike, I simply flip open the cubby, plug in the Battery Tender, and I know the battery is protected and maintained.The Battery Tender is designed to be pretty much indestructible. You can hook it up backwards to the battery, and nothing will happen. You can start the bike with it connected, no problem, it simply turns itself off. It's spark proof, and has an indicator light that flashes and changes color to tell you the state of your battery, and what it is doing to manage it. It has a five year warranty, which I have not had to use.The Battery Tender works great on standard flooded wet-cell lead-acid batteries, as well as AGM (absorption glass mat) batteries. If you have a gel-cell battery, there is a different version that has programming to work properly with them.And you can now get accessories that plug into the Battery Tender vehicle-side connector when the Battery Tender is not connected. These provide USB charging outputs and 12 volt cigarette lighter-style power ports to allow you to plug your electronic devices into your vehicle. See more about these accessories here: Battery Tender USB Charger and 12 volt SocketOverall, this is one of my favorite products, they work amazingly well, keep your batteries in top shape, and cost less than a quarter of the cost of a single new battery. I can't recommend them highly enough.

Excellent quality and craftsmanship.  It far exceeded what I expected from Bell.  My head felt  comfortable on my face was well cradled. I wear an XL in the numerous Icon motorcycle helmets I have in my collection so I ordered the same size and jackpot, it fit perfectly. The light blue stands out great in the crowd or traffic even though it's probably one of the most difficult colors to match. The brown lining in the inside looks very high-end and well manufactured.

Bought a pair about 10 months ago ... the lights themselves are OK but the support 'BRACKETS'  provided rusted in an area that gets very little rain. I mounted a pair of these to the rear of the vehicle. Last week I just happened to notice brown spots on the rear of the vehicle below the lights. At first I thought it was pollen or 'bird Dodo' but it turns out to be rust dripping off the brackets unto the finish of my vehicle. I've got rust stains now on the rear of my new vehicle. Ahhh! Be warned!

Used this on my 1996 Pace Arrow Vision. The step has 2 steps, mdl 32.pic 1 and 2 The replacement gear box required some modification to fit. I used the original gear of the old motor, the new one would not fit and I did not use the 2 washers. I had to grind clearance in the new gear box so the motor would fit flush. pic 3. I had to drill the motor bolt holes out with a 15/64 drill so the new larger bolts would fit. pic 4 and 5. I also sealed where the motor bolts up to the gear box with RTV. The motor mounts in a slightly different position pic 6 and I had to make room on the step by bending bracket over with a large Cresent wrench pic 7 and 8. My step all bolt were SAE and the new gear box was metric. Pic 9 thru 11 are for reference. All mounted up and works great. The motor reminds me of the motor that is used in my 1993 Ford pick up power windows.

The only reason I'm giving this bar a 4-star review is because mine came with no instructions and was missing 2 bolts. The bar itself is a good quality and looks great. I was able to reuse some factory hardware so it was not a big deal. KC also had the directions on their website, so I just went there and figured it out.  Overall I would recommend this to someone who wants the "older" light-bar look for the TJ wrangler. This is a good alternative to the LED bars which I like but not on the older wranglers.

Not all Jeepers are made of money.  If you can not afford aftermarket rims, get Jeep Wrangler Canyon Rims.  Then get the two inch spacers to augment the Canyon rims.  It makes your vehicle not so topsy turvy and makes for a much better ride!  Slap on 33x12.5 R15 BF Goodrich All Terrain K/M with your OEM Canyon Rims with the spacers and your Jeep is ready for hard adventure!  I took them into abused logging trails the first day after installation.  These spacers are hub-centric and wheel-centric for a very firm fit.  They smooth out my 4.5 inch lifted wrangler.  It had top heavy wobble and rocking when going over bumps a lot!  Do not think about this.  Just buy them if you can not afford properly offset rims.This is the best upgrade since my 4.5 inch suspension lift.

This oil has legit Euro specs, not "recommended for" like Valvoline or others. Pretty good in cold verses 5w-30 which is still thinner for winter. WAY LESS thick in cold than 5w-40, like 3-4x tinnner in cold....which is a big deal if you have a turbo so the oil can make it thru the lines on start-up.In most all cases, the Mobil 1 0w-40 is excellent, but I still prefer the Pennzoil PureBase made with a gas-to-liquid process, meaning no crude oil to refine... a truly "synthetic" process. Still the Mobil 1 is meets spec for our new VW, so I'm using it in my car and keeping the receipts for the VW, which gets PZ Platinum PureBase since it's brand new. Mobil 1 0w-40 in jugs certainly makes using spec oil easy. It's not just for Euro cars which call for a thicker oil, it's a great choice for many modded engines from a Civic to a Mustang etc.See, the extra thickness of a Euro spec oil is intended as a buffer for drivers going flat out on the Autobahn for hours at a time. We simply don't have those driving conditions in the USA, which would overheat the oil....short of towing, etc. So most drivers of Euro cars can go around with good 5w-30 just fine, I use it in winter because it's thinner in cold, and the 0w-40 in summer. Not a big fan of the regular Mobil 1 oil, but the High-Miles formula is Excellent for Euro cars. Slightly thicker and extra additives to help with our poor fuel quality in USA....alcohol and sulphur. Low additive formulas like Mobil 1 ESP for VW 504 work poorly with our fuels, and are made for Euro quality fuels. VW 504/507 is fine for TDI, just for the record. 504 cannot be back-speced to VW 502, although it is claimed. 502 is simply a weak old spec, that newer oils blow away. Really 5w-40 is obsolete for many applications as well, in cold forget it. That dealer Syntec 5w-40 VW 502 is crap, and old high magnesium formula for diesel engines.Still, I use PZ Platinum 5w-30 without specs, also the Viper spec 0w-40 that is a little different than the PZ Euro 0w-40....those specs just add to the cost....$500k for 3yr licence to sell VW spec oil. Yeah, I swap winter and summer oil...but with 0w-40 you really don't have to outside of Arctic conditions. If the cold is that bad, might want to jump down to 0w-20 anyway.

This is my second clutch from them. The first one wouldnt enguage out of the box til I smacked it then I blew the motor that had the clutch so with a new motor I bought a new clutch. This clutch has failed at 19.1 hours of abuse. In those 19.3 hours were 10 hours of off roading, and 6 gokart tires of burnouts. At 18.7 hours I was riding in the woods when my wheel got stuck on a tree root and I tried to throttle out of it. This is when it slipped for the first time. It was smokey but after pushing out of it it rode fine until 19 hours came. I was causially Street riding when I came to a stop and it was not really picking up speed in lockup until 2.5k rpm when it use to be 1.65rpm. I tried hill climbing and it didn't go until 3.1k. On my way back it was getting worse and worse to the point it was sounding like a CVT. I parked it at 19.1 hours. The next day I rode it, it still sounded liek a cvt and leaving a cloud of smoke. I was at 5krpm slowly picking up then it locking up once on speed and I tried to go up my driveway on a hill. This was the end. I full pedaled and it was at 7356rpm constant and not going anywhere. I fogged so much smoke I couldn't see I front of me and when I stopped, the bell was Red hot. I pulled the rope again and bypassed the pedal and 9krpm got me up the driveway until the garage bump when it was standing still. It was a fun 19.3 hours and I bought a new one that comes tomorrow. You can't go wrong with this clutch.

I was really excited about purchasing this set of wheel brushes.  I've been looking for one that was good quality and relatively inexpensive and this seemed to fit the bill.  I've used it twice now and it's a solid set of products.  The bristles are nice and firm, perfect for wheel cleaning in my opinion.  I agree with some of the other reviewers and I would hesitate to use this on paint.  Wheels, interiors, and such are fine though.I did not give this product 5 stars for two reasons.  First, the product description claims the brushes are 1", 1.5", and 2" in diameter.  Somebody even asked the question about what sizes these were and HomeChic clearly responded and said they were 1", 1.5", and 2".  However, when measured, they are actually 1", 1.25", and 1.5".  I've attached a photo to show this.  This is really disappointing as one of the main reasons I purchased this was for the 2" brush.  .Secondly, on the biggest brush, after I cleaned my wheels for the first time using them, I noticed a big rectangular gap in the middle of the brush, almost like the bristles had fallen out.  Please see photo as well.  I didn't notice any bristles in my wash bucket, so was the brush just made like this?  No bristles in the middle?  Or did they actually fall out?  Either way, I'm confused and disappointed about this as well.To the seller, HomeChic, can you provide some comments to this?

My trusty ol' Mity Mite has been (and still is) a great charger.  However, I wanted to give modern technology a chance to help me maintain the numerous batteries I'm using (boat, field charger, cars, etc.).  I've used this new charger for a day on three batteries.  It seems to do it's job but only time will tell.Pros: - Compact & lightweight.  Easy to store. - Long cords. - 12 amp charge is good for most automobile charging needs. - Computer controlled charging for better maintenance.Cons: - Buttons are small and cheap.  Have a feeling one or both will fail within a few years. - Wish it had a "START" button. - Not keen on pressing a button to get the status information.  The readout should stay on or cycle every 20-30 seconds.  IMHO

I was excited to receive this driver set as I have previously rented a set and thought for the price, it would be worth owning.  Unfortunately I we very disappointed in this set.  The case is very cheaply made.  It does not hold the drivers with any amount friction and I doubt the hinge would last very long.  But most importantly, the angle of the taper on the two drivers I needed the most is way off.  They are pretty common races that I am installing too.  Nothing exotic, just older Chevy front rotor races.  They did not even come close to sitting on the face of the race as you can see in my pictures.  I guess I'll go back to renting a set from the local parts store or save a little more money for good set.  Also, the included shoulder bolt that is supposed to the hold the driver together doesn't seat all the way.  There just isn't anything good to say about this set.  I'd save your money and get a better set.

2-year update: I'm a couple of months shy of 2 years of use, and this cover has finally started to fail. The black had faded to gray long ago, and now the cloth is starting to fail, developing 'cracks' where you can easily poke your finger through. (I guess 2 years is decent, whereas the thin silver ones only lasted me about 9 months.) I'm adding a photo of the faded/cracked cover...------------------I'm using this cover on a ~large scooter. It seems to be fairly waterproof, but that's the only thing I like about it.The elastic around the bottom is way too tight/strong, and it "bunches up" very tightly around the bike, making it difficult to get this cover on, and even more difficult to get it off (compared to the other covers I've had). Also, when it bunches up the bottom, it bunches up so much that it actually forms a "cup shaped" area that catches water when it rains (which then dumps on your bike when you take the cover off - kinda the opposite of having a dry bike to sit on!)Also, the seams are all taped with some kind of plastic/rubber tape on the inside ... but this tape started coming off after a few weeks, and then these loops of 1/2-off tape on the inside get snagged on the mirrors/handlebars/etc when you try to take the cover off. Very annoying.I ended up cutting the elastic band (so the bottom doesn't have any elastic stretch now), and removed the seam-tape (perhaps my seams aren't waterproof now?) ... this defeats some of the features of the cover, but it sure is less frustrating that the way it came from the factory.

This system is rock solid. Most Jeepers already know if this. It is expensive but worth it. Installation is a breeze if you are mechanically inclined and have some tools.

I love these mirrors. Great price. I have not been on the highway yet. Im living in the Sierras For the summer and put them on my 92 YJ with steel half doors. Great visibility and look great. They can fold in if its really a tight spot and right back to the same location without the hassle.

This LED light set is not 16 watts, it is 12 watts as another mentioned. But it is well built. Note the 12 watt label over the box label on the picture.

UPDATE:I have used this a LOT now, I have jumped at least 20 cars and each time it has worked with no issue, it is hard to beleive that this fairly small box will jump so many cars. I have jumped 3 cars in a row and seen it go from 100% to 95%! This thing is awesome!Call me a skeptic, but I never really imagined that something like this was capable of jumping a car! It is. I used it to jump my ex's toyota sienna minivan after the kids left the dome lights on for the weekend. This thing is actually a really good portable charger for phones too. I charged a galaxy note 4 and a iphone 6, and they filled up quickly, and with little to no heat on anything. To me, this shows that it is quality since heat is wasted energy. In a nutshell, no real heat being made means that it is efficient. The LED on this is a lot brighter than I would have expected, most of these devices have an "emergency light" that is only really useful for a last resort, not the case on this one! Speaking of cases, the included one is awesome. It fits everything needed to keep charging phones, jumping cars batteries, and the device itself. The case is very high quality and is not made from the easy to scratch materials, it is very durable with very thick and protective walls. I pay attention to stuff like this because it means that it will remain unharmed and in good condition. The charger on it is very specific, but they include one, and honestly that was my expectation for a device like this. They all have the barrel style chargers to charge the "jump starter", the big plus here is that the wall plug is significantly smaller in size than the other jumpers I have seen and tried. It also includes a charger if you wanted to keep it hooked up in your car, so it always has enough juice to keep it ready. The pack also has a screen on it that tells you the percentage of the battery charge. Basically they state over 50% will jump start a car, I think it may go lower in a pinch but I have had to find out yet. I do prefer using this to jumper cables, because my cables have become so dirty after only a few uses and are very hard to put back in the pouch when cold. This fairly small box makes it easy for me to be the only one having to hook something up, and makes me feel better that I do not have to use my car to jump someones else's. I mention this because on two separate occasions I have had people that "know what they are doing" hook up one of the cables in reverse. There was a bit of sparks and smoking. I have almost completely freaked out on those two separate coworkers. Considering that a quality pair of jumper cables costs $50, paying twice that for something that is safer, easier to not mess up, and has other uses makes me feel a lot better. I was offered a sample for an honest review of this.Also if you don't know Anker has a 18 month warranty on their products, and this one is no exception. Peace of mind for a bit more money and a 1.5 years of coverage, is a great value.

It looks good. When it is first applied its pretty bright red but as it dries it darkens.  It's not an exact match since my Jeep is a 99 and the paint faded over 16 years. But none the less, It looks good. You Can barely tell a difference between the wheels and body. (painted the wheels)

Work great. Not as bright as I was expecting, but still do the job. I have all 4 in my grill of the RZR. It lights up nice. It is difficult to see during the day. But dusk till dawn it looks GREAT! The rear tape didn't hold up well. I added clear packing tape to help hold them in position. I have gone on 4 rides with no problems.

I got this because my battery kept dying on me.  I think I found the source of the problem after I ordered it but this thing will make sure my battery is kept at full charge.  It comes with 0-ring terminals and alligator clips.  The alligator clips are very easy to put on the terminals.  I read somewhere that the 0-rings are for motorcycles and lawn mowers and stuff so I will just keep them for that.  Anyways, I used regular jumper cables to give my battery enough juice to start my car.  No where in the instructions does it say if the vehicle should be on or off while charging.  My best guess was off since it takes almost 2 days for a complete charge and who leaves their car on for that long, and plus you can charge it with the battery out of the car.  So anyways, I made that little charge for my battery to get up and running and disconnected the jumper cables.  This next part is very important.  First you should connect the alligator cables to the quick connect ends on the battery charger.  Then put the alligator clips on the car positive/negetive leads.  Then if you used an extension cord like I did, plug that into a socket.  Now line up the charger end with the extension cord end.  Make sure all your connections are well on, and then connect the extension cord to the battery charger.  If all goes well, like it did with mine, the red light should come on and say Charging.  I read somewhere that if both the green/red lights STAY on, that your battery is completely dead and that you should disconnect the battery right away or it could lead to bad damage.  The red/green lights flash at startup but then it turned to red.  So anyways, now I am waiting for the complete charge to fill up my battery.  It is 3pm now on a Thursday and I will fill in this space with when it completed.  Keep in mind the instructions say to keep this charger as far away from the battery as possible while charging.  I have mine on the ground right in front of the car so that should work just fine.  I wouldn't recommend putting it inside the engine anywhere like the instructions say.  All in all, for the money of this thing, it is definately worth having around.  I wish I knew about this when I had my motorcycle, because that thing died on me every other day and the quick connect on this would have made charging that thing a breeze.  Also with a riding mower that won't start.  I might get a socket end for the cord so it can charge while in the car.  Other people have said this in their reviews and I will see what it's all about.  Good luck charging!Edit:  So the cigarette adapter just makes hooking it up easier, but it still needs to be connected to a DC outlet so I will pass on that.  Also, I found out that the unit gets very very hot.  I had it on for like 4 hours and touched it and it almost burned me.  Being close to 90 degrees outside couldn't have helped much either, but just be careful.Edit:  So my battery is fully charged now.  It took about a day to charge the whole thing.  Not bad for a device of this size to charge a full battery that was dead at once.  Very good item, I highly recommend it.

I installed these in my truck and I have a tinted windshield and even with that these lights are still bright. I've since put these in several different vehicles. Various bulb sizes. They have been good so far in the past year in my truck. And all the other sets I've got for people they haven't had any problems. Very good product for the price.

See the comparison of photos of this LED and the OEM incandescent 1156. These seem a little brighter to me than the original bulbs, and clearly they are white, not yellow in output as the OEM. I would say the primary benefit of these LEDs is that the light cast is far more even than the OEMs, which means you can see more real detail, instead of some ghost characteristics of the filament. And I would hope these last much longer than the bulbs, they definitely stay a lot cooler than the bulbs. If these don't hold up in use, I'll write a follow up to the review, since I've only used them for about 15 minutes at night so far.

Fantastic lights... Glad I waited for the newest model J version.  These go great with the matching JW Speaker fog lamps.Cons:-Didn't work with my euro headlamp guards, due to a slightly larger 'done' on the lamp.-highly recommend purchasing the OE/Jeep horizontal beam adjuster screws to replace the 'non-adjustable' ones that come with the factory halogens. (Cheap part at the dealer).. But allows for full/proper beam alignment (prevents the 'spotlight' effect).

Lights work very well! Theyre not yet fully adjusted so well see how they do although they look great and work well so far. I proactively tightened the front screws to reduce potential condensation concerns and only a few could be tightened although not much. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that Im sure they didn't use stainless bolts/nuts so Ill make a trip to Home Depot later. (Rather pay $2-3 more to have it in the first place.) Ill update later.

I have not tried my sunglasses with it yet. That said it fits wonderfully and seems like it will make my half helmet riding season last a bit longer before I have to do the winter full helmet. I got this at the same time as the half mask so I would have options. But as comfy as they both are i guess the weather will make my choices for me. If it's a chaps kinda day I will probably go with this over the half I also got from ZANheadgear.

The hitch was fairly simple to install. It took me and my friend about 30 minutes with the hardest part being the fishing through process of the two bolts through the frame. Using a pair of tweezers helped pull the fishing wire through the hole. Enlarging the hole in the frame was straight forward with a drill bit made for steel. I would recommend covering up the enlarged holes with some spray paint afterwards to protect it from rust.  All of the bolts and holes lined up perfectly! The hitch is solidly built with quality welding points, nice paint job, and very sturdy.We will be using the hitch to tow bikes with our Kuat Sherpa bike mount on a 2010 Mazda5. All in all, this is a great hitch that's low profile, easy to install, and does what it's supposed to.

I installed them on my Craftsman mower (headlight bulbs)...definitely a very noticeable upgrade in the lighting---when compared to the old 'factory' 1156 bulbs. (One shouldn't look at these bulbs directly when they're switched on at night---they're really that bright.) See photos included in this review. I would not have added the LED spotlights on the hood of my mower if I had seen these bulbs first...they're easily 4-5 times brighter than the old (factory) bulbs. The packaging was very impressive---great quality bulbs!I would recommend these lights to anyone. BTW---I plan to order more for my son's mower and will also replace the std bulbs on my Impala SS (taillight) This LED bulb is much cheaper than buying an LED taillight for your car.

I just installed these in my 1997 TJ, took about 10 minutes.  I purchased these with apprehension because they are expensive and I was concerned with the mounting points not being sturdy enough.  Also, I am extremely picky about what parts/accessories go on my Jeep.  I am happy to say the grabars feel tight and secure.  They support my 190lbs no problem.  I definitely won't worry about them dry rotting and breaking like the synthetic velcro'd roll bar handles previously installed.  These grabars are simply designed and made with quality materials IN THE USA.  Love em.  Well worth the price payed.  I would buy them again.  I plan on getting the boot bars next.  Thank you for manufacturing a excellent  product in the USA.

I used a pair of these in my gaslight conversion project (see my posted picture up top).  I gutted the gas fixture of my lamp post and then installed a Charmlite copper dual bulb stem which takes automotive 1156 bulbs.  I have bought from LEDwholesalers before and find their products to be excellent.  This one is no different.  Love that it has a range of operating voltage and is AC/DC--you can't get any more foolproof than that.  These bulbs are "warm white" but not that warm.  I would say they are white with a hint of warm coloration.  In any case, they worked well and I am very pleased with the purchase.Update:  So after about 6 months of running these 10 hours a day at night as part of my 12V landscape lighting, I noticed some of the LEDs were burnt out.  With most of the ones left, they are still pretty bright, but I think I will have to be replacing these with less than a year on the clock.  All things considered, I still think these are a good buy since they still last longer than regular bulbs and save quite a bit of money in electricity.

I installed the grill mesh covers on my JK Jeep Sport, fit right in and they look great. I deducted two stars because of the adhesive tape that comes on it, and that they're overly curved. IMO the tape should be just a few millimeters thicker for better adhesion. The curvature as they come in the package is too much for my flat Jeep grill. What I did was, I heated them up with my heat gun to a point where I could straighten them to fit my flat grill openings, so this took the additional time to otherwise quickly fit them in the grill openings. I don't know why they are so overtly curved, I thought all jeeps have a flat grill or maybe this set aren't the right ones to have bought for my JK. On a further note, I like the fact that the grill inserts are now protecting my radiator and that's comforting. I hope they don't start popping off the grill because of the tape adhesion, I've had them on for less than a month, I guess that remains to be seen. I'm contemplating on removing them and finding a thicker industrial tape. All in All they are a great addition.

Ok these are auxbeams 6 x 3 watt cree leds all tested good out of box. Appears to have a soft mount like I've else where here on amazon I would upgrade the 4 little washers that attached the the light it self so not to press them through the thin mount. They seem to very bright for there size and with the price at 17.99 for two ya can't beat that. Ill be using these as rock lights under my truck @ 9.00 a piece  there 11.00 dallors cheaper then the real rock lights and you get 2  plus twice the brightness and can swivel to be aimed unlike rock lights. They run off a 9volt battery too lol so im sure they will last days off a 1200 cold craking 12 volt battery with the engine off.

There are many cheaper viable competitors to Dynamat Xtreme that have been available for a long time. Google search "Dynamat alternative". You can literally spend hours upon hours reading posts where people argue which works the best.  I decided to go with Dynamat Xtreme based on the mostly positive reviews I've found and have used it to dampen the doors of my past two vehicles (1999 Ford Ranger and currently 2011 Honda CR-V).  It works really well at dampening vibrations and improves the bass response by effectively sealing the large openings found in the metal door panels.  One layer usually does the job but I use two layers directly around the speaker openings since this is where vibrations occur the most. See the pictures I uploaded of the Dynamat-treated doors of my CR-V.Here are some tips to install Dynamat on the doors...-Make a template by taping wrapping paper to the door and trim it to fit the area you want to cover with Dynamat. Use this template to precut the Dynamat sheets before applying to door. Flip the templates over and use it to cut the sheets for the other door (since they are mirror images).- Cut slits and holes in Dynamat to pass the door wires/cables/brackets before applying Dynamat. Apply the Dynamat section on one end and slowly work to the other end, peeling off the paper backing a little bit at a time. Dynamat is super sticky and won't come off once applied.- Seal any holes with small cut pieces of Dynamat. You want to make the door as airtight as possible.I actually have used the Dynamat for other applications as well.  I lined the inside of my Sony Blu-ray player which greatly reduced the transport noise I was hearing from it.  I also used it to mass dampen my CD player which hypothetically improves sound quality by reducing unwanted vibrations.  I also applied a small piece to the back of the transducers of entry-level Grado headphones.As alluded to above, the most common complaint with Dynamat is its high price.  Actually, if you compare the price per square foot, Dynamat Xtreme is not that much more expensive and is even cheaper than some other sound damping materials on the market (e.g. second skin audio, fatmat, b-quiet). Amazon's prices for Dynamat Xtreme is pretty good ($50 shipped for a door kit).

Bought this to replace non-functioning awning motor on my 2016 Crossroads Cruiser 5th wheel. The original part number of the one I removed was 373566. With the exception of having to add the polarized connector it was physically a complete match. Both were 12VDC, 75 RPM. The original had a P/N 591-70B on the side as well as the Lippert 373566 number. The 266148 has a P/N 591-70 without the B. Also a newer production date. Not sure the difference other than it was more than 1/2 the cost than the direct replacement from the RV dealer. I greased the exposed gears, bolted it on, plugged it in and Bob's your uncle, awning is working again. Hoping to get the original replaced on warranty, but seeing that it died in less than a year, it can't hurt to have an extra on hand. Awnings are useless without the motor. Disclaimer: I am a consumer, this is my experience and opinion. Using a different part number could void any warranties, so proceed at your own risk.

I've been very happy with this cargo carrier. It's Stout and assembly was easy.I DO RECOMMEND this Curt Cargo Carrier.I roadtrip all over the country, to Mountain Bike and Camp, that's my hobby. I wanted something to haul extra cargo and even a generator when I'm really going deep. This works great and when not in use, you can, if need be disassembled it and store in the vehicle. I've driven about 2000, mostly highway miles loaded with a Honda 3500 Generator and a Chainsaw, and it performed flawlessly. I bottomed it out, driving slowly, several times in the woods and expected it to be damaged, but it wasn't. Initial assembly was pretty easy, even with the so-so instructions. There are 2 types of bolts and each bolt type only fits the hole it's meant for. The center shank, which if the main support for the whole carrier does go a certain way, just look it over and you'll see. I didn't know this and so I didn't check, which meant about 2/3 of the way through, I found out and had to pull if apart and start over, which took all of 10 minutes. I used an electric impact driver, but a regular drill or even hand tools would have worked fine. Don't cinch any bolt down until it's all together, that way you have some play to get every thing in place. Once it all loosely assembled you can go around and tighten it up. I hope this review helps.

Instructions  were confusing at first.  Said it fit 2005-2009 Tacoma with V6, but after examining parts, it also fits 2011. Installed the intake and throttle body spacer in about 1 1/2 hours. First test drive and I was impressed. Better acceleration, very noticeable at high rpm. I can feel a tad more power and a very throaty sound. At cruising speed, not noticeable, but stomp it, and you can tell there's a difference in your truck. So far I am satisfied 100%.

Great for regular maintenance but if your chain is really gunned up, regular Kerosene works the best. I used almost the whole bottle of cleaner in this one use. After the Kerosene my chain looked as shiny and silver as my sprocket. I neglected to take a photo before applying the MPPL and WAX, but I did take a pic after applying the last two sprays.  OH WHAT A DIFFERENCE! Love the Wax. I may just buy the WAX by itself next time.

I purchased this muffler in May 2015, now less than 2 1/2 years later it has holes rusted though it and it is getting loud.  Yes, it has a lifetime warranty however you must sent the old muffler back to the retailer that you purchased if from or Tenneco in Monroe, MI.  The warranty is for a replacement unit...  I kind of need a muffler to drive the vehicle!To put things into perspective, this muffler replaced an 18 year old Mopar OEM muffler, yes the original!  Walker claims their Stainless Steel mufflers have "3X the life expectancy vs. typical aluminized mufflers".  Lets do some quick math, 30 (months that I had it) divided by 3 equals 10.  So walker is claiming other mufflers only last 10 months?  Wow!I have never seen stainless steel rust out so quickly.

For the price this seems to be a descent tool. Not something I use all the time, but good to have in the shop. I needed it to remove a bearing from a shaft, but if could come in handy for a number of applications. Satisfied

These are so freaking awesome!! I got the flood lights for my fog lights replacement on my 03 Rubicon. I angled them down to not blind other drivers on the road and they are amazing!! Have taken them off road, driving down the street and up in Snoqualmie Pass and HWY 97 heading towards Leavenworth. These lights literally light up everything. I almost don't need headlights with these they are so bright. I have the LED headlight conversion and these go together perfectly.The spill out to the sides is incredible, literally driving with a wall of light down the road.Will get some good pictures of what the lights look like when they are on soon.

First off be safe, use a good respirator.  Wear eye protection. Cover your skin and change clothes right afterwards.  This stuff is pretty nasty on your lungs.  It contains a harmful chemical. Read the label and know what you are getting into.  A little white paper filter mask isn't going to cut it.  My rule of thumb is that if you can smell it, it is getting in your lungs.  I used a Gerson One Step mask but I'm not sure that is what they are suggesting in their warnings.  (I couldn't smell it wearing the mask)That being said, I was able to get a professional quality clear coat out of the can.  I painted the outside of a tailgate for an old Dodge Ram.  The picture doesn't really do it justice.  I put on 2 coats and had a little bit left.  I have a tendency to put it on a little thicker than I should.  You get a red 'key' type device that comes in the top of the cover that releases the hardener.  Shake it for several minutes then remove the key from the cap and turn the can upside down.  You gently press it into a nozzle on the bottom on the can and shake again for a couple of minutes.  You should briefly hear the hardener release when you press in the red key. Shake frequently as you spray as well.Once you activate the can you have about 24 hours to use it.  Dispose of the can properly.  The drying time was pretty quick.  The time between coats depends on the outside temperature.  (about 8 minutes in my case)  I was able to wet sand the orange peel about 48 hours after I had applied it.  I may have been able to sand it earlier but I waited 48 hours due to the fact that I tend to spray heavier coats than I probably should.  I probably should have put on 2 cans.  The way I would do it would be to spray one can, let dry, sand off orange peel, apply the second coat and sand off the orange peel again.I have used other clears.  This one is top notch.  Also the spray pattern from the nozzle is very nice and easy to deal with.  (nice vertical pattern)  It is about the best pattern I have seen from a rattle can.  I will use this on all of my future projects that I want to shine like factory clear. Amazon has a great price compared to my local auto body supply store.  I paid $27 a can at the local store.Originally I had tried the Duplicolor acrylic clear which had a decent spray pattern as well but it didn't get hard enough for my tastes and didn't shine anywhere near as much as this 2k 'Glamour' High Gloss paint does.  Even after sanding off the orange peel, it wasn't as shiny as the rest of the truck.  I sanded most of the Duplicolor off and put this 2K on top.  My guess is that as long as you clean and sand the surface and you are putting on something with more shine than the layer below it will stick.  That isn't always true though, some products will react or melt the layer below.  I was lucky and that didn't happen in my case.I'm not a pro painter, in fact I've only painted parts of cars a few times. I watched some youtube videos and got some advice from professional painters over the years.

Great Product! It feels great, bonds to metal with no issue, quick delivery, and of course amazing price!! I've now had it on a light bar bracket on the roof of my truck for a year and it hasn't faded or moved at all. I just wanted to update my review so people know it will not only look good initially but it will hold up in the harshest of conditions.

Bought these for my knock around KLR I keep up in Oregon.  I purchased them to keep basic tools, tire repair, overnight and survival gear in. They have held up well for the last 1 1/2 yrs having banged around a lot of dirt backroads.  No problems yet with low speed tip-overs. The yellow fades a bit but I have noticed that with all Hi-Viz stuff I purchase.  As others have noted, these are not quick on/off and are a bit fiddly to get hooked up.  Once set up they are pretty solid. My KLR has the Happy-Trail OSR luggage racks installed and, as also noted by others, it is a good idea to have some kind of system to keep the bags off the exhaust.  Given their price I would recommend these.  Ortliebs may be nicer but are almost 3 x the cost.

These LED's are a great value and definitely worth getting. I installed these on my 2017 Volkswagen Jetta without coming across any issues such as Error indicators on my dash. These are so much brighter than the dim OEM halogen bulbs which were previously installed. These make backing up at night a lot easier, especially when utilizing the back up camera in my car as well. These also make your car stand out to others as a safety precaution. Definitely recommend.

Purchased this product for my LED Light Bar Nilight 42 Inch 240W LED LightBar and it almost started an electrical fire. The wires just before the relay melted together and started smoking. Luckily the fuse blew and didn't cause further damage to the rest of my vehicle. The cords got insanely hot right before the cords fused together. The lightbar is a 240w lightbar, this product says it's rated for 300w. That is tota BS. Since I am past my return date, I am now out $17. I'm glad that's all it did. Do not buy this product expecting it to do what it says it will do. Unless you want to watch your vehicle burn up on the side of the road.

I own a detail shop. I have tried many products over the years and have found the polymer products work the best. I use Zaino as my main finish protectant. But did give NXT Tech Wax a try. I always try new products on my own cars before any customers. I waxed both my 2004 auto's in the same weekend, 1 with Zaino's and the other with NXT Tech Wax.  As far as I can see the NXT went on and off as easy, left as deep a shine and seems to stand up to the eliments just as well as the Zaino's. With the only real difference being price I'll be using the NXT Tech wax from now on.

Works like a champ for my off-grid box!!Drill hole was done with a 1 1/8" hole saw - a VERY tight fit, but, they do fit through nicely.One odd little quirk was that the volt-meter only has about 1/2" of thread depth, and since these are mounted in 1/2" plywood, I did have to do a countersunk hole on the back side (1 1/2") to allow the nut to secure the meter.

They don't fit flush against your face so they will not keep wind and dirt out of your eyes. There's a big gap in between the frame and the face. If you're looking for a quality pair of frames, These aint it. I tried to bend them to the proper fit, I could have snapped them.

I was looking for an alternative option to the plastic dipstick on my 2013 Honda Rebel. Not only does the magnetic dipstick looks amazing, it actually works. After 30 miles on a fresh oil change, the tip actually had black shavings of metal. The fit, finish and quality is second to none... Highly recommended.

I used this with the DUSICHIN SFL-001 foam cannon and it creates ALOT of foam, I am still playing with the ratios to get the perfect thickened I want, because I want it to be thicker so the foam does not slide off the car. But I love the Mr. pink solution. I would suggest buying the gallon size because you have to use 2 ounces in the foam cannon each use and you want it to last a long time. 5 stars!!

I cannot rave enough about this product!  Just make sure your car is washed and is dry.  I spray a 2 ft by 2 ft area.  Spray on and wipe off promptly.  Like other reviews, if you really let it dry, it is harder to wipe this Net Shield into your paint.  Just keep wiping until you feel a deep smooth on your paint.  People have complained about your paint not feeling as slick as other waxes and sealants.  It feels, to me, like a deeper shine slickness.  After spraying on, just keeping wiping with clean micro fiber cloth until the area starts feeling like a rich, deep, silky shine.  Just nice, smooth strokes. My car and bike get this rich, deep mirror like finish.  This is the best wax/sealant I have ever used.  I don't feel the need to put wax on after I use this.  It makes your paint look like a deep, silky beauty!  My black bike looks so shiny and mirror like.  Remember it will feel more like you might think it feels like when you  have a wax/sealant that protects more and give your paint a deeper shine. I don't want people to put their hands on my freshly wax/sealant car/motorcycle anyway.... lol.  Other waxes/sealants might give you that fast slick feeling, Sonax Polyner Net Shield gives you a beautiful deep silky feeling.  Outstanding.  Look at all the 5 star reviews.

First off.. I ordered "silver ceramic coated finish" which is a thick glossy heat treated finish which is seen in the photos.. what I received was a header that looked like it was hand painted with a rattle can of Krylon silver paint.. scratches all over and not anything close to the picture on here..The paint burned off in a matter of minutes.Second.. this is a pretty poor fit... which I assumed would be an issue to some extent but this was pretty bad.. eventually my mechanic was able to come up with a solution but really things should just fit..I'm mostly upset that I received an item that was falsely advertised as ceramic treated and received an item that even possibly counterfeit.Shipping was slow too.I would say spend more and look elsewhere.

Purchased this film to wrap some chrome trim inside my Murano. After watching some YouTube vids, installation was quiet easy. The film does have some stretch to it but one must be careful with just how much they stretch it. Make sure to stretch it with the "grain" otherwise the brushed finishes will not look right.During this hot summer I noticed that in some spots the film had started to rise. Not sure if the heat had affected the glue somehow. I plan to redo the work in the upcoming months.

okay here is my experience with a steering stablizer.I bought this brand because I have a Rubicon Express lift and want all my suspension component to match.The reason I bought this was that after adding a 2.75 inch lift to my 2012 JKU and 315 tires, the steering was generally solid, no wobbles no squirrlyness. BUT at highway speed the steering had some play, and was sensitive.I wanted to tighten this up some....so I added a steering stabilzer shock (I just replaced the stock Jeep shock with the RubiconExpress shock)This RubiconExpress shock was TIGHT at first, upon initial test drive the steering would not return to center perfectly. you had to guide it back to the center after making a 90 turn. At first i was like "well dang, this sucks" but then I took it out on the highway and the steering felt tighter, no longer wandered. I only have 45k miles on the jeep itself and do not go offroad so my suspension components are not worn out. as others have mentioned about wandering jeeps. My shocks and springs are brand new and professionally install and aligned by Jeep.This tighness went away and is not that noticeable after about 1000 miles. The shock has 2500 miles now it now and feels great, the Jeep rides great and I am pleased.Mine arrived with a bunch of brackets (no re-location bracket for a 2012) a boot, and a sticker and is black in color.took 20 minutes to install and does not require jacking up the jeep.easiest mod ever.

No star if I can! Like other reviewers stated. This filter leaks around the gasket area even after tightened( more than 3/4 turn). Something is definitely wrong with the redesign. I'm returning it! See attached picture. Original factory has a concave design where Purolator PL14612 is opposite!

Purchased two of these for two different go carts.  These are awesome.  There is a video on a website that shows installation instructions.  I installed both and brought the go carts back to life.  No more burning up clutches.  The torque that they have is amazing.  Climb steep inclines, pick up speed, run through thick grass, they do it all.  I will be buying another for a minibike as well.

Starting to get weary about smells even with the deodorizer included. Lost a star. Very compact for storage. Yet, toilet bowl and seat are almost the size of a traditional toilet. I bought the smaller sized option as I needed it to be able to slide under my motorhome bunk for storage. This option makes the toilet low to the ground (around 12.5") as opposed to the larger and taller version of this model which is identical in design besides that it is taller and has a larger tank capacity. This toilet has many great features. Making the choice to purchase the premium model (or deluxe in some countries) is a very wise decision. Camco decided to eliminate the problematic flush system that several other models still use. The system I am referring to is a bellows/accordian style pump mechanism that with normal wear and tear or any puncture of the mechanism would render the unit nearly unusable due to the toilet spraying water from the bellows system once a fault occurred. This resulted in many water damaged campers and I am glad they implemented a rod style pump mechanism which is smooth and durable, unlike the previously mentioned design. I use this toilet as my primary commode in my RV. As a single person using this toilet every day it only needs to be emptied about every ten days. It seals very very well. Even on sharp corners and steep grades, including rapid braking I have never experienced a drop of water leaked from anywhere on this toilet. Remember when purchasing to definitely upgrade to the deluxe or premium model in the drop down menu. It's only a few dollars more but will pay off in the long run. The only reason I can justify purchasing the standard model is if you have space limitations or an area that requires a perfect square footprint as opposed to a oblong shape that the premium design has (to mimic a standard toilet design) The triple valve flush does a great job at washing the sides and creases of the bowl to prevent dry urine or feces buildup  in the bowl. It also has a locking lid and separate seat hinge so the seat can be raised for male urination and lowered for female urination or for a bowel movement. As an opioid treated person passing large hard stools this unit flushes and empties with ease. I believe it's lower design helps constipated individuals align their colon properly for a smooth "go". In Asia they sell devices to bring your feet higher to position your bowel into a almost squatting style position. It has proven to help with difficult bowel movements by properly aligning due to its very low level position for the seat. This may, however be problematic for those who are unable or have difficulty  getting up from low seating positions. To remedy this issue, install a wall mounted handle to grip to help you up. I am unsure if a handicapped "seat riser" is able to be fitted with this toilet, as I haven't tried one on it yet. In conclusion, this is a toilet that is well worth $150-$200 but again, it's available as of now (4/1/2018) for prime members at a fantastic price. Packaging was well padded and protected. Item arrived in OEM box clearly labeled as "Travel Toilet". If this for some reason is embarrassing or being given given as a gift, you have an option for Amazon to package the toilet discreetly.Update; smelling more and more even though the valve is closed.*PRO TIP: TO USE.......OPEN SLIDE VALVE, URINATE OR MAKE BOWEL MOVEMENT, CLOSE LID BUT KEEP SLIDE VALVE OPEN, THEN PUMP TO FLUSH, FINALLY CLOSE VALVE FULLY.*WARNING! DO NOT USE TO THE POINT WHERE THE WASTE TANK IS ALMOST FULL! THIS IS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO OCCUR IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS. "SPLASH BACK" IS DUE TO NO VENTING AVAILABLE LIKE A STANDARD RV TOILET HAS. YOU CANNOT VENT A PORTABLE TOILET BECAUSE IT WOULD NEED A ROOF VENT OR OTHER EXHAUST FAN, ETC. IT WILL SPLASH BACK WASTE DEBRIS WHEN CLOSING OR OPENING THE SLIDE VALVE IF YOU LET IT GET TOO FULL. TRUST ME YOU DON'T WANT IT TO SPLASH BACK. SO YOU WILL AVOID THIS BY EMPTYING AT NO MORE THAN 80% OF TANK CAPACITY.THATS THE EASY FIX TO A REPULSIVE SPLASH BACK.TIP #3:USE TWO OR THREE "TOSS INS" DEODORIZER PACKS AS ONE WILL NOT CUT THE SMELL, EVEN IF YOU KEEP IT NICE AND CLEAN. ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE GOING #2 IN THIS UNIT AND USING IN AN RV LIKE I AM DOING. TRUST ME JUST USE AN EXTRA PACK OR TWO, UNLESS THE TOILET IS BEING USED *AND* STORED OUTDOORS.HOPE THIS HELPS! ENJOY THE. NICE OVAL TOILET DESIGN. THIS SURE BEATS OUT THOSE SQUARE UNITS.  ITS BEEN A VERY NICE ADDITION TO MY RV.

Emgo 20-64580 Universal R or L motorcycle mirror for $12.40 with Prime.  The exact same product as the Bike Master Version for almost 50% less.  I'm running a pair of these on a KTM 950 adventure so I can fold them out of the way when I hit the dirt (and avoid breaking my master cylinder in a tip over).  Although stock mirrors are usually better than aftermarket, especially at this price point, these are great! They have less vibration than STOCK!  This mirror has flat glass but I already had one identical mirror that came with convex glass, maybe the Bike Master version is convex? I've taken photos of both so you can see the difference.  (I'm ok with this though, I like having one of each)&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Emgo-20-64580-Black-Left-Right-Side-Replacement-Mirror-for-Enduro/dp/B002305A1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Emgo 20-64580 Black Left/Right Side Replacement Mirror for Enduro</a>You've got to be careful tightening the screws that retain the mirror to the post, careful not to overtighten and strip them, but that's the only weak point and just common sense.  I'm super happy with these and think they're well worth the money.

Started using this stuff every few months as a preventative measure, didn't have corrosion problems previously. Suddenly started having crazy corrosion problems every few months. Eventually my negative terminal rusted so badly from this stuff it broke in two, copper positive terminal covered in Blu-green buildup. Always followed the instructions and washed it off and dryed. I'm guessing this is why it's only available via third party sellers...

Had this top since August of 2017. So far there have been no problems with the top. It went on easily, even with limited instructions. The strap that wraps around the rear seat belt anchor in the roll bar was a bit tricky to get installed correctly but, after watching the video a few times, I was able to route it correctly. The windows are quick to take off and put back on. I love the storage area in the top for the windows! The sewing is done with heavy thread and the zippers are good quality as well. The Velcro is very strong. Rear visiblity is improved tremendously. There are a few drawhacks. First, the top is not designed to be taken down completely without removing it and the door surrounds from the jeep completely. If someone knows a way to secure the top and surrounds, please post it. There are a few points where the top is stretched very tight. There are protectors in tosr spots but still a concern. I will update if anything changes. Great to, great price.

The bag is nice and soft leather, and includes a rain cover.  Because I'm going on a trip next week, I packed the bag with what I thought I would bring, and there was quite a bit of room left over.  To give you an idea: 5 shirts, 2 sweatshirts, 5 socks and underwear, toiletries, 3 pairs of jeans, laptop computer, Digital camera and filters/gear, rain suit, and second helmet visor to swap out.  And I didn't even touch the small second bag on the top or the pockets on the side; this was all just in the main bag.My sissy bar does not have a backrest pad (since I don't have a passenger seat, and only plan on using it for luggage), and the strap design allowed me to tighten the bag on the bare backrest just fine.  After strapping it down, I pushed an pulled on the bag, and it barely moved.One small thing: when tightening the straps, I had to hold the opposing strap as well, otherwise the opposing strap loosened.  Only happened when I was tightening the straps.  After they were tight, pushing and pulling did not loosen anything, but it took a moment to get used to the mechanism.--UPDATE--So I took this bag on my trip, and I still do love it, but I needed to drop the rating.  If I could give it a 3.5, I would, but unfortunately, I can only give a 3 or a 4.The trip was 1340 miles, and after about 200 miles, the straps started loosening, and wouldn't tighten to the point where the bag didn't move back and forth.  This was quickly resolved with Bungee cords, and everything worked fine after that, but it takes away from the look of the bag when everything is Bungeed down on the bike.  At about 850 miles, the clasp that holds the top bag tore out of the pocket because the stitching came loose.  This meant I needed to Bungee the top bag down as well, which made getting to the camera much harder, and not at all a quick grab like before.Just to be clear, I still very much like the bag and its expandable design, but because I had to pull out the sewing kit to stitch this bag up, and because I need to use Bungee cords to keep it on the bike, I have to drop my rating.

Overall, these floor mats fit very well and seem to be a very durable material. However, they lack a cutout by the throttle pedal that the factory Mazda floor mats have, which prevents full throttle application. I realized this while data logging my Mazdaspeed3 with a Cobb AccessPort module. A section needed to be cut out to fix this, which, given the durable material, could be rather difficult without power tools. I used a Porter Cable osscilating multi-tool, but a Dremel should work too. This might be a Mazdaspeed3 specific issue, but if not, it's a pretty big oversight by WeatherTech.

Good dash kit. Here's the breakdown:Pros:Very versatile, provides you with several installation optionsExtra trim ring included in case you don't like the one that came with your head unitGood color match to the dash.Storage area is a nice sizeCons:It juts out ever so slightly from the original dash. You have to be looking for it, but once you see it, it can't be unseen.Bottom Line: Your options are limited right now for a dash kit for a newer model economy car like the Corolla, so I'd say this is as good as any kit you will find. Yes, it juts out slightly, but no dash kit ever fits exactly perfect. As a side note, the top part is somewhat flexible, and I was able to stick a CD player phone mount in there (see pictures). I'd highly recommend it to a friend and or buy a second one if needed.

Before I installed these, friends and family often complained that it was too hard to get in and out of my Jeep.  Installation takes under 5 minutes and they fit perfectly and look like they came from the factory.Besides making it easier for people to get in the Jeep, I've noticed a lot of passengers like to hold on to them the whole time whenever I drive.  I guess it makes them feel more secure.  Whatever the reason, they're a huge hit.I was sent a sample for review and I was very impressed by how easy they were to install and how useful they are to friends and family.I hope you found this review helpful.  Questions and comments are welcome.

You must be very careful when you buy popular items like this for a good price. After receiving the parts I decided to see if there were any cases of counterfeiting. Sure enough NGK are definitely prime targets. I discovered a telltale sign of fakeness, the positioning of printed information on the white part of the plug - it MUST be centered. Even the photos of the item everywhere online shows it centered no matter where you may look. The ones I received were printed too high and this was specifically mentioned in the warnings from NGK about fakes. So I went to the local auto parts store and asked if I could photograph one and they said sure. It had the printing centered properly. Red flags flying now!I ordered again from a different seller and comprared them upon receipt. The differences were glaring and I am confident that the first order was indeed counterfeit:The boxes had many discrepancies - they were dissimilar in 10 different waysthe sheen of the metal was off as mentioned at NGKthe printing was off center as mentioned at NGKthe nut-part of the body was differentthe plug caps were different color - nickel on the valid ones and more bronze on the fakesYou can judge for yourself with the images I've included. Always be vigilant when it comes to your money and car!

I completely found this on accident, but I'm glad I did.I used a considerable amount of Damplifier Pro in my last car (2010 Kia Forte Koup) a year ago.  It was nearly FOUR TIMES the cost of this Noico deadener for the same 80 mil thickness. ($60 vs. $225 shipped!)  The damplifier worked great, but was harder to shape and apply due to the thicker foil, and my fingers got pretty cut up working with it.  I don't have experience with any other butyl deadeners so this is all I can compare the Noico product to.The Noico deadener works great as well, at the very least not noticeably worse than the Damplifier.  For being 70% cheaper that is a pretty huge endorsement. I immediately noticed it was also much easier to bend and shape.  The material is adhering well to the semi-dirty metal in the doors of my 2012 Mazda3.  I'm doing the last door tonight and the other three make a really great solid "thud" when I knock on them now.  Every time I walk by my car I want to knock on the doors... my fiance is starting to get sick of it!EASILY would and will buy again when I need more deadener.  You just can't beat this price.  FYI, you do NOT need to cover an entire metal panel with this stuff.  This is not meant to act as a sound barrier, only to kill metal panels that resonate.  I'm doing ~50% coverage of my 2012 Mazda3 sedan's doors, trunk and floor and 36 sqft is the perfect amount for that.  The hood and roof are not important.

Run away from any of these products there was nothing wrong with the rear end of my truck other than a damp spot on the rear differential pinion seal which most people would just ignore not me I am all into prevention so like an idiot I put some BlueDevil sealant in as a preventative measure and woke some days later to find every single seal on my differential was gone left wheel shaft seals right hand wheel shaft seals and the differential pinion seal oil was pouring out of all three locations at same time this stuff acts like an acid..... Cost me about $800 total to fix it, not to mention two days off work and cabs back and forth to shop.

This unit is does not charge at 2.1A or at 1A.  It is a low quality piece of junk.It does not have a blue LED as listed, it does not have a LED at all.It does not have any writing on the USB portion.It is not a single threaded socket + a USB socket with two ports as it appears.  It is two 12v sockets plus a generic cigarette adapter with two very low watt ports.

Recreational Vehicle cupboards present a special challenge because they're often in motion.  If those cupboards contain heavy items such as cans and jars, a panic turn, stop or unexpected hump or dip in the road can send the contents flying.  These cupboard bars can be easily adjusted, as the cupboard contents are consumed, to prevent such heavy items from sliding and possibly slamming into the cupboard door and knocking it open.  After I installed these bars in my motorhome cupboards and kept them adjusted, the contents of the cupboards remain where they belong and cannot slide around.  We've experienced no more flying food.  The oak finish on the bars allow them to blend into my RV's decor.

Outstanding! I purchased&nbsp;&nbsp;a year ago and while they were an improvement over the incandescent they just weren't bright enough. Cutequeen's bulb is on the left and JDM ASTAR's bulb is on the right. Clear difference more amazing in person! I changed out all interior bulbs with these LEDs from Cutequeen. I was thinking I was going to have to replace & upgrade the fixtures to get more light. Happy to report that project is no longer on the RV to-do wish list! These bulbs are it! 2 fixtures like the one pictured (4 bulbs total) light up the entire living area of the RV! Couldn't be happier! I've changed out most of my truck's lights to LEDs and these are the highest quality I've gotten. None of them needed wiggling or dielectric grease like many on my truck. Very happy with these. I am sticking with this seller for my future LED lights (the outside RV lights are next on the RV to-do list).

This product is great (as most Chemical Guys products are!).  I apply this either after the paint has been clayed or after a full paint correction, before I apply my sealant or wax.  This leaves the paint feeling amazingly slick and smooth.  It also adds depth and gloss to the finish that is then further enhanced by your sealant or wax of choice.  EZ Creme Glaze also helps to protect your vehicles finish.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to enhance the look and feel of their vehicles paint.  It is a great product that truly works.-Zach[...]

Great Product. Came with the templet which makes lining this up properly a breeze. I watched a video on youtube and had these installed in 10 minutes. Also impressed with the paint match and quality. This was on a 2013 Urban Titanium color. I expect this will help prevent potential door dings.Just an update 6/18 - This has taken several hits from other cars and done its job well. It took a large impact on the passenger side from another car door and did not dent or damage the door itself. Dime size chunk in the trim. The price paid for this has now more than covered the cost of repairs that would have been needed by Dent Wizard had I not installed this trim.

This is exactly as advertised = a 5" diameter bumper sticker.It's not transparent = it is completel6y white on the back side.It isn't suitable for inside vehicle windows but dose look nice on outside of rear window.As far as bumper stickers go = seems to be decant quality = peels off the paper easily.Needs to be applied with care to avoid pesky bubbles.Just applied this to bumper so can't speak for length of time it'll keep good color.But don't for-see any reason it shouldn't last for several years.

never tried it I was always maguiars or armorall so I picked this up with some new tire applicators and honestly I love it this shit is great goes on smooth it's not messy and and it don't fling off at all I put it on light so it has only a semi gloss finish so the tire looks new and semi wet. I love it no more splatter on my paint. I never heard of this brand so I was like ehhhhh I don't know ya know. Dont wanna waste money but I'm very happy with this product

Looks pretty good for a month or two.  The "powder coating" is bubbling and chipping off.  I don't know what the heat rating is on the coating they use but I think I could use a can of high temp generic crap from Walmart that would last longer.  Maybe I just got a bad one, I messaged them so we'll see if they can make it right

I received these pretty quickly. Easy install, just pop it in like a normal bulb. I liked that they included the measurements on amazon so I could measure the space in my dome light before I bought these because they fit perfectly with maybe a mm to spare. I installed these and they aren't much brighter than the standard bulbs. They provide a much cleaner white light though. I wasn't very happy at first that they didn't provide super bright lighting but now I kind of like it. I think I'd be much more comfortable with the somewhat dim white LED lighting than being blinded every time I open my car door. I think for me it gives just enough light. It gives enough to see what you're doing or looking for, but it's not over powering. If you're looking for LED lighting that will light your entire car and that you can see from across the parking lot, these aren't for you.Only concern I have which I don't know if it's these or my car is that when my dome light is switched to door mode, the lighting stays on (but very very dim, almost off) when the door is closed. It's so little light that it's pretty much off, but you can still see a little white glow inside the dome light. I don't think it's a big deal. It's probably my car and I just never noticed before because if I switch it to off it goes off. It's almost non existent, you wouldn't even notice if someone didn't point it out to you. It's not like the light is actually on when the door is closed. The light fades fine when I lock the doors just like the standard lighting faded when going off. Over all, it does what it needs to do. It's not super bright but it provides clean white lighting (better than the original lighting) and I think it's good for the price (You figure you're paying $25 bucks for the same thing at Pep Boys).

I like the look, size, and price of this item. However, it's made of the thinnest metal I've ever seen, the chrome plating begins to chip as soon as you take it out of the package, and the bolts are damn near impossible to get in once you have the pedal attached to the cover. I used double sided 3M tape to get a better seal and it seems strong. The pedal looks great, but I would gladly pay double for one made of thicker metal with a higher quality chrome finish.

One of the base tabs broke off like warm butter and I was only twisting it in with my finger tips.I tried to ask the seller to charge me for 1 replacement bulb, and when I get that replacement bulb, I will return the broken one, but they rather I cut the wire to a working bulb when I'm already using it in my vehicle.  With 1 tab broken, the bulb stays in, but I don't know for how long.

Very Bright. Made a under hood work light by glueing them to a bar and magnets. Used larger wiring and clips to hook to a battery. Use it everyday at the shop. Ordered more to make some more for the guys at work. Just be gentle with the original wires, pretty small...... Update. 22 led went put today on my first set. Already got my secong set made into a shop light bit not buying this brand again.

Used this product on my 87 Corvette today.  Went on easy( bottles warns against using too much at a time) and the included micro-fiber  was handy to apply the wax and buff the car.  Added bonus, this wax does not turn black trim white like other products do.  I'm impressed with the results on 31 year old paint.

Good fit on the Sporster 883. Very powerful light. Not sure what the extra red wire is for (turn lights maybe?), but didn't connect it. Probably for the 2 little triangles on the top part? There's a 3 prong plug which is "plug and play" for all the other lights, low beam, position and high beam.  I gave it 4 stars because there are no instructions or diagrams provided. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars

I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest reviewThe product is light and simple to install. Just toss it on the windshield and closed the two front door to secure the flapper, then its done. Its perfect fit for my RAV4. Consider its a small SUV, I am always going out with lots of sun exposure. A Sun Shade will keep my car cool, and reduce workload on my A/C to cool down. The old style of the sunshade is setup from inside of the car, and most of time, it will become soft and slide out of position.The reflective part is very shining under the sun, under side is plastic liner, with square stitch pattern.

The terminal wire fell out after installing it.  Poor quality.  Added an extra 30 mins to figure out how to crimp the wire correctly with a pair of pilers.  The rest of the installation was OK.  No other issues so far.  I most likely will add some solder to the connections to try to ensure they don't come loose.No way to return this as the old unit was already trash.  Only gave them two stars because the rest of the unit appeared to be OK.  Another reviewer mentioned recycling the old wire but to do this you need to take the whole unit apart and hope you don't break the plastic housing.  tried this with my old unit and the plastic started to break.  Easier to check your wiring connections and return any unit that has bad crimping.

Perfect fit for a 2007 Dodge Ram Hemi!  Be aware that this does not come with the rubber mounting bushings used on the top bolts or rubber bumper standoff on the bottom, but these typically do not wear out.  So make sure you salvage your old ones for this new install.  Overall this is a real easy install for a DIY'r on a Dodge Ram and the price is reasonable.  Don't overpay for a so called premium radiator when in the end you won't notice any difference.  The quality on this one from Sunbelt appears better than OEM, especially around the top of frame.  I'm very happy with this purchase.

Easy install they are a little low and I broke one of the cheap bolts off while installing and didn't even get too much pressure on it so had to remove it thankfully the head broke off and with a new 4Runner the threads easily gave up the bad bolt. I just used one the cap OEM bolts that were on the truck. Seems to work ok will check it later to make sure not lose.

I have read many reviews about this light.  Main reason for purchase was the overall rating.  So far a 3/5 is appropriate.  I had about 8 allen screws that were not totally tight.  I am debating taping it off and sealing it with clear 5200.  I paid less than 140.00 the rough country on sale was 399.  Eurolife has 2 year warranty, rough country has a 3 year warranty.  I purchased an Opt7 wiring harness.  I will installing soon.  I will post pics, this is a 16 birthday project for my sons 2009 Sierra Denali AWD.  This post will have reviews to come:)

Merchandise received is not as advertised, the item is counterfeit, the chrome is rusting away out of the box and the unit packaging show made in Germany which is not! Cheap packaging made in China and this purchase was simply a waste of money. If you want genuine products, try the local Benz dealer. The bolts are not stainless steel to match what is on the car. This item is going to trash!

Alarm seems to be good quality remotes. Easy hook up on the alarm with basic instructions.Both outputs for door switches are negative outputs so to get them to work with a 3 wire door lock you will need 2 Bosch style relays and put power to them in order for it to work. Most other alarms with keyless option use a 200m power wire for both outputs which sends a pulse to the lock for the keyless function. Im planning to return this alarm but only cause i was needing a different setup them what this product offers. For a basic alarm it will work well and serve its purpose. Purchase it if your after just a basic alarm and you will be fine

Great, clear instructions. Old one was hard to remove as I doubt anyone had ever changed it before I got the car. First I had gotten a Fram Freshbreeze filter locally and after 4 attempts to slide it up the track it broke. Returned it and ordered this one. Slid right in just snug enough and clipped the cover back on in under a minute.

Similar to Viking's satin-edged Detailing Towel (their item 945000) if you want to compare in a local store:=  Both are suitable for a final touch top paint wipe down for "hey neighbor!" or most "roll and show" competitions.+  These CG towels are plusher on the fluffy side with a denser nap (more loops? IDK the term), about the same on the smoother side.+  These CG towels have better stitching on the edge silk (as mentioned by another reviewer).+++ At this Amazon price point these are a no-brainer (even against CG's we-will-give-you-a-coupon-on-our-website price).-  I hate the tag, just like almost every other reviewer. Maybe there is some law or regulation somewhere that requires a tag on a towel (like there is for a mattress?). Carefully rip the tag out prior to use.~  Slightly smaller at 16" x 16" than the Viking at 15.5" x 23" but it is no big deal.~  There were a few - a few - stray strands of lint, a quick shake-and-pick and you're good to go. (You do it anyway, no matter how diligent you are in segregating your towels. And by "you" I mean "I.)After getting these to try out, I will put these towels on Amazon subscription.

Never overpay for your tires again! This bead breaker and tire iron combo really works and works well. If you know how to turn and wrench and have plenty of patience you can do wonders with the BeadPro. Now don't get me wrong its not an "easy" task to mount and balance your own wheels but once you take your time and learn it can save you $80 to $160 depending on shop costs in your area. The bead pro can and will damage the paint on the inside of the wheel if you get a little aggressive and that's alright because 1.) you will never see it once the wheel is mounted 2.) you should not have water inside the wheel so corrosion is not an issue.

Bought for my 2007 v-star 1300 tour and it fits great, it is easy to put on and does keep it from the elements. I bought a house that unfortunatly does not have a garage so this is the next best thing. Holds up the snow without tearing I just go down there after a storm and knock it all off, and during the rest of the time it keeps the sun and other crud off the bike for the most part. On really windy days dust does blow up under the cover but what can you do. Great buy imo and will stick with this brand.

Bought Rugged Ridge tire mount/Hinge kit. Could not get tire close enough to the tailgate and against hinge as instructions dictated. Too high blocks rear view. The teraflex worked perfectly. tight against tailgate hinges. The perfect height because you have a choice where you want it. Used Teraflex  4997220 adjustable third light extension bracket instead of the in wheel light that came with it because I have screw on center caps and i would not put a light their anyway.

Seriously though, the stitching is great. I think as long as you don't hang on them and swing like they are a toy then they will last awhile.The bonus for me was receiving two sets for the price most others charge for one set, and the four clothes rack hangars which are a great deal and quality as well.In my pictures the Jeep letters look fuzzy, but it is just my shaky hands, the letters are clear and our friends love them.

These mats look great. Have tire tread pattern. Should do the job nicely. They fit perfectly in my 2017 jeep unlimited sport. Clip right into factory clips and come flush to kick panels.

I'm not sure what happened to quality control at the manufacturing level, but I installed a problem when I installed this ignition coil. The terminals inside each duo are supposed to be decent, not crappy like on this one. It led to repeat loss of ignition without warning under varying conditions, and we all know that new defective components are the hardest to track down because you suspect them to be a problem LAST.12/7 Additional information...I cut it apart to identify the problem...the connectors inside the molded assembly are too large for anything resembling decent contact (the factory wiring pins/connector are far smaller).

I ordered this minibike from amazon.  First off this item is shipped horribly like everyone has previously stated.  The box is torn apart by the time it reaches your house.  The first mini bike I received worked great for about 2 hours.  After 2 hours of riding the bike, the back sprocket broke free from the screws that were holding it in place.  I think this happened because it is a refurbished product.  The sprocket fell off and the chain came off as well.  I was furious that this happened after 2 hours of riding.  I requested an item replacement because I did not want to deal with taking the bike apart to fix the problem.  The second mini bike came a few days later with the box torn apart again.  This time I put the whole bike together, added oil and gas, and go to start the bike.  Just as I begin to pull the pull starter it is jammed.  I looked at what the problem was and the pull starter was damaged during shipping and would not function properly. I could not start the bike.  I try to package the first mini bike to ship it back and realize its nearly impossible to get it back into the box it was shipped in.  I was fairly mad at this point and I call amazon to explain my situation.  I explain to them what has went on and how ridiculous this is.  They ended up telling me I can keep both bikes and they will refund me the entire amount because you cannot ship anything with gas and oil in it.  I ended up getting rid of the first mini bike and fixing the second one.  All it needed was a new pull starter.  I also suggest taking out the screw that controls the maximum throttle of the bike.  It is one screw above the engine, taking this out will give you about an extra 4pm top end speed.  The bike itself is a great bike and has plenty of power.  The bike is geared on the lower end for maximum torque instead of maximum speed.  Because of this your minibike will LITERALLY be able to go up any hill.  The climbing ability is insane.  Putting together the mini bike is very easy and if you need extra help their is a youtube tutorial.  It comes with all required tools.  I have had the second mini bike for about two weeks now and it is running fine wit no problems.  The only things I had to do were tighten the chain and brakes.  Aside from the few problems I had this minibike is a blast and I would definitely recommend to anyone who is interested in purchasing a minibike.5/13/2017--- UPDATEThe minibike I ended up keeping is already giving me another problem.  As soon as I begin to accelerate there is a huge delay in response time.  Needs to be fixed again...

Everyone knows Duplicolor is the go-to for painting guitars. My latest build is a 57 Fender Tele replica, vintage white blonde. This Toyota creme looked pretty close so I took a shot and tried it. It's perfect! I put a couple of light coats on the front and back to let some grain show thru.So if you want a great vintage Fender color for cheap, get this paint. One can does the job.

Way brighter than OEM , a few of the other reviews that read were stating that some did not work. I was nervous to order because of that matter, but during the install and a few how to videos on YouTube, I came to notice that some of the bulbs are kind of picky on how they want to be inserted. What I mean when I say this is, some went in no problem, some only would be able to go in half way to properly stay on, and others that wouldn't activate would simply have to be rotated to the other side ( light bulbs are just like batteries- +/- sides ).But all in all, they all work pretty good. Sometimes I have to open up some of them and re-do a bulb because it would shut off every once in a while though .

Mounted on a motorcycle and it does exactly what it should do. It charges USB devices. The rubber rain cap ivery handy as it keeps the unit dry and protected. The cap is attached with a rubber tether and is strong or I would have lost it months ago. Overall a good product that is easy to install.

Installed on a jon boat, the 6' strips lights up the inside good enough for me, 12" strips went inside some storage bins.Put some liquid electrical tape on the ends to protect the open ends from shorting out. Ran water over the lights while they were on and seemed to be waterproof.

TAKE NOTE:  This is not an AC Delco part.  I was suspicious when I pulled the tensioner out of a generic brown box sealed with shipping tape.  As you can see from the pictures, "Gates" is stamped on the back of the tensioner.  To make matters worse, this tensioner is smaller than the factory original that I pulled off of my truck.  There is not a single mention of Gates in the product description.  One is falsely led to believe they are buying a genuine AC Delco OEM part.

The instructions that came with this kit are HILARIOUS. (SEE MY PICTURES) They include THE worst English translation imaginable. I laughed out loud reading them....wow....how did the let this go out the door with these instructions? They are so bad I would VOLUNTEER to fix the translation out of sheer pity.Of course this is not confidence inspiring. I mean, if they cannot take 1 hour to ask someone to fix the egregious English errors, ya gotta wonder how much care they took to make the product....that being said, the hand pump arrived with bad seals and I had to return the kit. It worked every 4th pump.As for the radiator / expansion tank connectors, they seem to be very good quality. The color coding and #s engraved on the parts is appreciated. I can tell you that they do not have an adapter for a MAZDA SPEED3 (1st gen). It did work for a Ford F350 7.3 and an R56 Mini Cooper N14 engine.

Can't go wrong with Outlaw Racing, every product I've ordered of theirs has worked great and still going strong, this fuel line is no different. Although, it isn't a solid yellow like the picture shows, it's a clear yellow and not as vibrant, but it still looks good on the bike. I'll be purchasing red fuel line as well. Also, some of you are probably going full-blown OCD about me not having clamps on the fuel line, well, My 1/4" clamps didn't want to fit, had to order smaller ones. Thankfully, some genius invented zip ties that will get me through the weekend.I have to throw a shout-out to Boss Powersports for working with me, as I needed the fuel line by today for an annual trip that is happening this weekend. They are good people, so if possible, please purchase through them.

I have been shopping around for a new set of headlights for my Yamaha FZ1 due to my HIDs occasionally failing to ignite. The new LED style headlights seemed to be a nice upgrade and I eventually bought this set after searching around for a while and comparing products.This set of H4 LED headlight bulbs arrived exactly as advertised and depicted on the product listing. The headlight bulb replacements are a little large on the back of the unit for additional cooling. Be sure to double-check your available space before ordering these. This may be an issue with some vehicles due to space restrictions/ tight engine compartments.Compared to my previous HID kit, these LED bulbs start up instantaneously and do not require a warm up time or initial high voltage spike to ignite the bulbs. This by itself makes this a far nicer kit with less room for failure and also less taxing on the electrical system of my motorcycle.Everything feels and seems to be high quality and well constructed. This is a simple plug and play kit and very straight forward. Unlike HID kits, these LED bulb replacements just have a resistor pack and the bulb permanently wired together. One end of the unit is the LED bulb, the other is the H4 plug for your stock wiring harness.I have been very impressed with the brightness of this kit and it has been performing flawlessly since installed on my motorcycle. I took a few comparison pictures with my 5000k 35W HIDs and this new kit to compare the light output. These bulbs seem significantly brighter and will help me be seen while riding to and from work - my main concern with inattentive drivers. I have no way to measure the actual light output of these headlights unfortunately, but I am very happy with their performance. Light output from this kit is a cool-white LED color. This color temperature (~4000k) will show more true color during hours of darkness compared to my HID lighting. The water and vibration resistance of LED replacement bulbs is another huge selling point for my use (motorcycle). Anyone who rides knows that the motorcycle and it's components are subjected to harsh conditions.Note: In the following pictures the new LED replacement bulb is on the left side as viewed (more white color) and the old HID kit is seen on the right side (more blueish tinge). Some pics show the LED chips lit, showing the arrangement of LEDs during low and high beam modes (low is 2 chips, high is all 4)I have had no issues with this kit or it's construction quality. If something changes or fails I will update this review to reflect that. I was able to purchase this product at a discount in return for my honest, unbiased review.

I installed these on a 2016 Hyundai Elantra SE.  I'll first say that the install is no quick and easy task, but it shouldn't take you all day either.  It took me about an hour and some considerable (although not unreasonable) effort.  That being said, I'm fairly happy with the finished product.  I recommend first watching the installation video on the product website to get a general idea of what is required.  The front seat covers were fairly easy to install with the only challenging part reaching under the seats to find places to attach the clips with the elastic straps.  If you have big fat arms then you might have trouble here and it may be easier for some to just remove the front seat to install the cover.  The rear seats were definitely more challenging and time consuming.  To get a proper fit you will want to remove the rear bottom seat cushion.  Depending on your car and your ability with tools this task may be easy or difficult.  I just watched some videos online on how to remove the rear seat of the Elantra and it was fairly easy once I located the correct bolts.  The only tool I needed was a 12mm socket wrench.  The rear bottom cover is very easy to install snugly once the seat is removed.  For the rear backrest I didn't need to remove the seats.  I just folded the backrests down and the install was fairly easy.  The only tricky part here was that (like in the video) you deed to cut holes for the seatbelt guides and headrest guides with a pair of scissors, but this wasn't all that difficult either.  The only thing I don't care for is the fit of the headrest covers, especially in the rear.  They are simply too large to fit snugly.  Considering that I would have had to spend at least $100 more for custom made seat covers I am quite happy with these seat covers and how they look.  The fabric feels like I would expect and they seem like they should hold up for at least a year or two.  I recommend these for the 2016 Hyundai Elantra and Hyundai/Kia vehicles with similar seats if you want something that looks nice without the big price of custom seat covers and you have average skills with hand tools.

The voltage regulator is bigger then expectedIt fits tightly in my 2003 ford expedition housing.Bulbs are brighter then stock but the actual led angle directly impacts beam spread, it's not smooth.Heat sink seems like it's a reasonable temp after warming up. Even in the sealed housing.I have ordered projector style housing to attempt to improve the light spread.------Update:Ordered projector housing, with these LED bulbs, the light spread becomes a soft flood light. I would almost call this three star. I am returning because I can't get a combination of bulb and housing that was satisfying. I don't completely blame the bulb. Although if the actual LED was not so far forward, I think it would be much much better. As you can see the light spread is inconsistent. Ironically the packaging directly speaks to this problem and shows how these bulbs have a great beam spread. On a plus note, color and function was perfect.

Works almost flawless, soaking up any slight bump steer and high speed trail runs. It does pull now a slight bit to the left due to the heavy compression. That'll probably mellow out or go away entirely over time. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars.

I own a 2004 F-350, it would start shaking when I hit speeds around 30mph and if I went over 65mph. (The steering wheel would shake) I had to replace the carrier bearing and a u-joint at the drive shaft.  That fixed the problem.

Been on the Jeep now for one week. Pretty decent for the price, so far. 3 issues to be aware of, the mounting screws on the new lights are NOT the same as the factory screws and I couldn't get them to screw into the factory mounting tabs. 2, the electrical plugs do NOT click into place, so I used a zip tie around the sockets to insure they don't come un-plugged due to vibrations. 3, the screws that hold the lens on started rusting after the first rain, makes it look ugly, so Im gonna have to remove and replace with something better or paint them. Dont know yet, but Im gonna have to do something about that for sure.

It could have been 5 stars because they only included 4 screws instead of 8 screws. But the product is super nice. Easy to attached on garage walls. I'll just use a 3M double sided tape to replace the 4 pcs screws that's should have been included.

Okay, if you're still trying to decide, here's my take.  In order to get a real good idea of which was the best for me, I bought these along with; CIPA 3-3/4" round, CIPA 2" round and Ampper 2" Round w/Rotation.  All of these are sold here on Amazon and are priced well enough to either hang onto and give out as gifts (LOL) or simply return to Amazon, which is always easy.  I found, for my needs (a 2014 Tacoma), the MaxiView were absolutely the best choice.  Obviously, the CIPA 3-3/4" round are just too big, but didn't know until I saw them, and the CIPA & Ampper 2" round were too small. Actually, not so much small as smaller surface area (being round) to see much of anything.  These MaxiView rectangular, rotational mirrors, are really nice.  When you think about it, most folks vision is best looking at landscape views and with the rectangle shape, you get that.  I will note, the picture shows placing these in the top right corner of your mirror. I wouldn't do that.  I placed them on the lower left corner.  I'm pulling an 18' trailer, which is only as wide as my truck; a good thing.  If you sit in your driver's seat and look at your door mirror, where do you probably look to first?  The top right corner. That section of a car mirror is called the "focal spot" because it's the closest to see to your own car (along the side) and who's directly behind you.  Placing, in my opinion, any blinds spot there, takes away your common use of your mirror. By placing these at the bottom left, you continue to have your direct view of sight down along your car and the mirrors extend out to see further. I've included pics to explain this better.

Very nice flares.  I've installed a couple of the cheaper brands (compared to Bushwacker) and these ones were by far the easiest to install.  They look good and functional as well.  I live on a gravel road and was tired of hearing rocks hit the side of my truck since my MT tires do a good job of throwing them around.  Very happy!

So, I took a wild chance that this would work on my R1200GS - It fastened on easily and last 8000 mile trip without issue and provided me at least 2 extra hours in the saddle over the naked factory seat!  It also looked pretty nice all the while and I got several positive comments during my adventure... Having been in the sun quite a bit, it has begun to turn dark purple but that is expected and a non-issue. I can heartily recommend this to my R1200GS ADV brethren as a low cost option to a Corbin or Seat Concepts seat or the like...

I applied this product to my pickup truck bed.  It took two days for me to complete the project.  I spent a day prepping the bed and applying the first two coats, the next day I applied a third coat.  It could have been done in one day but I spent a lot of time on the bed prep.  I used a gallon and 1 quart to cover a 6 foot bed.  That gave me three coats of product.  It was glossy black at first, but after a couple of weeks outside it looks kind of like a flat black now.  It is still adhered to the bed very well, no chipping or peeling.  I used medium grit sanding sponges to scuff the paint and followed up with the scotch brite pad.  For the rest of the application I followed the manufacturer's directions.  As with any paint, surface prep is the key.  I'm happy with the results.

This is the first rinseless wash I have used so I cannot compare to others, but I am very impressed with this one. My car wasn't covered with thick mud/grime but it had a thin film of dirt/dust and this product cleaned it perfectly. Even did a nice job on the windows. And it didn't leave visible scratches or swirls on the paint of my new car (do not apply heavy pressure).  May not use this for heavy duty washing of mud and grime, but I know it works great for casual washings.I also diluted this product with water at about a 1:16 ratio in a spray bottle to use as a quick detailer/spot treatment and it does an excellent job.Overall this is my most used car detailing product.

Installed this cooler on my Chevy Trailblazer, the size was perfect to fit in the opening behind the grille, in front of the condenser.  Needed to order an extra length of tubing, as the one that came with it wasn't long enough to split between the incoming and return lines.  The steel strips were handy to make brackets, but if you don't have a metal break, buying some aluminum strips may be an easier route to go.

Installed in my 2016 Kia Soul BASE. Took me forever due to locating the correct wire diagrams (see pics). Works great. The way I set it up locks/unlocks all doors (5). I added "Directed Electronics 506T I.T. Audio Sensor" and "Install Essentials 513T Mini Piezo Siren" inside too. Now I have an alarm and keyless entry. I did not use all the wires. I have two pending: 1- Hood trigger (need to purchase switch) and 2-Dome Light supervision which is under the A-Pillar (note: to remove the A-Pillar you will have to break/replace one if the tabs for removal). ((Dome Supervision - yellow/black (-) driver front pillar, white 30 or 24 pin plug, pin 16))WARNING: Stay away from any thick yellow wires with test light. Will trigger airbags!

Husband and I just finished cleaning our 2002 40 ft Monaco RV with Aero Cosmetics Wash Wax All. As stated by others above, it is a great product, it only took us 2 hours to do the whole job, and we could not be happier with the results. That's right; 2 people for 2 hours to wash away 12 months and 5,000 miles of sun-baked road grime, leaving a lustrous, restored wax shine with no buffing. This is our first application, so we have no idea how long she'll look so good, but if we have to do this a few times a year, I'll be happy.BTW: we bought the 144oz Wash Wax All kit on Amazon and only used 1/3 of the product to get results pictured.

Installed on a 2005 Tundra passenger side. Worked well and was easy to install. As some other have mentioned, the screw holes on the motor are self tapping, so I lined up the holes with the track, hand screwed them all at the same time, little by little to make sure the motor gear lined up with the teeth. The polarity was in reverse for my truck so I had to swap the wires. I used splice connectors which made it easy, but I should have cut the wires closer to the other  end of the connector, so they would sit on the inside of the door's plastic water shield. I think the connections will be ok though since they are pretty tight.One more thing: before you put the new motor and rack back in, plug it in and make sure that the window goes up and down properly and see if you have to reverse the wires like I did. You might be able to pull the wire harness out and reverse it after you install the motor into the door, but testing it first will save time.

You have to take the bumper off in order to install the front bolts. There is no way on a 1999 Cherokee sport to do it any other way. Taking the bumper off is really easy, after you remove the end caps. The end caps have 4 bolts. Two of the bolts you can easily see. The other two bolts are high inside and connect the end cap to the fender. You have to force out the fender lining a bit in order to see them. Use a flash light or your cell phone light. One the 4 bolts are out the end cap will slide right off. Then there are only 4 bolts holding on the bumper.

I ordered this to use to repair some USB power cables for my electronics that were becoming frayed.  I also used it to patch some Sony  headphones as well as a few other items.  The headphones had broken and the pieces were lost long ago but I used the adhesive as a hard covering for the electronics of the earpieces and it has worked out fine (see photos).  The process usually takes a few steps where you layer coats of the adhesive to build up the repair.  If you try to put too much on in one coat, it will drip.  I purchased a separate UV light to harden the adhesive rather than the one suggested by the manufacturer of the product.  I used a 365nm wavelength light and found that the adhesive hardened faster than with a 400nm light. (Americans' Preferred 12 UV Light -365nm).IMPORTANT POINT: The adhesive works if you are trying to fill a gap or cover something with a hard plastic barrier, but will not glue two pieces together where there isn't any gap for the UV light to shine on the material in order to harden the adhesive.  That would be a task for super glue where there isn't an airspace between parts that you are gluing together.  The UV light has to illuminate the adhesive or it won't harden.  Direct daylight works as well to harden the adhesive but you can be more precise with the UV flash light. I see many reviews where someone misunderstood how this is used to repair something. There must be a way for the light to illuminate the material otherwise it will not hold.  It will work to bridge two pieces together if you layer the material and harden the material using the light between layers.  Once the repair is complete, the adhesive is clear and gets even harder.  The manufacturer says the material can be sanded but I haven't tested that yet. So far, no reason to do so.I would definitely recommend this product to anyone as long as they understand how to apply the material.  Once I run out of this batch of adhesive, I plan re-order.  This is a handy thing to have in your shop for fast repairs.  The adhesive 000-

I wish I had an OEM one to compare against as I feel the range on these cannot be as good as it would be on OEM dongles..  That being said, they were simple to pair and they have HELD their pairing unlike several other brands I've tried.  These ones work.  As far as range goes, I cannot seem to get them to work outside of about 25', as I said, I've never had an OEM one so I don't know if this is typical, if it is and someone corrects me I'll gladly change my review to 5 stars.I used these in my 2004 Ford Ranger Edge 4.0 Supercab.

These airbags themselves are great quality, but the installation hardware is poor, and you are required to discard valuable stock parts.The GOOD:1) Airbags are made with high quality Goodyear rubber.2) Mounting brackets are heavy duty and well made.3) The internal jounce bumpers seem like a good idea, and allow the bags to run with no air.The BAD:1) The installation requires that several hose and wiring brackets be discarded. These do actually serve a purpose, keeping brake lines and wires from rubbing and chafing.  There is no provision in the kit to secure these lines, and the potentially could lead to a serious problem if wires get cut, or brake lines wear through.2) The installation on a 2011 GM truck requires you to fish a couple bolts through small frame holes. To secure that bolt, it is pretty tricky to drop a socket in the hole, then attach the socket to the ratchet inside the frame.The UGLY:1) The installation call for TWO large frame clamps to reposition the e-brake cable, but ONLY ONE is included in the kit! This is not an accidental omission either, since the parts list explicitly specifies 1.  Has no one noticed this problem in 3 years?2) The U-bolts are too long.  This means that there is a lot of thread hanging down, but more importantly that the nut runs out of thread before it is properly torqued.  You must add washers to avoid the problem of the nut running past the thread.3) The U-bolts are too wide for the frame. The bracket may slip side to side since there is at least 1/2" empty space to slop around.4) Allowing brake lines and wires to rub and tangle is both BAD and UGLY, since it has the potential to cause damage to safety-critical components.  The GM engineers put those line holders and brackets there for a reason, but Airlift carelessly discards them.Overall, I am happy with the quality but very disappointed with the installation.

Finally bought key, etc finders. Not to mention, a multi pack....score! My fiance is constantly misplacing her keys, phone, anything and everything she puts down. I opened the pack, took out main remote and removed the tab over battery. I then did the same on all other tags. I pressed the corresponding colors and the tags all beeped. When pressed, the tags will only beep once. In order to make it continuously beep so you can find your lost item, you must hold down the colored button for the colored tag you need. There is a little red indicator light that will light up when pressed. The beep is loud enough to hear but not too loud. I put one on her keys, her phone, and our house phone. I have one to spare, for when she starts misplacing anything else used a lot. Received this product for review.

Not an exact replacement, no auto dimmer and a thinner bezel. You can see the missing wire in my photo otherwise a good replacement. Needed some tweaks too. The terminals for heat were thinner and I had to pinch the wire terminal to get a tight fit. I also had to pull the two metal clips from my old mirror I believe they are anti vibration clips not essential but very helpful. I'm glad I did not dispose of my broken mirror before the new one arrived. I also had to tilt the adjusting mechanism all the way down and stick a screwdriver behind to hold it out firmly enough to get the mirror to snap in completely.

If you are in the market for a gas lighter only - then this multi-sparker by CAMCO is ideal.Like all Piezo electric sparkers, this lighter creates sparks only so, it's not for lighting candles, barbecue coals etc - for that you need a butane flame lighter.This lighter is on the big side - much of the size is to house a 'C' type battery to power the multi spark feature.  This makes lighting your gas powered stoves and ovens super easy by pressing on an ultra soft touch button.SEE MY PHOTOS IN CUSTOMER IMAGESWhat I like most about this sparker? ... There are no cumbersome safety switches to hold down :)NOTE:The shape of the burners and subsequently, how the gas flows differs from stove to stove so, positioning the lighter would vary ... On our ten year old Whirlpool gas range, the best lighting technique is by holding the 7" curved lighting pipe parallel to the stovetop and touching the burner.  However, on our GE table top, the best lighting technique was holding the lighting pipe slightly away from  the burner and at an angle to the stovetop.So far, this Piezo electric multi sparker works everytime.  According to Camco, the Heavy Duty 'C' type battery (included with this unit) is good for 10,000 sparks (about one year of regular use).MY RECOMMENDATION: Upgrade to an Alkaline 'C' type battery and your multi sparker will ignite your gas burners even easier!Check around before you buy this Camco 57533 Olympian Multi Sparker Igniter - the price varies on Amazon.Hope my review and photos were helpful ..

Though another reviewer said these were as good as the Bosch Icon, they are no where close! Yes, Valeo makes Bosch wipers, but the Bosch wiper is so much bigger and sturdier. I have uploaded pics to compare. I will use the Valeo, but no doubt they won't last nearly as long as they are much more flimsy. Probably better than OEM wipers, but I expected more. So, though I hate to spend $48 on a pair of Bosch Icons, I will next time. You get what you pay for in this case, anyway

Nice little light.  Not rigid industries but for the price Im happy.  My bike has garbage for light so this should do well.Im docking a star for only one reason.The powder coated mounts already had paint missing.  I scuffed them all up and painted again.  Not a big deal and par for the course of economy lights

Just installed this on my triump street triple. It doesn't come with a mount so I had to use zip ties and glue tapes. Because it has the solid sae connection the cable from the device doesn't quite curve away smoothly but after some trial and error was able to fit it just right. The on off switch is a good thing so I can simply turn charging off when my bike is off. Power output is as promised, had my phone fully charged while using water for my commute. Initial impression is that this is a solid product.

I've used these several times without too much problem.I don't like having to keep track of the extra "wheel" of straighteners when I'm not using it. There must be a better design out there somewhere. The more your fins are bent, the slower this process goes, but I've been able to take fins that are completely crushed and straighten them out with this tool. It's not the most lovely or ergonomic piece of gear I own, but it works. Make sure you know the pitch of your fins before wasting a bunch of time trying to get them straight.In the pictures below, this is a rooftop unit that had gotten bumped in a few places. The fins were smashed completely flat. The spot pictured took less than 60 seconds to straighten. As you can see, I didn't mess around with it to get them perfect, just good enough to allow heat transfer again.

i installed these (H16 5202 type 1) on my 2009 Ford Escape Hybrid. i recommend removing the fog light housing to install the bulb since the rubber o-ring might make it really tight.it's a little too bright and the light scatters too much. it probably won't serve the purpose of fog lights since the light is white and scattered. i'm kinda regretting now that i didn't get a pair of yellow (3000K) LED fog lights.i wish they made LED bulbs that are slightly brighter than the stock bulb and have a similar light distribution as a stock halogen filament so that the fog light reflector could work properly as intended.photo 1: ISO100, f4, 1/500photo 2: ISO100, f4, 1/1000top left/right: stock 3157AK bulbsbottom left: JDM ASTAR 1200 lumens LED H16 bulbbottom right: stock halogen bulb (PS24WFF H16 500 lumens)

This product worked to mount my Yakima ski rack to my Toyota factory bars. As mentioned in another review, there was difficulty in using some of the original hardware. I picked up standard bolts to replace the Yakima bolt and had a much easier time with the install. Otherwise the Yakima bolts have wings that are turned to tighten. Due to their size they were too large to tighten once installed.

I bought the same brand back in 2016 lasted two years and finally died on me. So I couldn't find the one with the adjustable dial in the same brand so I ordered this one with only two speeds.  I drive a school bus in South Louisiana with no A/C so I don't expect cold air coming through the seat cover but I expect to feel some wind.  NOT IN THIS COVER! When you sit on it, all the air vents are completely blocked! I have to lean up to feel any air flow.  Finally found the same brand with the adjustable dial, hopefully it works. Can't tell when it's on or off when sitting on the cover other than hearing the fan run. See video. Will not even blow a piece of toilet paper!

Bought three sheets of these since I have a ton of sockets rattling around.  They apply easily, I used denatured alcohol and paper towels to clean the sockets first.  Easy to see, the numbers really stand out in the box.  I'd recommend to anyone approaching a 'certain age' who is squinting at their tools now.I'm going to buy a couple of more sheets and apply to my combo wrenches as well

Chemical guys is hands down the best products in there price range. Instawax is just another one of there many amazing products. One of the coolest things asbout instawax is that you can apply it in direct sunlight! Of course many factors play a huge role in how long it lasts on the vehicle but I get a solid 2 weeks of beading and 3-4 weeks of nice deep gloss and thats parking outside in Oregon weather. Also it is very easy to wipe off if you accidently get it on trim/plastics. Chemical guys has loads of amazing products and this is one of them. The paint in the picture is 11 years old and nothing on it except chemical guys products

I give it 3 stars for the simple fact these were a bitch to put on, and the passenger side liner didn't even have the holes drilled out to mount it to the frame. The instructions were pretty vague and didn't help much but damnit I wanted these and they look so good on so I can overlook the flaws.

See photo of the painted area next to original paint on my 2002 snowblower.I bought this to re-paint a cub cadet snowblower from the early 2000's.  After wire-wheel brushing, sandblasting, rust-treating, and priming, this was my final step.  The first thing I noticed is that the nozzle on this can is high quality.  I wish it produced a fan-shaped pattern instead of a round one, but when I held the can about 9 inches away the pattern was 5-6 inches wide.  This made it easy to overlap properly and avoid runs.  By comparison, the rust-oleum primer I had used produced a pattern about 3 inches wide, and was really hard to keep from running and sagging. The rust-oleum nozzle also dripped and ran down my hand like crazy, but I had no such trouble with the Valspar. I sprayed a light coat over the entire disassembled snowblower, but that used up the whole can.  I'm now ordering two more cans to make sure that I have enough to put a second good coat on the blower.  I may need a third coat because this paint does not seem very opaque, everything shows through more than I thought it would.Some final thoughts:-Use a gray primer, not a black one because this paint doesn't cover well (those complaining about color match issues may just be seeing the primer showing through)-Buy an extra can, because it doesn't go as far as you think it will.-Cub Cadet changed their shade of yellow over the years, but this is a good match from about 2000 to present.-This paint says it needs to be applied above 65 degrees, which may be an obstacle for some people with cold sheds.-Prep and prime, or it won't lastUPDATE: It took 3 full cans to properly paint a snowblower (one coat per can).  Now that it's done it looks brand new, but I wish it hadn't required so many coats to keep the primer from showing through.  I was also surprised at how quickly the cans ran out.  In spite of these shortcomings, I think this paint is the best option for those wanting to paint their cub cadet equipment.

I found the install reasonably easy considering there are no instructions.  I used the factory opening ( a bronze plate ) next to the brake vacuum canister and resealed it with a custom gasket made out of window insulating foam.  The switch fit nicely next to my dash dimmer switch. I T-tapped the 12v input side of the dimmer ( this 12v is only for the switch to send the signal to the relay ), so the fog lights only come on when the parking or headlights are on.  I didn't even need the extension wire for the relay.  I was impressed how well all the wires fit and the fog lights popped into the sockets tightly, yet with little force.  My fog lights are not yellow at all.  They are much whiter and brighter than my GE Nighthawk headlamps.  Of course the light is directed mostly down and to the sides, but standing about 50 feet in front of my car they looked to have the same brightness as my headlights.  I haven't had anyone flash their high-beams at me yet, so I think they are OK in spite of there intensity.  Turning the fog lights on after the headlights are on seems to triple the overall illumination in front of my truck.  The fog lights on my old 90 Eagle Talon are a joke compared to these!  Time for another upgrade!

I bought these mirrors to fit my 2009 GMC Sierra 1500 SLT. I had motorized, heated and the blinker. Everything is the same except they have to be manually folded. The fit great! Everything was exact and bolted up. No instructions were provided but after a couple of videos the night before. It was pretty easy. Do not loose the nuts or bolts in the doors!!!! You have to reuse them to hold the mirror in place. Wireing was easy. Just plug and play. Hardest part was getting the panel back on! All in all a great product. I would bye this again. It took me and my dad about 1 hour and 45 minutes to install both with just a 10mm socket, flat head screw driver, and a little bit on common sense!

This is a quality spring compressor.  I have used it about 10 times over the past 4 years.  It compresses springs very quickly if you have a impact gun. I have never dealt unsafe while using this tool.  This tool is holding up well, looks as good as it did when I bought it.

Plugged it in and connected to it. Started at the top and worked on down the line.Best hits include: folding mirrors with remote. Trunk open/close with remote. That stupid disclaimer is gone!

I installed this in my conversion on my living quarter horse trailer and installation was very straight forward! The breakers were easily available at Home Depot for a main breaker and the extra breakers.  The fuses were easily found in the electrical department at Home Depot as well!  The fan is hardly noticeable when it is on, but a slight hum does come from it.  I couldn't be happier with this unit and will definitely purchase this again if I am in need of a compact all in one converter.

Arrived with the bolts and mounting hardware loose, chipping and scratching the lights. BOTH lights had separate bags for the bolts/hardware, and BOTH were torn wide open with everything banging around in the box. Naturally, some of the yellow paint is ruined as a result.Lights are ok for the price I guess. Shipping is another matter entirely. This is not acceptable.

Genuine GM replacement part. Fit perfectly and made repairing the rear engine cover leak a simple process. GM has several EXPENSIVE specialty tools to install the front and rear covers, and oil pan on the LS style engine. I have never used them, and have not had any problems. With the main seal preinstalled, the OE tools would not work anyway. Additionally, the rear main seal can center itself over the rear crank snout, unlike the front cover where it actually seals against the damper pulley, not the crank. The OE method, installs the rear cover without the seal, then installs the seal, so positioning of the cover prior to the seal would be critical.Bolts originally were a 10mm head, revised bolts were a 13mm head.Installation: I applied a small bead of RTV to the joint of the oil pan gasket and the rear of the block on the left and right sides. I positioned the cover with the seal protector still fitted, as the bolts are retained by the cover seal. I worked my way around and started all of the cover bolts and allowed the cover to loosely fit over the crank snout, pushing the seal protector from inside of the seal. Once the cover bolts were finger snug to the back of the engine, I installed the two long oil pan bolts and torqued them to 106 in-lbs. The cover bolts are then torqued to 18 ft lbs. Before doing that, I snugged them all with a socket then loosened the long oil pan bolts to ensure the cover was pulled into place. Then retorqued the oil pan bolts, and then the rear cover bolts in a criss cross pattern.

The helmet worked fine for a little over a month.Today one side of the visor came loose... it just popped off the side of the helmet. Initially it looked like the screw holding the hub that holds the visor just got loose. I tightened it and was able to reattach the visor, but it did not work properly. It could not be raised and lowered as it could before.When I got home I removed the visor and removed the hubs that hold the visor on both sides. I found what is illustrated in the attached photo.The right side hub (B) shows a plastic tab that is missing on the left side hub (A). The tab broke off of the left side hub. Without that tab, the whole hub mechanism rotates when I attempt to raise or lower the visor. Because the mechanism does not stay in place, the visor cannot be raised and lowered properly.I paid $120 for this helmet and expected more than an month and a half or normal use out of it. Very dissatisfied.UPDATE:I need to give credit where it's due... I referred the matter to Amazon Customer Service and they're sending a replacement helmet that should be here today.FYI: I also contacted the LS2 Customer Service to ask about the broken part. They said they provide replacements for broken parts for 3 months EXCEPT FOR PURCHASES MADE THROUGH AMAZON. Interesting.I think my next helmet will be a different brand.

Great except for the front passenger mat -- it should be longer as it creeps forward and there is about a 1 or 2 inch gap that is not being protected by the mat.  The material is good; the design is bad for the 4runner.

I'm tired of replacing my Windshield wiper blades. I've been using Anco for decades. I did a test in Fall of 2015 to Spring 2017 Lower Michigan. One side Anco, One Side Bosch. Only 5000 miles (Normal for me) on the car in that time, AND theres many times I don't use the front Wipers because I do a lot of Freeway Driving.  May of 2017... Anco Blade is completely on its last filament of attachment to the wiper blade. Rubber is completely deteriorated... I can't use it. Also this car is always in the garage.  GOODBYE ANCO! This is pathetic. Seriously you've had 40 years of my money! NO MORE!

I didn't buy a relay kit or warning canceller took 30 minutes to install the driver headlight is a Hassel to change unless you take off the grill. But I just bent the washer fluid reservoir back and got it these are super bright I got the 6000k and it's pure white to match my truck other cars get upset they are brighter than the high beams and cover a bigger area in all directions.

After a year and half, it's still a great light!  I've not had any of the problems others have said about water or moisture getting inside the light.  I've driven thru mud, driving rain and snow.  The wiring harness is super easy to connect and haven't had problems with power drainage.  In fact, I like the little red glow from the switch.  It looks like an car alarm light glowing in the armed setting.One thing I didn't do is use the brackets that came with it.  Where I mounted the light in my Ford Ranger grill, didn't have enough clearance to use the included brackets.  Instead I used some 2 X 2 inch steel cabinet angle brackets with new stainless screws and star washers for grip.  Check out my pics.I realize these lights are no longer available but wanted to add my review in case they become available again or  in comparison to their other products.

I went with this intake over others because it has the straightest pipe, no 90degree elbows to slow down air flow, and a very wide mouth. I took me about 10 minutes to install, including removing the oem intake. It is a beauty. You can hear it sucking air in, with a nice throaty sound, and it does boost torque and throttle response noticeably.

It takes some patience and technique but the color is well worth it. The can was more than enough for multiple coats on all the calipers and we even used the excess to paint the tail pipe and do some designs on the oil pan just for the hell of it. Well worth the money, but set aside a lot of time to do it properly. My girlfriend absolutely loves it! I waited a few months to make sure it's been holding up, and it still looks fantastic. It dries super hard and doesn't scratch easy. It would be nice if it came with a touch up kit too just in case but I don't think I'll need it.

If you want a cosmetic change to your antenna without losing any significant reception this 17in all terrain black is the way to go! It looks way better than the stock 31 inch that my Ram had and unlike the other smaller ones this one still keeps up with all my saved stations. Completely recommend.

This light is bigger than it needs to be, there's a lot of wasted space in the cheap plastic housing. The LED array also rattles around a bit, even though it's snapped into place.One thing that wasn't apparent from the description, ON and Motion modes alternate each time you turn the switch on. At first it seemed like you had to open it up to switch modes, luckily that's not the case.

Plastic is very thin and soft. Warped the day after installation. The middle sags into the cockpit and the outer fins are wavey. DO NOT PAY for this junk roof! They will not return if you install it and find out it is a cheap excuse for a roof."This seller will not refund the amount of their product. They sold me a cheaply made product and per their return policy after I requested a return label states they will not return the item after installation. I don't want this roof due to very poor workmanship quality. The item was installed and the sun warped it in one day. NOT HAPPY. I want my money back for this item and they can have their junk back."

Hi All,  everyone here is complaining this doesn't fit  06-09 4runner.  In fact it fits perfectly. The problem is that folks trying to insert the middle section  skirt into  4 bolts on the grill ,  but that is not the correct way  and it is not well explained on the instruction either unfortunately.  After fiddling  few times trying to insert the thing into bolts i realized it is not the correct way.  Just sandwich the skirt between grill and hood and tighten the 2 edges/ wings/ end sections by screwing into the hood by supplied rubber bolt.  I wish i could explain better but  i cannot believe the manufacturer not taking any action and letting a good product  getting hammered because they made a sloppy instruction and made the things worse by drilling holes into the skirt section.  I REPEAT IT DOES FIT  06-09  4RUNNERS ,  i have included picture of my car for that  JUST DON"T TRY TO MOUNT VIA SCREWS ,  just  wedge in between the hood and grill.

I wasn't paid for this. This is an honest review because these lights are wow! Bought these to try them out. I have a 2002 corvette convertible and at night it can kinda be hard to back up because I have a longish drive away out in the country. These suckers are literally brighter than my day lights! There's some pictures to prove it. Before with the stock dimmer dulbs the with the 2057 LEDs. I love them will buy more for my truck! All taken with my phone and no filters or any funny buisiness.

I was happy with these at first. But they only lasted about 4 months and half a dozen falls. Last time I ended up with a fairly serious injury to my hand. May not have been because of the hand gaurds, but I'd like for them not to break off. I know they are not supposed to be bombproof, but I will be replacing them with a more reputable brand.

I'm not exactly in total agreement with the manufacturers claim that it "Clicks on tight". I have a 2" coupler, which is the largest size this lock will secure, and it's a relatively loose fit. If anything it should fit snug.I was able to fit a standard size crowbar into several vulnerable openings.  So, I guess it all boils down to the strength of the steel and whether it will fail if pried upon.  Hopefully I'll never find out.

When I first opened this, I was a quite underwhelmed.  It smelled like cardboard with an additional smell, which could be described of as vanilla.  However, once it aired for a couple minutes, I installed in my vehicle and I could smell just the faint vanilla scent.About 15 minutes later, the pure power of The Punisher manifested and my exterior was clean.  It is as if Castle himself scared all the salt and sand from snow-melt off my vehicle..  It is so powerful though, that it may have cracked my windshield. Truly impressive.Will this smell last long?  Oh I doubt it.  The Air Freshener looks cool though.

Killer price and look goodOnly and yes the Only downside is the mountsno way to weld a bead onto them to make the stronger.They only mount via one body bolt on each end but at 230lb I don't feel they won't hold up - just would have been nice to have a good place to weld a support onto the body or better to the frame - it's a Jeep whit a Chevy 350 in it soOver-Kill is it's way of life.  FYI- I have read a 300lbs man has had zero issues and I will say for the price if they have an issue in two years who cares at this price.  The wife can use them to climb into the truck.I will say the are just what I needed and I am happy with the looks and the  functionality of them.  Damanupnorth

This was exactly what I was looking for!  I wanted a small, simple bar mount to put some LED light on to enhance the look and lighting with my 2005 Honda Element EX. I drilled new holes (previous ones in bumper were not standard sized) and bolted this through the bumper. This is very lightweight and didn't stress the bumper at all. I highly recommend this if you're looking for one!These are the LED lights shown in the photos:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/LED-Light-Bar-Northpole-Light-2x-27W-Round-Flood-LED-Work-Light-Driving-Fog-Light-Off-Road-Lights-IP67-Waterproof-for-Off-road-Truck-Car-ATV-SUV-Jeep-Boat/dp/B01EAEM6XK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">LED Light Bar, Northpole Light 2x 27W Round Flood LED Work Light Driving Fog Light Off Road Lights IP67 Waterproof for Off-road, Truck, Car, ATV, SUV, Jeep, Boat</a>

These are very very bright. I have them mounted on my hand guards of my WR450 that I converted to be street legal. I ended up cutting down the threaded plastic piece so they didn't stick into the area where the clutch/brake levers are.Unfortunately, due to them being mounted on the hand guard, I have already broke one riding in the woods. Not sure if I will buy again or just replace them both with some blinkers that could mount to the forks. These area a bit larger than you might expect, see attached photo.

This cover fits like a glove after dabbing it with water and carefully stretching it over the steering wheel. I read bunch of reviews stating that the cover is too small. IT IS NOT, in order to fit like a glove it has to be "a little small". When dabbed with water it becomes flexible and stretchable-than you pull it over the steering wheel and stretch it to fit perfectly. When it dries, it shrinks a bit and "molds" perfectly around the contours of the steering wheel. No "Shar Pei" skin look. I installed it on my 2016 CRV SE.The leather is great, it feels awesome and the wheel became beefier. The included thread is more than enough to sew the whole thing. I have enough left over for the long side of the cover to be sewn again.I opted not to use the double sided tape as it is too "permanent" of a solution. I am afraid that  the tape might leave residue if I decide to remove the cover at some point. It looks great, almost OEM.Update:A month and 1500 miles later-I love the cover-it feels great to the touch and looks great. I decided to order another cover in case Kust does not sell them in a few years...yeah, I know but for that price?!?!why not!:)Great service again and great kit-tools and materials are even better than last time!Thank you guys!Update2: after 6 months of use and about 5000 more miles the cover still looks and feels awesome. The pictures that are attached to this review were taken after 6 months of use and 1 application if 303 airospace protectant for UV protection of the leather cover. The 2 close ups are from the back side of the steering wheel where some say "not cut well, had to modify"...not true, fits like a glove...

Awesome, looked like it wouldn't fit,  but once it's on looks amazing and feels flush with the wheel. Fit on my 2004 Mustang v6 convertible. I'll see if sun damage occurs but so far so good. I've been to the beach (bright and sunny) a few times and left my top down parking and sun damage hasn't been happening.Looks good feels good and the wheel is a bit wider but I got used to it no problem and makes the steering wheel feel a bit more reliable. My steering wheel was getting sticky and I put this right on and it's been great.

Extremely easy to install and looks great on my 2006 Denali XL. I had to get out the Dremel tool to increase the wiring harness opening by approx. 1/16 of an inch, but nothing to difficult to handle. The written instructions were clear but the photos were in black and white and not very easy to make out.I opted to use the installation instructional video off the manufacturers website and that cleared up any confusion.Have already received a few compliments on the new look. Definitely a simple comestic upgrade and worth the investment

This filter feels very solid. It has a good weight to it. The plastic components are a high quality rigid material and are attached firmly to the filter media. Even the manufacturer's info etched on the end of the filter is crisp and easy to read (see attached photo). I have used K&N and Wix professional filters, both of which are now imported, and this AC Delco filter easily matches them in quality of construction at about half the price. I will update this review after a 5000 mile stint in my aging '05 Chevy Cavalier ecotec.** UPDATE Oct 2016 **I'm on my second or third of these filters, running them for 5-7000 miles each. They hold up and retain their shape very well, better than others I've used in the past.

I'll still trying to decide if I'll keep it -  the quality isn't nearly as expected. The paint is missing/flaking in some places, the nozzle is corroded and there were a couple small dents in the can (the packaging was fine so I was shipped from the factory that way).  Looks decent from 15 feet, but up close, it looks like Chinese Harbor Freight quality. I expect it will probably function fine, which is why I bought it, but I wouldn't be too proud to say this was "Made in USA".  Also the vent relief handle is plastic instead of metal as shown in the picture. I recognize that is it just a gas can, but I definitely expected it to be nicer for the price. I've include some pictures of the poor paint job and the corrosion -- I could have included a couple more

Overall, pretty good. They were very easy to install although there is more of a gap on the driver side than it is on the passenger side but no big deal. (See third pic) They do seem to shake a little bit above 55 like everybody was saying but no big deal. That is why I did not give them 5 star review. Installed these on a 2011 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 2 wheel drive extended cab. All functions work, and i can see alot better with our 22 foot camper. Plugged right in, wires were plenty long.  I used factory foam behind mirrors, they werr thicker.

Bought these to service a Lotus Elise.  Worked perfectly.  I've only backed the car onto them, so I don't have experience driving forward onto them with a low profile car.They didn't budge while I was backing onto them - my wife spotted for me - so no problems such as half a tire hanging off.  It was useful to remove half the ramp to gain more access.  However, if I had to do more than just change oil, then I would probably need more clearance, but at least this gets me access to take off the under tray so I can do more jacking if needed.It is true that they suggest they not be stored in the sun or a trunk due to temperature - I'm not sure why one would - I put them in the attic.I was surprised how light, yet sturdy they are, so you could hang them from the handle on the wall, but the removable ramp piece would fall, so not really an option.I don't see that they are only for high performance cars.  I plan to service my daily drivers on them as well.

Great quality. Looks amazing on my 1994 F150 XL. Hardware did not seem to be all there. Stock hardware will not work.  Directions are total crap. Ended up installing in my own intuitive way with bolts I already had in my garage and a little bit of cutting into the plastic to get the top metal tabs of the grille to line up with the holes already in the plastic (horizontal slots in the plastic), but it works and looks very clean. I've had it on now for a couple months and have no complaints other than what was listed. Basically, you'll need to be creative to properly install this grille. It required a 3" hole to be cut in the plastic and I didn't know this before I purchased. Just know, it is possible to get it all in and working without cutting.  It's just a pain.

Great product, great feel and grip. After carefully measuring my wheel and following the sizing guide I ordered. Now I'm very satisfied with the results. One of the best leather wheel covers I've installed.  After watching a couple of YouTube videos about lacing these up I took my time and was able to install this in a just over an hour.  It does take some skill and patients to do right. My vehicle now looks like it has a premium factory leather wheel!

First time I used it, I kept having some signal drop offs. From time to time it would take 2-3 seconds to refresh the value.I was thinking to return it, but tried it again. This time I used it to monitor fuel pressure during 1 hr commute.It worked fine. It would refresh about every .2 s and it never dropped for longer than this.I suspect that interference with other 2.4 ghz signals around the house had something to do.Attached are some screen shots from OBDCarDoctor.Over all device is definitely worth $20. Itsso much better to be able to use app on your phone than regular OBD reader.

Don't wait and neglect changing your air filter, your engine will appreciate it....The last owner (I've had this car a week now) obviously did not take care of the car, amongst a bunch of other things I thought I may as well do was to order the filter and change it (and even if it didn't, for $10, i'll just hold onto it until it was required) ... and BOY was I glad I did.For the EOS, the directions to change are pretty straightforward...1. disconnect the air tube running from very front of car (drivers side) to engine cover (where this filter lives btw)2. disconnect the MAF (electrical plug running into it) at the back (passenger side) of the engine cover3. disconnect the air tube running beside the MAF (has two metal clips, be careful that you don't drop it into the engine compartment if they come off)4. lift up the whole engine cover which is held by four rubber stoppers.. there may need to be a bit of force ... there are two at the front, two at the back.5. lay it upside down on a towel / cardboard / grass so you don't scratch the top side of the cover, and undo the screws (about 8)6. once the screws are undone, you should be able to lift the cover from the front (furtherest away from the heat shield) and be aware of the 'hinges' at the back..7. swap over the filter, shut the lid, and go in reverse to put it all back...And don't wait till your filter is in as bad shape as the one i found !And i think the above directions are about the same for most VW's. (2000's to 2010's?)Why pay the dealership for something you can do so cheaply and easily yourself?

I did some research as to how to improve the lights on my squarebody and found these. They connect straight to my factory harness and for the stock ring and housing. Low beam draws around two amps high is around 3 total. If I left my lights on accidentally they wouldn't kill my battery for hours. The projection is great with a  nice cutoff at the top like a projector lens, and the low and high beams come on at the same time for enhanced close visibility. Overall these are nice heavy cast units with a polycarbonate lens that will not shatter when hit by rocks. It's much nicer to drive at night with modern lighting on my 1973 truck. I am very happy with this purchase. I received this item at a discounted price for an honest review

I just put these on my 50cc scooter tonight, and they do look awesome, they are super bright with a cell phone flash but I haven't tested them on the road yet but I can assume they will be the same with headlights of other cars. My scooter rims are 10" so I still have about 6 strips left, each side took 2.5 strips.  They were easy to put on but took a bit of time being that I could not put them on flat because of my type of scooter rim, but they molded perfectly to the fit that I needed. Now I just gotta get blue ones for my dads blue scooter.  I also posted a couple of images so people can see what they look like on a scooter.

Took this on a ride from California to the Argentina - then all over every dirt road I could ride in South America. The zippered case was too large to fit so the pump rode unprotected in the under-seat compartment of a DL650; I crammed the accessories in a small cloth bag.  Why FIVE STARS --> It worked every time I needed it, over several years, and frequently for many bikes as we aired-up after coming off dirt or gravel roads. It's simple design is a plus (see photo) and it was still working when I sold the bike 3 years later.  I suggest you hard wire a connector/pigtail to the battery directly as the provided clips are a little cheezy.  Also, when you need it, Slime is a must have.

Very easy install.  The Allen wrens he's included in the kit are garbage and didn't fit some of the mounting screws, but that doesn't detract from the lights.  Ditch the printed instructions and pull up the instructions that are on their website.  They are color and do a better job of showing how to install these.Lights are bright, probably brighter than my headlamps.  Check out the picture to see the difference.  Lights are also much whiter and don't have the yellow tint of the factory fog lamps and headlamps.Overall I am very satisfied with the lights and recommend them to all Super Duty owners!

Just finished install with fp3 fuel pack Vance & Hines. After I fought with lame instructions from K&N. Figured it out on my own.2013 Wide Glide....feels like about 10 hp with the tune. Can sure feel the torque and nice super suck sound too. This by it self was just ok. After the auto tune was finished it came on nice. It could use some porting at the throttle body to rubber inlet. This should be easy by plugging up the butterfly opening with shop towel and some tape. Will use a dermal tool to make a better throat into the  throttle body. As it is. There is a lip on the inlet side of things. This will cut down air flow and make interference and turbulence. Mis-match is not good in this airstream. Im a machinist and would not want to make this sound like a walk in the park. You better have some mad skills with this extra mod. I used to build Turbo Supras. The entire stock throttle body inlet needs to be polished and ported.

I installed the radiator last night with no problems. Looks identical to the original radiator I replaced with the exception of the color of the plastic. To me the quality is better than other more expensive after market radiators. My friend that is a mechanic recommended Denso as the best replacement to go with.

This leather milk is an awesome conditioner for your leather goods. It came wih a nice round  that sorta looks like a buffing pad this is an awesome product to use on your leather seats or any other leather goods you may have. You cannot go wrong with this product.  It has a nice almond or sort of nutty smell to it.  I actually used this for my leather car seats which take on a lot of wear and tear.  I was very happy to find that it made the seats look and feel new again.  I am very happy that I have finally found a product for my leather seats because they were looking very dull and old.  I did receive this product at a lower cost for my honest unbiased review.  And I must say that I will be using this product on all of my leather goods now that I have had the opportunity to try it.

Perfect for my application. Adhesive backing is a bit large (thick too) and if mounting to black or dark colored surface some trim with a razor would be required.

Looks great, fits great. I have learned my lesson with ALL of these items that stick on with double sided sticky tape and I now add my own extra tape where ever I can (lost an exterior item to the wind one time). My only thought with this item is that I wish the top of it where it curves over the door sill would go a little further and curve over and downward toward the interior of thr vehicle about a 1/2 inch. I feel like someone getting out of the vehicle could catch the exposed edge with a heel and pull it loose.

This actually worked much better than expected. I say this because there is very little info to be found online about this little product. Apparently, it is actually a newer version of the third brake light relocation bracket that was adapted to also hold the plate. You can use it for either feature or both.

This clay block became very sticky after the first use. Requires a lot of lubricant in order to slide smoothly or else it will also leave marks behind. I purchased another clay block from a local detail store and it seems to work a lot better.

This works perfect. If you don't know which gas cap you need, you shouldn't be working on your own vehicle! To further assist those of you who might need just a little help and are capable enough to work on your own vehicle, I'll point out obvious differences between the two types of gas caps. This GT330 gas cap has two triangular notches on the gas cap that ratchets in the filler neck. The older style of gas cap had has 2 threads on the gas cap that screws into the filler neck. If you're able to compare the two, if not look at the receiving threads inside the filler neck and compare in the pictures! Best of luck

This is for the PASSENGER SIDE!  The picture posted above is incorrect and shows the wrong parking light assembly, and I was slightly confused when I first viewed it.  The order came in on time, was well protected, and easy to open.  The parking light assembly comes with a bulb pre-installed, which is a nice touch.  Installation required a Phillips head screw driver and a little patience figuring out how to unclip the wiring harness from the old assembly.  From there I just plugged in the new part and aligned the new parking light into place.

I've got a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee that I've built into an off-road toy.I've installed all 3 lens types (Fog/Driving/Long Range)of these KC lightson my Jeep so I can see off-road and they are fantastic.They were easy to install with the provided directions, which be sure to readand it will make your life much easier.The switch provided didn't suite what I was trying to do since I was going to have actuallyfour total sets of lights wired in. I opted out and purchased a set of missle style switchesthat had the flip covers on them.In any case for the money, great product and I get alot of compliments with these lightsespecially off road when the other drives ask me to "Turn on the Sun so we can see!"

Remember when you used to just buy wiper blades and slide them in for $5? I miss those days. Now you have to replace the whole wiper and its holder - lots more plastic into the environment and more expensive = more money in someone elses pockets. All these changes didn't come with higher quality either. We still have to replace the wipers just as often and some are just junk - thats where these fit in too ...or don't fit in to be more accurate. Ordered the correct drivers side blade for my 2017 explorer listed in my book, the correct blade arrived arrording to the part numbers on the package, but the included adapters were wrong! I had to grind off tabs that were not supposed to be there. $17 for a wiper blade that doesnt even come with the correct adapter. The fact it doesnt even wipe away all the water (see pics) just adds insult to injury. Amazon didn't even want this product back when I returned it. SMHIt tells me to stay away from Bosh. They aren't what they used to be.

Worked fine the first few times I used it. But the depressor assembly in the fitting fell out unexpectedly and was lost. After reading other reviews here, it seems to be a common problem and a design defect. I contacted the manufacturer and they refused to fix the issue, instead they want me to purchase a pack of 5 replacement depressor assemblies.If they aren't going to fix the design defect, they should at least include a few extra parts with the kit, and include a note with a warning about this issue. Had I known that there was poor retention on the part, I may have been able to avoid this issue.

I have tried all the Meguairs vinyl trim protectants.  It is unrivaled in durability, shine and deep dark color when compared to all the other Meguair products. This goes on like like a clear gloss spray paint.  Do not rub after applying because it will smear and mess up the even shine.It should be reserved for specific parts of the car with certain criteria to get the maximum benefit, such as the honey comb engine  grills on front that would require you sticking a rag in each hole (50+ holes!) or the odd plastic and rubber shapes engine bay. It does these areas in record time.For the rest of the car interior and gaskets need a quick clean and condition with low shine I use Meguiars quick detailer wipes.I highly recommend a vinyl trim cleaner Meguairs M39 to prep the surface for maximum adhesion which equals extended life. I get two months or more before it starts to wear down.This combo of products make the car look brand new.

Amazing brightness, almost too much brightness. I used it up in the mountains, It lights up the whole night sky, and you can see so much farther. Just be careful to angle the unit correctly, you do not want to use it on a two lane highway with oncoming cars, it will blind them. Use it ONLY when no cars are coming toward you.

I would prefer to give 4.5 stars. Installed on my '96 KLR 650. I've done a lot of motorcycle riding in the cold, below and above freezing. Invariably my hands always got too cold. So after doing some research these heaters stuck out to me. I would be able to keep my original grips that I like instead of replacing it like many other heated grips force you to do. But that being said, there was a lot of work involved in installing this. This doesn't bother me though because as some have said that if you want to do it right you power directly from the battery and use a relay to keep it from draining the battery when the bike is turned off. All in all, being careful and soldering as much as possible to prevent voltage drops, it took me about 2 to 2.5 hrs to install. I did wrap the clutch bar in electrical tape and didn't use the heat shrink tube they sent because it still spun freely after being shrunk. To fit the grips over them I used rubbing alcohol which lubed them up good and I was able to slip them right on no problem. But I did have to wait a few hours to dry.-Update-:I still can't live without them. I did have some issues with them, in my first review I mentioned above how the low setting didn't seem to warm up very much, that was because I had plugged the wires into the wrong position on the rocker. Pay very close attention to the installation instructions, there was one graphic that I didn't look at close enough for the wiring diagram and it wasn't super clear on how it goes together. It actually made my Progrips melt onto my gloves on high heat! So yeah, I fixed that, bought a new set of warmers and grips and installed it. Again, for reasons still unknown to me a couple months later I started getting melted grips again. This time I caught it before I had to replace the warmers too and quickly got to diagnosing the issue. I think the end issue was that my voltage regulator wasn't playing nice with them. Since there is no limit on how high the voltage can go they were being severely overpowered. So now, months later, it is the beginning of fall and I am finding it is time to start using them again. I have replaced my voltage regulator so I am hoping that now the high heat will play nice. But I am also going to pay close attention to how hot it gets and not wear too thick of gloves so I don't melt anything anymore. Yeah, its a hassle, but I don't want to pay for any more experiments. All in all I am pleased with them, I used them a lot last winter, and I plan on using them a lot this winter.  Would I buy them again? Yeah, I would like to sell my KLR eventually and get a sport bike. When that day comes I will probably buy another kit and install it on that too. Next time I would diagnose my electrical on the bike first to make sure its stable.Performance wise the high heat setting is very impressive. I also installed some Kolpin handlebar mitts to help retain heat and block wind chill. My commute to work is about 35-40 minutes at freeway speeds. The coldest I have driven in so far is 22 deg F and I have to turn the heaters off about half way through my commute and they stay warm enough until I get to work. This to me means that I should be able to take them to much lower temps without any problems. However, my only gripe about them is that the low setting is very very low. Like almost nothing. I can deal with it because at least the high setting is nice and toasty, but it would be nice if the low setting put out a bit more power. I'm not sure if this is a wiring issue or if it has to do with the switch. But I am going to look into it.Update 3 years later: So the makers of this kit did a redesign of the switch and the replacement works great! I am still using the original heating elements (the ones I installed after my mishap). They still work great and I anticipate using them for much longer!

Ive used this for a number of years...I have had it on two different trucks now. the first was the bed liner for a 95 chev and it lasted pretty good for about 5 years before I sold the vehicle. I have just finished doing the bed of a 2006 f250 8ft bed and also the outside of the wheel fenders and rocker panels.  Some of the problems you will run into is making sure you sand down the paint well and use Acetone to wipe off the area for prepping the surface. this will help it from fish-eying when applying. The other issue is that it will dull out pretty quick in the sun. After contacting the manufacturer about this, I was told any polyurethane is compatible to put over the top. I used a polyurethane clear coat brush on spar varnish that has UV protectant in it...it takes that stuff about 3 days to dry though. Spar varnish is an exterior polyurethane that flex's with temps and sun...took about a half a quart to do the sides of my truck with it...As far as the price I got it on sale for 65bucks at a farm fleet store and purchased two kits with rollers and scuff pad....you can do this yourself and save a bundle.

So far the installation was easy on my 2003 chevy tahoe. I haven't ran it for more than a minute or two though. It is definitely bright as hell. It puts my high beams to shame. When I have my high beams on and then turn on the light bar it completely overpowers them to the point of they do absolutely nothing. I took my time installing them because I didn't want to have a bunch of wires under the hood looking like they didn't belong there. The light is actually much brighter than it appears in the picture. I mounted mine where my top gill was hoping to keep out any extra moisture so that it will prolong the life of it. I have the 32 inch bar. I'm giving it 4 stars for now. If I have any problems with it I will drop it lower. If I don't have any problems in 6 months I will move it to 5 stars. I did notice a couple of flaws on the body which were really small and obviously came from when the body was casted but nothing that would hurt the performance or function of it. Plus they were on the back anyways and how I have it mounted it wouldn't be seen anyways. Plus unless you are looking for them you wouldn't notice them either.

This kit is very simple and I like that it uses all the stock bits. The written instructions are so wrong they're funny....but they do have an EXCELLENT install video. I watched it 3 or 4 times, walked outside, and about an hour and a half I was out riding. Really cleans up the rear end. There's a few others out there but they either have a plastic base (this is metal) or they are almost the same thing but cost 2X as much.Very happy with mine :)

Great price and looks pretty damn good combined with the rear bumper. I would recommend buying the package; you'll get a better deal if you buy the combo. I've had these bumpers for the whole Minnesota winter and it's started to rust heavily inside. The hitch is rusting and some of the welds. This bumper has held up to some good abuse. I have a winch on the front and i use the hooks on the rear bumper to pull people out or to be pulled out. The overall design is great, i feel the brush guards will protect the winch and fenders well. In an impact it should crumple on the edges from the sideways v cuts.

Ok first off the pros...1. Material is top notch.2. The covers all fit nice and tight.3. The camo is exactly as pictured. Now for the cons....1. Some of the covers have velcro attachment points and straps sewn in. Some of the other covers do no. The ones that do not have velcro, they are attached to the seats with cheap material sewn into tabs. You must tie a piece of nylon rope to the tabs and pull them tight and tie them. I did not pull on these too hard, as they seem like they will pull out of the covers. For the money I paid for these seat covers, I feel that they should have had velcro on ALL of the attachment points. As the velcro is much, much more stronger than these cheap little fabric tabs. If they were going to use these tabs, atleast use some heavy duty stuff or add a little more material and reinforce the attachment point area and put in grommets. Attached are pictures of the velcro and tabs for comparison.2. The console cover is a waste. I got the bottom cover on only to find that the extra material caused the bottom lid/seat to bind and not close properly. I tried 3 different ways to install, and the lid would not close properly. So I did not even install the console cover. There are no instructions on installing the console cover.3. The back seat. If you are not mechanically inclined, DO NOT purchase the back seat cover. There are no instructions for installing on the back seat. And in order to properly install the seat back cover nice and tight, you MUST remove the back seat. I messed with the back seat cover for about 45 minutes, before I broke out the socket set and just removed it. The tab and string attachment makes installing it with the seat installed, impossible. You will never get it tight. This is where the velcro attachment would have came in handy. This would allow for install with out seat removal. The reason you have to remove the seat, is in order to tie the lateral rope, you MUST get behind the seat. And you cannot with out removing the seat. If you purchase this, and have the 2007-2012 extended cab, the back seat rest has 3 large tabs that slide vertically into loops on the back of the cab. These tabs on the seat, have nylon inserts to allow for smooth back seat lifting operation. When you remove the seats, you must lift the entire assembly straight up to disengage the slide tabs. If you pull on it prior to lifting it up, you will break the nylon inserts. I know, I broke 2 of them. Again, if some kind of instructions would have came with the rear seat covers, it would have been very helpful. As big as a pain in the butt installing these rear seat covers were, I just hope the cheap little fabric tabs do not rip out of the fabric. As that will require removal of the back seat once more.4. The front seat back covers have a velcro seam up almost the entire length on the side. Which I like. However, this needs redesigned so that the velcro overlap points to the rear of the vehicle. Right now, the opening/overlap faces the front of the vehicle and is unsightly. And I think that once the seat covers are broken in and loosen up a little, the hook portion of the velcro will be rubbing on clothing and on bare skin on ones arms. If there would have been detailed instructions for the console and back seat, velcro attachments vs. the fabric tabs and nylon rope, and the front seat back cover velcro issue, I would have given these seat covers 5 stars. Overall, decent seat covers, just expected more than what they are. These seat covers need a few tweeks by the manufacturer, especially for the amount of money these cost.

These lights look really good. I bought the 9W Black Case ones. I installed 10 on each side of my lower grille area on my 2012 Dodge Durango. They fit perfect in the honeycomb type grille. I was pleased at how custom they look when they're off and on. They might not be 9W (I didn't measure the wattage) but they look nice and bright driving down the street! Each of the 20 lights worked perfect right out of the package. I was trying to figure out just the right DRL setup for my Durango & I think this nailed it! Like I said I didn't measure the wattage but they look bright to the eye. I liked these so much this is the first time I sent in a review with photos attached. I don't think they will throw the light the fog lights do but they look great as DRLs!

I like this, but ill have to admit, the material is very thin. When I opened, it had a odor, and i cant put on my car until i air this out. Very much like chemicals. the tops came sewn onto the seat pieces, i am assuming this was just for shipping, but i have to cut it off. I don't think I will be using them anyway since they are a bit small. I am putting this on my Saturn VUE. Its a very nice neutral color, and the steering wheel cover will be used,since it seems to definitely be sturdy enough.

Update 5-16-17 It's rusting through already! I gave it two good coats of epoxy before I installed and it still has bubbled and rusted. Pay the extra $100 a get a Thule or Yakima.After I assembled it, I used sealant to plug all the openings to keep moisture from rusting the inside. Then put a coat of epoxy paint to seal the outside. Used u-bolts to attach it to my ladder rack.

So I recently bought an 09 Yamaha R6 after my last one was stolen. First thing I did with the new one was shop for some shorty levers. After coming across these, I was very intrigued because of the good reviews and good looking design, but they didn't have a color to match my bike (my bike is orange and my old levers were black with an orange adjuster). I messaged the seller and was helped by Jessica. She basically told me that they had no problem assembling me a pair of levers from scratch, and adding the black adjuster to the black lever (they didn't have orange unfortunately), rather than the red adjuster that it's supposed to have, but I'd have to order directly from the seller rather than an Amazon warehouse, therefore the shipping would take longer. I had no problem with that so we proceeded. I waited about a week and half before they finally got to my door, and what do you know, the adjusters were still red. I was initially very irritated and ready to return them, but I emailed Jessica and told her what happened and she immediately had a pair of black adjusters shipped to me for free from a California warehouse. They took about 3 days to get to my door, and I was able to swap the adjusters myself. Should've easily be a 5 star review, but I decided to give 4 stars because of the mess up and 2 week turn time.After all said and done, the levers themselves are surprisingly very nice, better than the last Amazon pair I bought for my last bike (I think the brand was RideIt). The customer service was great thanks to Jessica. Will definitely be recommending these to some riding buds.

Installed in my 2009 Honda Fit Sport. They look great and are a super improvement! Can't speak to longevity as of yet, because they are pretty new. The quality and construction seems on point, though.

First thing I had to do was let these sit outside for several days. They smelled terrible like plastic and I didn't want my vehicle smelling like that. Originally I bought these for my 2008 F150 however I didn't realize I would need to remove the back of the back seat to hook it around the seat. So I ended up taking them off the front seats and putting them in my wifes 2007 Ford Focus.The car seat covers are ok quailty. They top parts are of thin foam and the sides are very thin type of nylon.  The parts you sit on are a thicker type of cloth that isn't stretchy like the sides or backs of the front seats. I will post some pictures of the front seats installed on my F150. They did fit the seats good but the head rest covers are too small for it and for the little Ford focus head rests also. When pulling the seat covers on the seams ended up tearing a little if you pulled too hard. You can see the one head rest ripped pulling it on the F150.The back seat cover was wide enough to fit the F150's back seat but I didn't want to unbolt the back seat to install it (mine don't fold down. Also the backseat bottom covers need something to hook the elastic band onto which my seats flip up and I had no way to hook them onto any metal on the seat as the bottoms are carpeted.I installed them on the 2007 Ford Focus. Everything fit a lot better except the back seat again. The back seat does fold down in the car, they are 60/40. The problems with the back seat covers are that the cover is almost too big for that back seat. I had to pull more of the cover to one side then the other so that the zippers lined up with the seat where it folds down. Next I  ran into was the buckle strap. They are cheaply made and kept pulling apart when trying to tighten them up I ended up adjust the straps then pulling both ends and snapping the buckle. I'm not sure they will stay buckled but it held. Having the bottom seat flip forward made the bottom super easy to install. Again the head rest covers weren't really big enough for her front seat headrests either.They are air bag compatible and have Velcro sides in the front seats. I wouldn't use these if you have cooling seats but heated seats would be fine. They are not water proof or water resistant. The seat belt sleeves are soft and well made. The steering wheel cover is loose on the Focus' steering wheel and has cheap vinyl around the inside edge. My experience with these is that they become brittle due to the sun from the windshield and end up cracking and not being comfortable. I had to remove stars due to the quality of the sides, they are made of nylon and the elastic bands that hold them in place are thin. Also the head rests didn't fit completely over any head rest I tried them on. Universal fit is like one size fits all.I will post some pictures of them installed on the front seats of my 2008 F-150 with power leather package. Also posting pictures of them installed on the 2007 Focus sedan. I'm hoping the material and elastic bands hold up. Overall they are a cheaper seat covers but the front seat covers fit really nice. With seat covers you get what you pay for. With 3 kids and 3 dogs we needed something to help prolong our seat life. I would look elsewhere if you need water resistant for wet dog paws to protect your leather. But Cloth seats they will dry and helps keep mud and dirt off your seats. I was able to purchase these for a discount in exchange for my honest review of the seat covers.

This filter fit perfectly in my 2010 Honda Accord.It was very easy to install(instructions on the back of the box) and much cheaper than having the dealership change it out. Also, it seemed to be of the same quality as the original Honda filter I replaced. After changing both the engine and cabin air filter the AC ran a lot cooler!

These flares worked out great. Have a 2005 RAM 1500 with rot around the wheel arches. It's a construction site vehicle, ending its life working behind a fence. But, it has to look decent.  These flares hid the rot and a little spray on bedliner along the rocker panels made it look like a different truck. The attached photos have the company door signs obscured.

Last time I replaced the cabin air filter (3 years ago) I bought an OEM filter from the dealer (can't remember how much it was). It crossed my mind the other day, so I took it out and it is now black, had bird feathers and leaves in it!I decided to try this FRAM CF10132 cabin air filter and it's a perfect fit! It has about 10 more pleats/folds than the OEM filter, is more rigid, and overall feel of higher quality. There's no significant improvement or decline in air flow from what I can tell, but I guess there's more air flow now (relative, since I had so much junk in my old filter) - but I can't prove it. However, my mind is at ease now, knowing I'm not breathing in air filtered through old leaves and bird feathers!

Great lights and a great customer service from Xprite. I had gotten the half halos at first but I could make them to do what I wanted (keep halos and headlights on at the same time. After calling customer service, Xprite made it easy to exchange them for theseXprite 7" Inch Round 80W 9000. I also bought the fog lights withe amber helos. Installation was easy and they company was able to explain how to connect them in order to do what I wanted.Here is what I was able to accomplish with some creative wiring:icture #1: lights on Auto during day time - White Halos only onPicture #2: when are set to parking lights - Amber Halos, fog light halos, side markers and signal lights onPicture #3: When lights are set to on, low beam, amber halos,fog light halos, side markers and signal lights on...regular signal light flashes for turnPicture #4: Lights one and fogs on.

Take your time, use a sharp blade and it will look like it's factory made.My truck looks great, almost impossible to tell its a wrap and not a factory black bow tie.I have gone through the car wash (not laser touch less--it had the spinning washer things) multiple times and still looks perfect.

I installed this Poweraid 300-637 on a 2013 rubicon it took about 7min simple install glad I did because three of the original bolts holding theThrottle body on were loose from the factory I bought this jeep bran new :-oThe spacer was what I expected, response time and torque are defiantly better. I noticed a slight tone difference on a hard acceleration after installing the spacer but, I have already installed the K&N intake and the red rock duel outlet cat back muffler. This set up sounds perfectly tuned it is not over done with loudness. I highly recommend this product along with the other intake and exhaust upgrades I've done but only if you want to completely change the way your stock jeep sounds he he. It will convert it to a mean sounding machine with excellent response low mid and high end performance.

This pad is smaller by about a quarter inch. I bought this for a rear replacement brake pads on a 2008 Acura TL-S. I purchased back in May with the promotion and cannot return it any more since I found out today when installing. Wagner also denied my rebate and said it was invalid with no response when I emailed them.I used wagner on my other cars and have not had a problem in the past. I unfortunately will not buy this brand anymore.I attached pics. Pad  that is marked RR is the orginal pad.

Bought this and installed it on a 2004 Sonoma ZR5 CC. Running a 31x10.5/15 with minimal cutting and almost zero rubbing. Truck drives like factory and finally looks half way decent. Did end up replacing sway bar bushings and an ABS sensor but no big deal. Overall looks and preforms nicely. Worth the money and it won't break you.

Replace your original filter with a K&N filter and get better fuel economy. For use in my car, this air filter will pay for itself after about 1 year (with the average commute of 12,000 miles per year). This air filter is also washable and reusable which is definitely a plus compared to the regular white filters which have to be disposed every time you change them.

I was in a hurry to get out of the car and pulled the handle just as I was turning the keys off.  The timing is critical.  The handle will normaly unlock the door if it's locked and you pull it, but if you manage to pull the handle while your unlocking (thanks auto unlock) you can break an inside part of the handle, and then it doesn't feel like it will open anymore.However, you can pull the handle like normal, even though it doesn't open and then pull the unlock a little farther than normal and you can still get your door to open without having to roll down the window.To replace take out 4 screws in the interior door panel to remove it: one on door latch side, one on bottom middle of panel, one in the arm rest under the rubber pad, and one in the lock trim ring (use a knife or fingernail file to pop off the screw cover.)I used a set off nylon trim tools to pop the interior panel off, then took out one hex head screw to remove old lock, installed new and put it back together.Good as new, repair time less than one hour.

Installed on 2009 Civic EX Sedan. Two upfront and one in the rear of the interior. These are bright and will light up the interior. Nice bright white light and it eliminates almost any chance of shadows inside the car. The Civic has a timer to dim the interior lights and the lights do make a slight noise when dimming before turning off. I do recommend if you want bright lights.The picture taken was during the day and there is noticeable difference.

Good little tach, the shift indicator is a little loose and very easy to move which means it moves on its own a little. Comes with what you would need to mount this to your dash with a bracket. Same bracket you would use to hose clamp it to the steering column. The housing is plastic. Works great which is what I needed! I had to make my own little bracket to mount it to the gauge panel that I built, no biggie.

This lights are not quite a direct fit. You need to modify or make the opening larger in order to fit it in the housing. Also you need to connect a ground wire to the bulb base. None the less the lights give out not an Amber color light but a yellow/green color. Fairly bright. Good accent for any European vehicle.

This thing didn't disappoint.  I have used it many times and compared it to ramps my friends have.  I think this is as good or better than theirs.  It's light, it's solid, and the slope is perfect for me.  I load my XR200R and XR250R in my Mazda B3000 4x4 by myself without a step and without jumping into the back of the truck.  The only drawback I see with this ramp is that the hole edges are slightly sharp if you stick your fingers in them.  I haven't been cut or anything but you can tell that's not a place to grab.  You won't be disappointed with this.

The kit does NOT include the Hand-charged dual LED flashlight as described.  It came with a very cheap aluminum flashlight that takes 3-AAA batteries.  Other than that it appears to be okay.  Since it only just arrived no opinion can be formed as to the usefulness of the rest of the kit.  Note: the fault is with Amazon's description, not AAA.

Thought it was going to work well but it failed. I used it on my ATV 2" receiver to hold the spare tire mount from moving.  I snugged it down tight and after a few dirt road trips, I found it loose so I tightened it back up.  After a couple more, it was loose again so i was going to put a second lock washer on to better hold it.  When I took it off, the threads were destroyed from bouncing around.  I made the mistake of thinking there might be a couple good threads so I put it back on but it wouldn't tighten and then it wouldn't come off.  I had to saws all the bolt to remove it.  This my not have happened if it was a hardened steel pin but if it would have - I would have never sawed it out either.  I wish there was another way.  If I was going to keep it on the street, I wouldn't need one anyway.

Got these for my 2007 Infiniti G35x 4-Door. Had them professionals installed at an auto body shop. At first they felt "sticky" but after a couple days of regular driving, absolutely no problems. No squeaking, and feel smooth to break. They also give the car a better look. Definitely considering a rear set when its time to replace those.

Nice looking and sturdy mirrors but insufficient packaging. The plastic housing on the left mirror had 2 small gouges, probably from the threaded end of the other mirror. So tightly packaged that I had to tear the box apart to get them out because they would not slide out the end of box. I think if the threaded ends would have had a soft plastic cover over them, it would have solved the problem and only would have added .02 cents to the cost. Only a 1/4" of bubble wrap separated the 2 mirrors which is not enough considering how tightly packed they were. I was only able to post one picture so I posted a pic comparing the new with the stock mirror. As you are facing the bike, the mirror on the left is the new mirror and sits almost even with the handlebar end. The factory mirror sticks past the bar end about 3". I wanted something narrower because i move bike in and out of a 3' doorway and got tired of bumping my mirrors on the door jams. I wasn't expected these to be this much narrower so only time will tell if I like it or not for seeing behind me. I can't put the other mirrow on yet because these new mirrors are both right-hand threaded and my bike has a left-handed thread on the left side (non throttle side) like the yamahas. I knew this, and am waiting for the right-hand threaded mirror mount which I also ordered from amazon. As others have mentioned, these mirrors are super tight and should not have a problem with them moving even on bumpy roads and trails. I have these mounted on a 2017 Zero DSR.

While I only have had installed for a week so far so good, takes a little bit of time getting the "on" temp set correctly but once it's set it's Good to go. I placed the temp sending unit into the upper rad hose via a nifty little hose splice with 1/8 NPT hole and thread already pre drilled. Time will tell how long it lasts, I will update if and when problems arise.

I read a lot of reviews and decided to gamble the $50 something for the 20" bar. Shipping went well. Got it towards the end of the expected dates bit I think that's my local delivery fault not the sender. I've had the bar for about 3 months now and have had no water issues like some of the lessor reviews tell. But I can see how theirs got water. The seal isn't what I would call superb, but that being said anyone with any technical ability would be able to solve the issue quite quickly.Another fault u see is the mount setup. Many of the reviews also complain about this. If your mounting to a bar that the lower center bolt is going all the way through, say a bull bar or light rack, it'll be fine. However if you mount into something like the bumper, which I did, good luck, it was hard to center and keep aligned while I torqued it down. I'm not to worried about it though seeing as it gets mounted once and not moved all the time.The output is great. On my bumper it does a great job of lighting everything up, except far out in front, but I light up stop signs a mile out. Can't complain.All in all I've never spent $50 better. I love the bar and plan on ordering more.

Easy to install. All necessary parts included. Recommend watching the video on Curt site just to avoid any surprises. You don't need to remove any of the exhaust components. Also the directions say to leave off the two trim pieces you need to remove for installation. You actually can reinstall the passenger one no problem and the one on the driver side with a bit of trimming as pictured. I used tin snips. The actual hitch tube on this one is about 3/4" longer than the other hitches on the market and that may make a difference for a bike rack as this hitch is still recessed under the bumper. tools are straight and phillips head screwdrivers to remove the two trim pieces. ratchet with an 8-10" extension. The bolts are either 17 or 19 mm but I used an 11/16 or 3/4 socket. 20 minutes start to finish. No jacks necessary. You may want to enlist a buddy to help hold it in place to start the bolts. I did it myself but it was a bit of a workout.

2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Bought it for the SRS capability. Sadly that function won't work for me. After speaking with the manufacturer, they tell me there are 2 versions of this unit. One made for the US market, one for the foreign market. Hard drives inside unit are different. Lower price is foreign market, higher price is US market. Needless to say they cannot give me the US software for the unit I purchased here on AMAZON as they are not compatible. Very disappointed. At least it does read ABS as advertised.

My First modular Helmet here for me. I like everyone else who was looking at the Shoie Neotec for $600. I had started to look at other options that led me to this Lid. $200 Lid + $10 HJC chin guard + the free foam that came in the box equals to a very decsent helmet. I cut out the foam to size so I could fill the area where the speakers would sit or the pocket  where your ear would be in your helmet. Noise level is good, sun shade is great fit and finish is equal to other higher level brands. I wear a large Shoie GT Air and a Large Scorpion EXO. I wear a Large Bell Rogue helmet. I have a round head. This helmet fits me well. I hope this helps with your choice of whatever brand and style you pick. We purchased this same Lid for my wife and she wears a size small with all her helmets. This helmet feels tight on her cheeck bone area but slightly loose everywhere. She isGoing to keep it because she wears a helmet sock which should fill in the gaps in her lid.

Honestly the worst brake pads I have ever owned. Lasted less then 20,000 miles on my 2013 Honda Accord. Extremely dirty, wheels were always covered in break dust.The only reason I replaced my Stock Pads at 48,000 miles was because they were noisy, still could have easily gotten another 30-40k miles out of them.Maybe I got a bad set, but I have never had brakes wear out so quickly, and be so dirty. I replaced with Autozone Specials and they are cleaner and quieter then these ever were.

All measurements are from center of holes.  I had to redrill one hole, and add a few washers to fit my bike.  (Happens with every universal product, so not a flaw with these)  Also I bought bar end screws at the hardware store.  Wasn't hard to figure out, and they block the wind perfectly on ninja 300.  Without these no matter what gloves I wore, fingers would freeze if it was under 40.  Now I wear my light gloves and hands stay warm in the 30's.  Haven't ridden colder than that, but these serve that purpose.  I also painted the inside black because I like the look better.  They come tinted brown.  Spray canned the inside and they show black from the outside.  Peeled off reflector stickers because it didn't look right with my bike.  Easy to mount if you are moderately handy, and great for the price.

I did not buy these from Amazon because I was able to get them much cheaper on eBay, but I did read all the Amazon reviews here prior to buying.  I had the benefit of a detailed forum post by someone with the exact same Mazda3 sedan as I had for tips on how and where to install the LED Daylight 4's.  That made it much easier to do.  I originally wanted to have the DRLs go off when my headlights turned on and connected the third wire as instructed.  This caused a number of quirks with other electronics like the left turn signal flashing very quickly, then the hazards coming on instead of the headlights, then the auto-up and down feature of the driver's window not working.  I called Philips for a replacement wire box that had an additional wire that is supposed to get rid of these quirks.  The box was never sent to me.  I simply disconnected the third wire that was causing the trouble and just have the DRLs on day and night with headlights on.  My only concern was with the DRLs being too bright or illegal at night (I am in Florida), but having carefully observed many other cars, they also have LED DRLs on at night with their headlights and these Philips ones are no brighter than those.  So as long as you do not mind leaving them on day and night, they work very well.

Made the mistake of going cheap and buying the Echo. Dumb move. This buckle is in another league compared to the other. Heavy quality metal and you can actually buckle it with your gloves on.Installed pretty easily. I cut my D-rings off because I didn't want to hear the rattle. Like the slider that holds the loose excess strap from flapping. Plus this thing looks freaking cool.Don't bother researching the other guys. Just buy this one. You won't find a better one. It's THAT GOOD, honest.

**UPDATE - DON'T BUY THESE!  LESS THAN A YEAR LATER, THE PAINT IS STRIPPING RIGHT OFF. NOW, THESE ARE PERMANENTLY AFFIXED TO MY NEW EPXLORER AND ARE PEELING. I'M TOTALLY PISSED. are a lot better than expected. Heavy duty, 3D, metal, flat black! They come individually, so the thought of getting the placement & alignment right made me a little nervous. Also, when I peeled them from the wax paper they were adhered to, the adhesive on the back of the letters didn't feel strong at all. I went out to the car, planned on where I was going to place the letters & the spacing and cleaned the surface with some windex. I started with the L & O in the middle, which align well with the Ford logo on the grille, then just placed the remaining letters by eyeballing them. They came out perfect first time around and it literally took under 5 minutes. They also adhered so much stronger than i thought they would. I couldn't peel them off without heat if I tried. To finish it off, I ran a heat gun over the letters and gave them a final press. They are rock solid!

Advertised as a Walker part and shipped from Amazon, but NOT a Walker part.  A brand called Exhaust Mate, made in India.  It may do the job, but the product is not as advertised.  I have found that quality rubber made in the USA, Europe, Japan and Canada far outlasts the stuff made in China or India.  I have made the mistake of buying Chinese and Indian made tires, only to watch them dry rot within 15 months - something I have never had happen with Michelins, Bridestones or Continentals.  May end up using my 22 year old OEM Nissan Japanese made rubber hangers instead, depending upon their condition.

Worked fine for me. Used to put back on my rear 17" tire. Tip for those who are breaking these, watch a youtube how too! When putting a tire back on you have to keep making sure the other side of the tire's bead isn't in place, push it back down to the middle of the rim, this will make it much easier to get the other side of the tire on the rim and reduce the force needed to do so. Would be nicer if it were a set of 3 and not 2 but I was able to make it work and they prevented damage to my rim!!!

Used this product on the underside of an ETS top mount intercooler on my 2013 Subaru Sti.  Very satisfied with the workability of the product applying it to multiple angles and radius'.  Adhesive has held well in the 3 months since installation.

Westin must have fixed the bracket issue. They were all labeled correctly. Took about 2 hours with 2 people and we were taking our time. They look great and our very stable. I'm 200 lbs and they do not flex or move.

I've been using this for 4 years now and I couldn't be happier.  This is a quality compression tester.  This kit has all of the adapters that I have ever needed.You don't even need a pen or paper to record all of your pressure readings.  With this tool you can pick which cylinder you are testing and it will save the readings as you cycle through the rest of the cylinders.  Then when you are done you can cycle through all of the readings.This set comes in a high quality case, this kit should last a lifetime.

Installed on a 2002 F150 reg cab long bed FX4 Ford. My factory Rancho 5000 shocks could not handle the tongue weight of the 24 foot camper I pull. It put my truck at an overloaded angle and was like a bad boat ride when pulling. These Monroes are awesome they made my trucks hitch angle raise up  to a leveled stance now and it sucks up  bumps without the violent boat ride effect. I highly recommend these for people who pull campers, car trailers, or any heavy loaded trailer to  help counter the load for a safe and smooth ride.

These light have been installed in my rv as a replacement to the originals from 1989. The LED lights are bright and liven up the interior of the RV. Each of the three lights took approx. 3 minutes each to install and work great with the wall switch. I gave only four stars because the product color shown in the photos are not the same as what I received. Instead of the bright white, the lights I have are a cream color. The reason for ordering these was to update from the cream color. :/I will purchase more in the future and recommend to others because of the quality and efficiency of this product.This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.

Replaced OEM fronts on my wife's minivan (2007 Honda Odyssey) in the summer of 2010. Don't have any problems. Stopping power is probably the same as with the original pads. At least I did not notice any difference. Not as dusty as OEM, but not "dustless". Dust is reasonably light in color. Quiet. Was afraid that they may be not as responsive as OEM while the rotors are cold, but surprisingly this is not the case. Stopping is smooth and even through the entire range of applied pressure. Basically these brakes don't bite at the beginning and then fade when you apply more pressure. Or wise versa - don't stop at the beginning and then unpredictably bite when more pressure applied. Installed them with Centric Parts 121.40064 C-Tek Standard Brake Rotor. Overall I am satisfied and planning to get Akebono for my MB when the time comes.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Akebono-ACT1089-ProACT-Ultra-Premium-Ceramic-Brake-Pad-Set/dp/B000EQ0O7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Akebono ACT1089 ProACT Ultra-Premium Ceramic Brake Pad Set</a>=======Update August 2012: so far so good, cannot complain two years later (after initial installation), they still stop the car just like the first day when I installed them.  We probably put on more than 12,000 miles the last year, but I wouldn't be able to tell exact mileage. Some dust accumulates on the front discs but it's not as bad and as dark as from original brakes. Easy to clean up.No complains so far.=======Update June 2013: Cannot complain another year later. Another 12,000 miles. They are on the car for 3 years now.=======June 2014: I am not sure about exact number of miles, but judging by the service records it's about ~19,000 miles since the last update. At this point they are on the car for ~65,000 miles. The pads are still approximately 5 mm thick, but at this point looks like front disks are a little warp and develop vibration under certain braking conditions. Vibration doesn't happen every time I hit the brakes. Usually when car is rolling down hill at high speed and brakes are not heavily applied. I am planning to change my disks and I will replace the pads at the same time. I will replace them with the same brand/model pads.=======Update July 2016Replaced pads on both axles. Installed the same pads. They served me 6 years front and 5 years rear. With 12 to 15 K miles every year I cannot complain. I did switch to a different rotor model. This time I Installed Centric Parts 120.40064 Premium Brake Rotor with E-Coating and Centric Parts 120.40065 Premium Brake Rotor with E-CoatingI attached picture to display ware compare to the new one after 6 years. One thing I noticed is that internal pad wears slower than external on both sides and even on both axles. So in my case by the time the ware indicator would start make noise I am afraid the external pad would have no material left.

If you are looking for reflective tape that blends into a black background during the day ... and provides a great reflective surface at night, this Scotchlite sheets may be the right choice for you. This package contains two 8 inch x 11 inch sheets of engineer-grade reflective sheeting.Cut into whatever shape you desire, put it on most any hard surface (even one with a slight curve), and you're set. I placed the tape on my truck's grille guard, as well as the sides of my 'Super Bumper' crash attenuator. My side-by-side comparison photos show you what it looks like in my applications. During the day, the strips I put on the forward-facing grille guard are almost invisible; matches the black glossy finish perfectly. At night, when a light source is on it, it reflects nicely. The pillar is slightly convex (bowed outward), and the Scotchlite tape had no issues, as it is very flexible. For the side caps on my rear attenuator, which are convex plastic circles, I cut out the circle shape, then made 3 pie-style cuts toward the center. This allowed the tape to provide better coverage with no huge creases/folds.Blend in during the day, and be seen at night.

The ones that I took off from my Q5 were also Philips. I can't believe the dealership is asking more than $300 just to change one bulb!! The light output is great..it is TRUE WHITE with a little touch of blue that gives a classy look. It may look a little low at first turn on but it will get brighter after you leave the lights on for about half an hour. You SHOULD change  two bulbs at the same time to make the light output equal on both sides. The package contains only one bulb so you should get two orders if you would like to change both bulbs as suggested.

This fit my RV double sink perfectly. It is plastic, and thick enough to support a lot of weight. It adds some much needed counter space (when you don't need the sink of course.) It fits inside the edge of the sink, so it will not slide around. Great investment. Highly recommended.

I have a cousin who happened to be a detective in our local police department,and I thought that this light might make a nice gift!! It was and he did like it,and here is his opinion and take about this emergency light!Quality/Use:-----------------Housing unit for the light is made out of clear plastic,which will resist breaking,and it is waterproof all around! Meaning the light can be used in all types of weather. Plug & play type operation,by plugging it into a cigarette lighter port of any vehicle. One button touch to change between all seven lighting mode! Led lights are average in brightness,yet they hardly draw in power,and tend to over live other types! This one has a 30,000 hrs operating life expectancy,however,rarely that it would last that long. Power cable is about seven feet stretch to the max,and that is not long enough if you have your plug somewhere in the middle of the car,and you might need an extension. Built in base magnets,that are not very strong,they will hold the light on top of your vehicle,however if you accidentally hit the power cable with your arm,you can easily knock down the light out of the roof of your car. Lights can be used by police,security,emergency repair,towing company,even certain construction personal.Final Thoughts:---------------------One thing would have made this light a perfect product,is having an ON/OFF direct switch,you kind of have to unplug to turn off the lights! Other than that and giving the decent quality and fair pricing,this light is for sure worth recommending to whomever is looking for an inexpensive way to have an emergency light. WORD OF CAUTION: you need to check with your local authority to see if the use of these emergency lights is legal and permitted according to your state and county laws!! As for durability and long lasting,only time and use can tell! Despite the fact that this product was a complementary test sample, I will make sure to come back and report any issues with quality in the future. Still, if you're a skeptical person and not sure whether to trust other people's reviews or not! With Amazon's 30 day return policy, you have four weeks to try it out yourself, before returning it for any reason, with no questions asked, and in most cases Amazon will pay for the return shipping, in other words, it is a win, win situation!! With that said, I hope you find my humble opinion helpful in making or breaking your buying decision.

For years I've exclusively only used EBC brakes, these work better! I had EBC Green Stuff pads with standard rotors and these brakes work way better! For the price you can not beat the stop quality. Take a look at posted user pics.**UPDATE: The brakes lasted about 30K miles, which is what I've been getting from my brakes. So they fall into typical wear. I do not track my car. I at 30K the pads were pretty warn and the rotors were warped and had heat spots. See attached photos of worn pads and rotors. I would still recommend this brake set up.

And the OEM lights just suck.  These were a vast improvement over factory bulbs, but the seal between the bulb and headlamp housing is so loose, that without modification, moisture will ABSOLUTELY get into the headlight housing especially considering the factory dust cover needs to be removed.  The bulbs wiggle and freely rotate with one finger effort even when supposedly locked in place, which means if I don't use silicone sealant I can look forward to replacing a $300+ headlight assembly when moisture gets in and fouls up the optics.  For the price, I feel that these bulbs should have better fit and seal without my resorting to hack jobs.  Other reviewers mentioned the issue but let me tell you, the problem is as bad or worse as they claim.  Nice bulbs, horrible fit.

Wow!  Im very impressed with the awesome plastic visor and the quality of the materials the product is made of and has a durable construction . It blocks out the sun's rays and keeps me from glare away from my eyes even when driving into the sun.  The easy mount makes this a one of a kind product.  Ever wonder why such things don't come as a standard option in new cars???. I will definitely be buying some for my family and friends as it is a fantastic product.  This visor is so simple to install that it takes only 5 minutes or less from opening the package and having it installed.  Its nice to have because there are a lot of situations in the morning and evening when the glare of the sun makes driving downright dangerous.  It is impressive that it blocks the sun including the UV rays. You know this is really like having an giant pair of sunglasses for your car so if you forget your sunglasses, no problem. You just pull this down, with the visor up or down and thats it.  I am very comfortable recommending this item to friends and family.  The specifications and instructions can be found on the sellers listing on Amazon.page by the picture.I have received this product in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.  Im certain that if you try this you will like it.

Worked fine on my 14 inch boat trailer tire.Don't mean to sound silly, but if the U-bolt appears to be to short......please flip the rim over! ; )Wish it would have come galvanized, since the trailer "lives" in salt water.So, I went to Lowe's and purchased a can of Rust-Oleum Galvanizing Compound in a spray can,and sprayed the rim, bolt and locking clamps.

These are great for cars that don't have much of an odor or smell, I use one a week and place it on the tab under the rear view mirror not on the vent. It releases a subtle smell that lasts a week. After a week Id move the used clip to the vent as it still has some scent left and add another new clip to the rear view mirror. This creates a nice but not overpowering smell for a whole month.

Nothing cooler than a dark visor. This fits the RF-1200 perfectly. I ordered a pinlock which fitted the face shield perfectly as well. I also bought the Tourmaster visor carrier which is a gem of a purchase. This is a beautiful visor that makes riding in the bright sun a pleasure.

While the 3M Paint Defender Door Edge Protection Film sounded like a good idea, it failed right from the start even under the conditions outlined in the instructions. Ultimately, the film is not thin and this keeps it from properly following the contours of the average door, buckling and refusing to adhere along the way. Don't waste your time on this.

This product is much smaller than I expected. It is probably about 5-6 inches long. When I'm in town, this thing works just great. However, anytime I get around two story buildings it almost instantly starts getting garbled and makes listening to the radio impossible. I would only recomend this product if you live in the city AND you don't listen to the radio a lot

At 358,000 miles on my 2001 Toyota RAV-4, my old valve cover gasket was toast.  It had a strange behavior of leaking at random.  Sometimes it would be sealed up perfectly for thousands of miles, and sometimes it would leak out all my oil in a few hundred miles.  I pulled the valve cover off and the old gasket broke apart like feta cheese.This Fel-Pro gasket was not only a perfect fit but also came in a delightful blue color instead of pragmatic black.  It is soft, supple rubber that feels like it should have no problem sealing things up.  Like a hot fart, I took a gamble on putting the engine together without using RTV.  So far it looks like it has sealed up well.

These little strip lights are very bright! I bought 4 pairs total, and all worked flawlessly out of the box. I used them to light the insides of truck tool boxes.The adhesive on the back is very sticky, I cleaned the surface to be mounted to with alcohol wipes to insure proper adhesion. The aluminum covers over the LED is a little flimsy but should do its job protecting the LED underneath.The only real problem I had was connecting the wires. I have large Italian finger  which made working with the very small wires challenging at time. The wires are the smallest I've seen, the copper wire core is only 0.010" thick!Overall these LED's work great, and would rebuy this brand for my next projects

Used this to cover 2x6 plank bed of a 14' x 77" wide cargo trailer.  The trailer was new and the OEM decking was showing normal signs of black streaks from storage outside and weathering.  Sanded entire deck with orbital sander and 80 grit paper, cleaned up and masked off the side rails, front and back.  Took 4 750ml bottles to cover the deck Perfectly!

The product itself is not bad, the install was about 3 times the cost of the product because the shocks need to come out then it needs an alignment. Here is the problem, it DOES affect the ride, it DOES affect the steering of bumps, and it DOES wear ball joints etc out quicker. My truck has 10k miles on it and has had this level kit since 500 miles. My truck needs ball joints and also has developed a few rattles completely from this level. I have ordered a set of bilstein 5100 lift shocks to replace these, wish I would have done that from the start. If you want to use these thats fine, just expect to not like the ride and wear out front end parts faster. I rate these at 2 stars because they do make my truck look great, I am on 33s and they clear with ease.

Fit and finish very good. Had problem with Nissan bolt shafts being too short to accommodate iBoard's flat washer, lock washer and nut - left off the lock washer on one bolt. You could purchase a star lock washer to make the fit. I just tightened it well and will check later. Boards are easy to clean and appearance should remain good even in the Pacific NW.

It sat outside, not even ridden, through two rain falls. It's already showing a sign of moister in one of the lights. I can't tell how moister is getting into it.Once again, I'm very disappointed. I like the profile of these lights.===============================Both of these have water damage!A pair of these were installed on my motorcycle engine guards. Already have moisture in the lens and only two months old. And for that, I'm not happy.It does light up bright and with a very good but short wire lead.These were bought from Kawell.

Awesome knobs, I believe they are metal, if not, they are a hard plastic. I've been putting this off for a long time and I should have done it sooner. Saw a lot of reviews about the notch not being where it should, mine line up perfect. The middle one does only light up half way but that's just how the car is made. Thanks for a great product!To remove the original ones, take a rag or shirt (to avoid getting teeth marks on the originals from the pliers) and grab hold of the original knob and pull really hard and they come right out.

Buy a funnel if your filler neck has a gasket on the flapper.... I've got a 2016 Ram Ecodiesel - the filler neck flap has a gasket on it so you need to be able to depress the flapper to get the stuff in the tank. Wish it had a taller spout to negate the need for a funnel.The label on the back says 16 oz treats 200 gal and then below the chart it says 1 oz per 12 gal. So someone failed math because 12 * 16 = 192, not 200.Anyway at $2.50 a fill up (approx cost of 2 oz for my 26 gal tank) it's not too bad on the wallet. Just put it in the tank for the first time so I'm hoping it does its job.Cheaper @ HotShot's website (5 bottles for $75 with free shipping -- $15 per bottle)

Purchased this Cabin air filter for my 2011 infiniti G37x Journey Coupe. The service manual for the vehicle recommends replacing the filters during every service interval, and not knowing if the previous owners did or not, I replaced them. Fitment was perfect, not a very difficult procedure to remove the glove box and surrounding panels/hardware - lots of videos on YouTube on how to replace. The filter seemed to be your typical basic paper type microfilter, no carbon or other air purification materials. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants to ensure they are breathing clean air in their vehicle.

Fit perfect and are a great upgrade to standard bulbs.  You can see in the below picture that the LED on the left is brighter than the incandescent on the right.  Time will tell how these hold up.

Never thought about writing a review until today. I like these glasses, they fit in my full face nicely and don't give that weird rainbow effect from the face cover like you do with other glasses. Anyway, they're good.. useful.. but today my black pair showed me it's true strength. As I was riding I put them hanging off my shirt ( was just going around the corner) and the air takes them for a ride... They fall on the street. I bust a b*tch and as I'm approaching I see that get ran over at like 40 mph and break apart. My heard sunk.. I was going to ride away but I said no.. I went back and what do I see.. my glasses broken in 3 PCs.. grabbed them and put them back together. They were ran over big a boat of a Camry at high speeds and survived.

This is NOT a Thermostat Housing Gasket. As stated in the Position description, it is for the Lower Inlet:Tube (unconfirmed). The correct gasket is thicker and flat, not thin and half round.It is difficult enough to acquire the correct parts when the Product Descriptions are so vague, much less the Title is incorrect. And it is very unlikely we can rely on the assumption that "This Fits Your:...........".But then with all this information stated, this just may be the correct part......... I just simply have the wrong Vehicle.

The dome assembly is excellent, both in quality and fit.  I was a bit worried about this replacement with so few reviews, but how many camper domes get replaced that are of a specific type? There always seems to be a mystery to buying replacement parts, so I took several photos for others to look at.  First, the part is an ASSEMBLY, not just a plastic dome. For my camper (2001 Four Wheel Camper Hawk), the hinge plate and lift groove were an exact replacement, and already assembled to the dome.  Raise the dome with your lift arm from the inside, go outside and on top, unscrew the old dome with 4 screws, install the new dome assembly with the same 4 screws (be sure to attach the slide-lift arm first, to make it easier), and you are simply done. The plastic dome itself is an assembly (see photo #5)--the lower shell and an upper shell that is welded to the first in a sandwich to create an "insulated" cap.  The lower shell itself is the same thickness as the original plastic dome (photo #3).  I don't know how well the doubled shells are at insulation, but it should work at least a little better than the original.  There is also a correctly-placed feature molded into the bottom part of the dome for the Fan-tastic Fan--a knob that pushes down on the safety switch, preventing the fan from operating when the dome is completely shut.  It is in the exact correct location when the dome is down (photo #7).  I checked:  The fan will not operate due to the switch being depressed (good) and will operate after the dome is cracked open about 1/2" (also good).  There is another knob there that sticks down from the bottom on the inside corner that is NOT on the 2001 FWC Hawk (Photo #3).  I suspect it is there to depress another model fan switch.  No big deal--it doesn't interfere with the fan on mine. If it did, I think I could have sawed it off easily.  The darkness of the plastic doesn't mean it is opaque.  Rather, it is still transparent, sort of like dark sunglasses.  See 7th photo for a shot of looking up at the sky on a clear Arizona afternoon.

The instructions were fairly straightforward. Nice that the T45 wrench was included. I kept hearing a snap/pop after install on my 2017 1500 and all I can say is good thing for the mylar stickers. I had to remove the plastic guard/spacer so it would stop binding up against the shock.Any thoughts?

I bought one via an online rv website. This unit is very quite, all the noise comes from the actual air flow, I installed mine in a older 40foot yacht as an a.c./heat for the common area. Opening the box, this thing is abosulte monster sized, bigger than I expected, but it works well and draws less amps than they advertised. If you shop around you can find better prices, mine was $741 shipped with the lower plenum and control unit Atwood item 15021 and Atwood 15026. But shop around, this isn't always the cheapest place, since I got both pieces with $128 shipping and it was still several hundred dollars cheaper than here.

Honestly not what i expected for the projector beam area. Basically only good for looks. It's a solid glass piece inside with a curve to it to give some projector type of illumination.  I retro fitted this housing to my stock housing (cutting tack welding) and outfitted a HID H7 bulb with the reflector installed for single application high and low beam.  Looks good still and shines nicely.  Without the reflector and trying to use just the projector beam it basically blinds everyone and can't be adjusted much.I like the LED surround.  Wired to my low beam for night use and provides a glow not blinding but denotes more then just a single beam. During high beam application the LED shuts off. LED is two separate hot and ground wires per side and you can wire them as needed.

6/16/15 BOUGHT THIS 3057 BULB FOR MY 05 DODGE RAM SLT 5.7 HEMI .USING THEM AS REVERSE LIGHT AND IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM  HELLA BRIGHT LOOKS GOOD TOO. FITS WELL IN THE TAIL LIGHT I THOUGHT IT WOULD TOUCH THE PLASTIC BUT STILL HAS A HALF INCH BEFORE IT TOUCHES. AN I HAVEN'T NOTICED A ISSUE WITH "CK" OR "STANDARD" SOCKET THEY WORK JUST FINE. TIME WILL TELL I'LL PUT A UPDATE IF ANYTHING CHANGES AS FAR AS STOP WORKING OR FLICKERING. BUT ANYONE THINKING OF GETTING SOME OF THESE YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED THEY ARE AS BRIGHT AS PICS.9/27/172 years later still going strong no issues very satisfied

Super bright white LED's with only a very slight blueish hue.  I have tried several 194 / 168 LED replacement bulbs in the past and none were as bright as these!  These LED's were installed as replacements for the rear license plate light bulbs.  The overall LED "bulb" size is exactly the same as my factory 194 bulbs so there were no fitment issues - as was the case with other LED bulbs that were either longer and/or wider than the regular bulb.Each of these LED bulbs incorporates six 5730 high-powered surface mounted device (SMD) LED's.  Four are mounted in a circular pattern around the bulb and two are mounted at the tip of the bulb.  The 5730 LED is generally considered superior to the 5050 LED in producing more light output at the same voltage and current.Some other reviews estimate the color of these LED's to be 6500 degrees Kelvin ("K").  After comparing them to other lights with a known color, I would estimate the color of these LED's to be closer to about 5500K.  As a reference, most halogen (non-HID) headlight bulbs emit a 3400K to 3600K color.  After-market HID headlight kits rated at 6000K produce a very noticeable blue hue.Pros:- Super bright white light with only a very slight blueish hue.- High output compared to factory bulbs.- Exact same size as a standard 168, 194, etc bulbs.- Appear to be well built, including a metal heatsink for cooling.Cons:- A little pricey.Overall, a super bright white and great looking LED bulb albeit a little pricey when compared to similar offerings on Amazon.  But, as is usually the case, you get what you pay for.  I have only been using them for 2 days and nights so only time will tell if they are durable.  I will try to update this review in about a month.***** Update as of June 27, 2015 (about 5 months of use) *****LED's are still very bright with no issues or problems.  I uploaded a couple of "before" and "after" pictures.  I also measured the actual light output of these LED's using a calibrated photo (light measuring) meter.Pic 1 is with the factory OEM 194 license plate light bulbs.Light output at center of license plate (12 inches from bulb) = 13 Lux peak per bulb.Pic 2 is with the JDM ASTAR LED's installed.Light output at center of license plate (12 inches from bulb) = 159 Lux peak per bulb.More more than 10 times the light output of the factory OEM bulbs...thank you JDM ASTAR!These pics have not been "photoshopped" or altered.  We used the same digital camera with the same exposure settings at the same distance for both pics.  The Lux ("lumens per square meter") ratings are actual measurements using the same photometer on both bulbs.

It is a good product. Get what you pay for. Smaller than I thought, BUT it WILL work for me. Black finish is nicely done, as are the welds. I will be making a little modification to it for my application, but not a big deal. First photo is looking down at the top for hole placement, second is the back hole placement. Photos are not the best I know, it was 0100 this morning when I took them. Hope this helps

I used the cover for a storm with hail potential but it did not actually hail when it passed over.  With that said, I can't testify to its effectiveness but I would think that parking you car in a bounce house would work.  I will post an update when i get some hail.  Regardless, it gave me a peace of mind knowing my truck was safe with a possible hail storm approaching.  I used to worry every time.Regarding the size, I have a 2007 Silverado Crew Cab short bed that measures 229 inches.  I ordered the SUV 2 which covers sizes ranging from 198" to 230".  I was concerned it would be a tight fit but it was perfect.

Bought a set for my 05 TL to replace the awful and worn Michelins on it. Had continental dws extremes on my previous car but couldn't justify 700 bux as a current law student. Dont let the price fool you. These work fantasticly. They are so much quieter and much better in the wet than the Michelins. Definitely not as good as the Cont Extremes but they're 8/10ths the performance at 4/10ths the cost. Very much exceeded my expectations.

I decided to take the time to make my own air intake for my 2013 Audi S6 since there are very few out there and the ones that are out there are overpriced. I bought some aluminum tubing along with these Upgr8 4-Ply straight 3" couplers and some Upgr8 4-ply 2.5-3" reducer couplers.It gets SUPER HOT under my engine bay. Not to mention my turbo piping gets incredibly hot. I originally used some cheap silicone couplers from my local auto parts store and they practically melted. I was lucky I didn't suck part of them into my turbos. I decided to grab these and it's been 9 months with no issues at all. They are very stiff and are high quality. I couldn't be happier.

I installed those flares on my '00 Jeep Wrangler Sahara. They fit perfectly. Although since I have never installed them before it took a while to install the rubber strip on the fenders. You have to make sure that you don't waste any as the strip they provide is barely enough for the whole set. Another thing I noticed when re-installing the side markers on the front flares, you will need to trim the inside edges of the flare so the markers could fit.Overall rating, I am more than satisfied with how my jeep looks like now. Where ever I go I turn eyes towards me.Cheers,Taher

When purchased from other website, this product will take up to 6 weeks. It is a custom fit front end cover in two pieces, one for the hood and one for the bumper. eBay sell one that is priced similarly but is just one pice for the hood! Lebra website sell the same item for over $90 plus shipping and taxes...Amazon, once more, is by far your best bet. I've got my item in 3 days! Put in, followed the three steps procedure and voila'.....looks great, does its job and I saved over $25 that will keep my 2009 Prius going for the next 2 weeks!Buy with confidence, this is the best front end cover on the net, at Amazon is even cheaper.PSThis is the latest model, for the 2009 and fit all the model up to 2004. Also it has the new re-designed aerodynamic look for the hood portion, it is not the old square looking one.Check my photo uploads fro more details.

The reason this comes with no instrucrions is because there are none. It sort of fits my truck. I have a 2000 Silverado 1500 Vortec 4.3. For some reason the throttle body is located in a different spot on this truck. A lot of trucks have it up front right behind the fan shround. This one has it centered up top. Luckily I had a piece of black rubber tube from a stock intake mod I previously did, which extended my range just enough for the pipe to connect. The relocation of my MAF Sensor is part of the previous mentioned stock mod. I fastened the 90 degree rubber part directly to my throttle body. Next comes MAF Sensor, black rubber piece, grey rubber piece and then the metal tube which the brackets don't line up with anything on. I removed the metal plate that the old air box sat on and used the factory hardware from that to install the new box plates. There was no included hardware to screw the plates together and they don't line up anyway so I guess why bother. Had to bend one plate for it to cradle the piece which holds the cone. Just wanted to give some basic instruction in case someone else encouters this situation. Also hope that the seller and buyer realize that this is not a direct fit product and if you go into this thinking its plug and play then you will have a lot of aggravation and wasted time on your hands. Decent product for the price. Not much horsepower gain, it takes about 1% load off of the engine at idle. I can hear the air sucking through this thing like crazy though. But because you pissed me off two stars.

These are pretty bright and stylish LED light's... I installed a pair on my 2017 IS200T F-Sport that do not come with foglights from the factory... Everyone always stares at my ride maybe because it is very rare to see my brand new Lexus with them or they just look awesome! I personally gave them a 4-Star due to my first pair  not lasting more than 3-Months! The seller will exchange them without a problem, but you must pay the shipping to return them first... Overall, they are the bigger 28MM Eagle eye set and are a great design with the through bolt and nut design in a nice gloss black finish... I really love them and am sure you will too!Sincerely,Rubes Gandhi

Just want to state that even though my title says beginner helmet, this is a helmet that even a more advanced rider will enjoy. The reason i list beginner is more because of the price point. With this model only costing 50 dollars it makes it a no brainer to pick one of these up. As a new rider you have a higher chance of falling so would you rather scratch your 500 dollar bell helmet or your 50 dollar triangle helmet.  The quality of this helmet makes it feel like the price should be more around 150- 200 dollar mark. really love this helmet, make sure to grab one for yourself.Pros-comfortable-very inexpensive-multiple color choices-easy to use visor and sunglasses system-awesome customer service-good ventilationcons-Does not come in any high gloss finishes-slight wind noise

We Installed this wiring harness in our 2010 Toyota fj cruiser with a 500 watt light bar. We spent a few hours total but the outcome was worth it all the way. Because we have a fj cruiser the headlights and other auxiliary lights are always hot (meaning they can be turned on we the car is off). We took it into a automotive shop and they wired it in a way the led only shows when the headlights are on. This saving our battery. (Don't worry about doing that if your cars headlights can't turn on when the cars off)How we installed;- tested out the harness before anything else-disconected the negative terminal-found a hole in the fire wall to run our harness through(you may need to drill)-Ran the switch through our panel (because it's a Toyota the switch did not fit perfectly so we dermald a tad)-we grounded the relay to a area with lots of metal contact-ran the light bar wire through the door jam by cutting a small slot-then contencted all of wires and put the negative terminal back

Considering not the price, this oil catch is great! Machined aluminum(?), very solid construction. Replace the hosing immediately - it will not withstand engine bay temperatures and is not designed to work with oil (it is water tubing). Also, be careful when using the mounting screws - the heads strip out very easily. When installing mine, I had to put the included washers on BOTH sides of the bracket because the tapped holes were not deep enough.Overall, I am very happy with this catch can.

Update I added a pic to show how well these bad boys hold up. It has been  more then a year and the contact rust you see is just that contact rust from the back of my rim, and some never seize that is stuck on from the cold up here in the north (41 today berrrrr) Any way Had them off to do some work on the the Jeep and thought I'd take the opportunity to show you how they hold up. I run these all year round in the muck and snow against the salt and mud season, Even take on the dreaded frost heaves no vibration no issues. SO go ahead and bolt em' on you will not be sorryReceived a day late but that's ok shipping was included :) they are beautiful high quality and well machined. The marriage surface is perfectly flat and sits flush, They are able to be torqued correctly. Great spacer, gives my wheels an amazing stance the 5/5 lugs match and are the right length and the aluminum is high grade such good quality for an amazing price very happy five stars all the way.Just remember they are hubcentric 71.5 bore so make sure yours matches.

I've had two of these (first one replaced under warranty) - and they're almost impossible to install as designed.Issues:1. The seam stitching makes it difficult to slide into the groove in the piece above the tailgate2. The overall dimensions are a bit small, making it almost impossible to secure the plastic tabs along the body.  The first set of tabs ripped out.3. The straps to secure the boot around the roll bars are too short - they're extremely difficult to secure4. The "pull tabs" on the rear are held on with weak stitching - one pulled off with almost no effortGood concept, but poorly executed.  Rugged ridge needs to use better stitching, redesign the method for securing it to the rail above the tailgate, and increase the strap lengths and overall dimesions.

I am the only person that used this device and it was not used in a commercial environment. I used it less than a week before it fell apart. When I pulled the protective cover off of it, the whole sensor head detached itself from the body. The piece of red tape you see in the picture is holding the battery in place as the plastic cover broke off too. I can only wonder about the accuracy of this product. I am no doubt returning it.

I actually purchased these pads 3 1/2 years ago.  I had previously never used Wagner, but thought to give them a try.  I was under the impression that they were a good brand of pads.  I don't drive my pickup heavily- some towing from time to time, and about 7,500 to 8,500 miles per year.  They have worn about 1/2 way, which isn't why I'm reviewing them.  That's just normal wear.I recently pulled the axle shafts out and wheel hubs off to replace my parking brake shoes.  When I took one side of service brake pads off, one of the pad's friction material came right off the metal part!  It just fell off before I could get the pad out of the caliper.  What kind of bonding materials is Wagner using... for Severe Duty pads?  So, I'll try a set of Raybestos now.  If it happened once, it can happen again.  Now, time to take a look at the front pads I did at the same time... think I'll order a new set of Raybestos before I take the rotors off.EDIT:I attached a photo of the pads that came apart.  You can see that the bonding agent, whatever was used, simply did not hold.  The other pad viewed from the edge was included so you can see the thickness life left in the pads.  They were just shy of where the shave on each end of the pad starts.  They had just over 27,000 miles on them.

Small yet Strong!Hard to find smaller shackle. After pressing in steel reducing bushing 1" to 7/8" to my bumper D-Ring tabs for a tow bar, it reduced the inside diameter for recovery use shackles. Ordered these to try as they indicated a 3/4" (PIN) which is what I needed. Stamped right on the shackle is 3.25 ton WLL (working load limit) which is ample for most 4000 pound Jeep Wranglers, smaller trucks and SUV's. Nice protective finish should look good for years of use. Posted photos should answer your questions, which show the dimensions for the 5/8" diameter shackle with 3/4" Pin. Regarding hole size; this is a 3/4" diameter PIN, therefore, it requires a 7/8" hole for the PIN to pass through. Yes, this is 'ONE' Shackle only price; if you need 2, order a second one.

Installing it on my 2014 Grizzly SE was not as easy as it should have been.  My Grizzly came with brush guards on the front and rear and the rear ones had to be removed to make room for the Quadboss.  Not a huge deal as I never really liked them anyway.I saw other reviews where the buyers stated they needed spacers on the bottom holes. I had that issue as well but I don't think it was from poor design but instead from ATV use.  I use my Grizzly to grade my driveway with Gravel Rascal, which really put a lot of strain on the rear pin hitch.  When I put the Quadboss in place there was a space about the thickness of 2 pennies between the bottom holes and the unit.  Once I secured the top two bolts I just tightened down the lower bolts and it did pull in tight.The only issue I had with this was that the hitch sits high.  I had an ATV class 1 trailer hitch and it cannot be used now.  I ended up taking my 3" hitch off of my truck as a temp adapter for the ATV and even that was too high.  I was pulling a 4x8 trailer and for that I will need a 4-5 inch dropdown if I want my trailer to be somewhat level.Construction appeared fairly heavy duty.  I would imagine the AVV mounting tube frame would bust before this puppy would.The instructions state this is for a 2007 thru 2015 Grizzly 550/700.  Mine was a 700SE which has a slightly different frame but it still fit.

Nice inexpensive box! Lightweight so doesn't add a ton of weight to my enclosed trailer. I drilled some holes in the bottom and attached it to some L brackets I picked up at he Hardware store along with some rubber washers. I sealed the lid best I could with some weather stripping. I still need to get it out in a good rain storm or dusty road to see how air tight it is. I plan to probably mount a solar cell to the top and store a 12v battery in the box to power the interior trailer lights. Would buy again.

Product works pretty well.  I will have to see how it will last and after the rain.  Biggest issue is the spray bottle head.  I don't know if I got a defective one or they are all like this.  The included spray head leaks badly.  More leaked out the spray head all down my hands than I could spray out the spray head on the car.  I lost more product on my hands, shoes and on the ground than I could apply.  Made a huge mess.  Will upgrade my rating to maybe a 4 if it seems to last as stated in listing.  The spray head problem is big turn off.  It is a little hard to see due to the spray is white as is the bottle.

Installed 2001 Toyota Tacoma PreRunner 4 door 3.4 liter (TRD off road) 17 inch rims 6 lug.WARNING: please read forum(s) about your RIM SIZE. I have 17 inch rims. You may be able to get away with 16 inch rims. The calipers are large and may rub on the inside of anything smaller.I was looking for aftermarket oversized brake kits....$800.00 to $1,200.00. My friend suggested Tundra brakes on my Tacoma. I looked into it on forums and found Amazon has such a kit. I bought it!I also bought the following.From AmazonQTY: 1 Part number: 950.44510 (Don't let the picture fool you. There is only ONE brake line for the rear ONLY) You only need the one.QTY: 1 Callahan Brake parts KitFrom RockAutoQTY: CENTRIC 95044014 StopTech Stainless Steel; Sold as a Pair.The only modification I had to make to the dust shield was trim the length of the dust shield with some tin-snips. About 2 inches from one end of the dust shield. After that it was plug and play. I did have to bleed the heck out of the brakes to keep the pedal from fading. I did replace the rear main rubber brake line with the stainless line. I ran DOT 4 brake fluid through all the lines. Basically bled each line until it was super clear and clean fluid was coming out.I'm pretty UPSET!!!! THAT I DIDN'T DO THIS SOONER!!!!!! IT IS THE BEST BRAKE INVESTMENT I MADE ON THIS TRUCK EVER!!!!I bought this truck new with 11 miles on it. I now have over 285,000 miles and this is the most amazing, smooth, consistent brake feel ever.I tow a utility trailer and popup camper with this truck on occasion with no issues. Brake pedal does not pulse, brake pedal is consistent and the stop is always smooth.NOTE: When done bleeding your brakes and take a test drive the pads do catch on the rotors and lock up... a little, especially when backing up.Let the pads and rotors wear...only take a few minutes to drive and apply a little pressure to the pedal as the vehicle is in motion.

The smell is breath taking, it really smells great, however the strength of the smell is much to be desired. I expected it to smell stronger, but from opening it I realized its not a liquid but more of a wax which would explain why it smells stronger when my car is hot. My  I conclusion is when the wax melts the smell is emitted.

Excellent product and top quality made in the good ol'e USA :) instead of freaking china, which is pure garbage....Do yourself a big favor a bounce on the steps PRIOR to connecting the wire harness, this will settle the mechanism properly - DO NOT GRIND THE PITCH WELD!!!!Get a couple of plastic rivets and cover extra holes from the old steps, if you had any.Use plenty of zip ties and extra wire protectors tubing, heat shrink tubing, etc to be sure that the wires are NOT bouncing around the engine bay and under the truck, you do NOT want to get the wires pinched by moving parts and short out the system as it connects to the master OBDII port. Make sure you heat shrink the wire connectors to make them 100% water proof for the LED lights. Clean the area with alcohol prior to sticking the LED lights under the body to ensure proper adhesiveness. Also, make sure you use lithium grease or equivalent and LUBRICATE the motor gears as well as mechanism gears to ensure proper operation as well as extend the life of the motors. For the control module it is best to install it away from the heat as much as possible, slightly tilter to the side to make sure the water runs off if it ever gets on it. Make sure the pig tail connector clips in correctly with both sides of the connector properly seated until you hear a click on both sides. I did not use the rubber boot to run the control wires through it, I used the brake cable grommet instead and sealed it with black silicone on the outside, you do not want to disturb any wires in the boot, trust me....1) use blue masking tape to avoid scratching the under body paint prior to removing/installing new steps2) remove the old steps3) lay out the wires on the ground - one side is shorter than the other, the shorter side is the driver side...4) install electrical wiring, taking your time, one inch at a time, properly securing the wires with zip ties along the way; slice a tiny slit in the brake cable grommet and run 2 grey wires inside the truck's cabin; DO NOT USE QUICK CONNECTORS, solder the wires instead to the OBDII pig tail provided - remember this system connects to the master network/cpu port, you do not want the connection becoming undone damaging your main computers... solder solder solder.... DO NOT CONNECT THE PIGTAIL, OR INSTALL THE FUSE until all of the components have been installed4) install 4 arms, 2 on each side - gear arms are for the front of the vehicle5) grease up the gears on the gear arms and 2 motors and install the motors - DO NOT over tighten the 3 Allen screws or use power tools to tighten, use your hand and very gently tighten in clock wise direction6) install the running boards on each side of the truck, the plastic caps on the side of the steps, do not remove the screw completely, otherwise the plastic bracket will fall in... lol good luck fishing it out...7) bounce on the running boards to settle them in closer to the arms and not the middle, failure to do so may scratch your paint under the doors as well as the running boards getting jammed under... bounce bounce bounce8) connect the 30 amp fuse on the main harness, then connect the OBDII pig tail; the board will retract as soon as they are powered; the pig tail does not power the boards, only controls the module9) check for proper operation and make sure nothing is grinding against the trucks body10) use common sense  do not attempt to open the doors without taking into consideration the clearance for deployment.11) I am pleased with the superb quality of the product and craftsmanship and I wish more products would eb made here at home, good olde US of A

Works well as long as you have a permanently mounted roof luggage carrier.  I like it because it folds up into a very small package for storage. The cargo bag carried our inflatable rafts and sleeping bags without any wind noise.  I needed a ladder to load and unload from my astro van but that was expected.  The product is waterproof because there is a flap that is velcro-secured to prevent water from leaking through the zipper.  There are 8 straps that secures the bag to the roof.  I am glad I did not buy a hard shell because a hard shell does not flex to accommodate odd sized camping gear.  I recommend this product.

Easy Install. No problems at all. Installed on my 2013 Honda Accord EX-L Navi without any issues. Look great and "feel" great. This is my 5th install over the years. I like the idea of allowing air to cool the rotors, Pads, and brake fluid by ventilation. Car handles better in wet weather. All the vehicles that I have installed these on, handle exceptionally well in the rain and on a dry day. I took this photo after the install. Sorry it is a bit dark, but I had already put my car back in the garage. For my Honda Accord, my JBR1571XPR Set consisted of JBR1571XR for the Passenger Side Rotor and JBR1571XL for the Driver Side Rotor.

Very happy with these so far. Used them to replace the outboard back-up lights in a 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee (they fit even though it says they won't). Very easy to swap out. Much brighter than the OEM incandescent bulbs.-- I used JDM ASTAR Extremely Bright 900 lumens Error Free 360-Degree Shine 921 912 906 904 902 3035 Chips LED Bulbs For Backup Reverse Lights, Xenon White (Only used for backup reverse lights) to replace the inboard (liftgate backup bulbs).

These lights are excellent, and a cheap way to add super bright driving lights to your bike for $20 instead of $200 plus like kuryakn or others want to charge. Installed on Yamaha Vstar 1300T and instantly added bright driving lights and turn signals. I did get the hyper flash after installing these, but I actually don't mind as I believe it's better visibility. I have since swapped out all bulbs on my bike to various JDM LET'S. I have nothing bad to say.

Put this on the back of my Honda Silverwing.  Color matches the bike fairly well.  Had to make a custom mount for it, but that is due to the bike, not the box.  Quality is decent, especially for the price you pay for it.  Rack seems to be fairly secure on its mount, I doubt it would survive if the bike were dropped, but probably none would.  Gives a good amount of extra storage space.  Lock mechanism is a bit funky/finicky but you figure it out.  Just don't loose the key or you will probably have to scrap the box.

I needed a jacket that was versatile, affordable, safe, and could keep me dry from light rain.  This jacket does that and more. There are the most pockets I've seen in any jacket, and I own Alpinestars, like 4 big name brands. This competes with them but wins bc of the lower price. Just check the photos for how great it is!It is breathable on the bike for warmer weather, waiting to try the liner for winter but it feels nice and warm inside the house!

Works great and lasts. bright as hell and makes my truck look super off-road on my 2001 f150 Lariat.i recommend sealing edges with some sort of sealer to weatherproof the led bar so no chance of sense getting wet/moist inside. all led bars for that matter.

This is a great idea and design that falls woefully short in build quality. Typical imported junk hardware and junk welding. Three of the sheet metal screws broke off in the pilot holes, forcing new drilling locations.  Then!  After installing the mounting bracket dead square to the edges of the tailgate?  The ladder was a good 15 to 20 degrees off and pointed off the high edge of the tailgate. Take a look at the two pics I took. One is with the mounting plate square. The second is what I had to do to get the ladder straight to the tailgate. The welds of the quick release pins are the culprit. They're wayyyyyyy out of square to the plate.Frankly the whole thing feels cheap and weak.  Would not buy again.

Covers every inch of my windshield. Keeps the inside quite a bit cooler, more than I was expecting. Comes with a pouch to keep it in when not in use as well as a sticky mat to place your phone on your dash. Would definitely recommend. I ordered the XL size.

Very heavy duty and durable motorcycle cover. This is definitely going to do the job, and is unlikely to tear.I bought two, one for my Honda 600 VLX, and one for my Harley Heritage. On a recommendation I went ahead and went one size larger for the Honda, the XL, because I have a full size windshield, and highway bars on it. I think it was the right choice. I was concerned that if I purchased a larger size that it might balloon in high winds and possibly know the bike over. The cover comes with attached "belly straps" that connect under the bike to prevent that from happening. Good to know. I have attached a picture of the Honda with the cover on. The windshield isn't attached, but it looks like there will be plenty of room once it is.The product is a bit more expensive, around $90, but I think I'll get much more use out of it. I don't like have to buy covers for my motorcycle or BBQ over and over. Better get something good the first time. This definitely fits the bill.

The product itself is great. Installation was very straight forward. It took me 2 hours to complete. I did add zone front sway bar links, although not necessary ( mine had a broken one anyway.) . I would only recommend ordering shock boots to protect the shafts from debris. I personally think they should have been included In the kit since the shocks are not shielded like the oem style. The stance and ride are exactly what I wanted and anticipated. I'm sure they will settle a little bit, but initially the rear went up 2.75 inches and the front 3.25"( measured from floor to fender before and after) or may be that the oem springs had 210k miles on them and sagged a bit. No driveline vibrations or issues of any kind.

I buy one medium sized bottle to fill up a bunch of smaller bottles. This stuff works great, depending on my driving habits I average and additional one to three miles per gallon. Since I only have a 9 gallon tank I use half of the small bottle when I fill up which is a little less than three ounces.

These hooks are just what I needed in my 05 F250. I've found some loads were just too short to strap with the factory tie down locations. Which leads me to my next point, I see a lot of people installing these up high in the bed. I guess if it fits an individual's needs to have them mounted higher go for it. But personally I think mounting them low is better.Several months ago I needed to strap metal roof panels down. The factory tie downs were too high to put force on the load. I had to ask Lowe's for blocks to put under my straps. That's when I decided to look for a solution and found these awesome D hooks. The next time I hauled the roof panel it was so much better! No blocks, just strap and go!Installation: **Hardware is NOT included with these.**  I used 1" bolts, 1 washers on the top side, and 2" washers with a locking nut on the bottom side. I already had the painted nuts and washers that I used, but stainless steel would be a better option.After drilling my holes, I shot some black spray paint from each side, then I put RTV sealant under the D mounts, and between the washers and the D mount. Each D Mount is positioned just after the bed curves up and between the humps. (See photos) the position they are mounted, makes them almost completely flush inside the bed, and is out of reach for standard width plywood. Speaking of plywood that's another example of something you might need to strap from a lower mount point.Pros:  *These mounts are very solid.  *D hook flips down nearly flush  *One mounting hole is easier to install and looks cleaner.  *Easy to use and connect a variety of straps/ropes etc.  *Small raised bumps under the mount grips the bed and keeps it from turning.Cons:  *None. These do everything I need them too at a great price.Final thoughts: I looked at several other options before deciding on these. The other mounts had two mounting holes which I thought was not only ugly, but added complexity in drilling holes. With a single hole you don't have to worry if it's slightly off. Make sure you paint and seal your drilled holes, the last thing you want is your bed rusting at the point where loads mount!

This stuff is magic. It removes just about everything but deep rust pits. Yes it's a surface rust mover along with a great polish but don't think it's going to take deep rust out. I saw a review where a guy gave this product one star because it didn't remove the amount of rust he had. Again it removed oxidation and SURFACE rust. Not deep pits. We have a lot of cars and trust me this shines the chrome perfectly! I even used this on 67 year old NOS parts and made them look brand new again.

Fit a 2007 Trailblazer.  The gray was a little lighter than the truck plastic, and the big switch was very loose in the new part, had to shim it up and back.  This photo is also upside down.  But all in all it works.  Just took longer to install because of the switch shims.Update:  November 16, 2015.  Went out to kiss girlfriend good bye and discovered that part had broken.  Tab on top/rear had sheared cleanly off.

Improves both sound and low-end power on Evo X. Bought this because Im not quite ready to start tuning the car yet and Im very happy with it, as usual with K&N products. As others have said, the blow-off valve is considerably more audible once this filter is installed, which in itself makes it 100% worth buying IMO.Havent noticed any improvement in gas mileage yet (which is why I purchased it to begin with), but the fact that it never needs to be replaced outweighs that. Im sure if I was... easier on the gas pedal I might see the fuel efficiency improve, but that BOV is too nice a sound not to want to hear it.

This is a review of the NOCO Genius Boost Plus GB40 Jump Starter by Noco.I purchased this a little too late. The other week my wifes suv battery was dead and we had to jump the suv using the old fashioned vehicle to vehicle method which is a pain. Our suv has gone through batteries like candy and is constantly having battery issue. This bothers me as I am afraid one of these times the battery will die in a place there is no one to help my wife jump the suv to get it running and get it back to the shop or to allow her to get home safe. Plus we have a child which makes this worse.This is a wonderful solution. I looked high and low for a  solution and just found this one. Yes, they have jump packs that are huge and will do the trick, but my dad home one and it would drain on its own and be dead within the month which means it needed a constant charging to keep it reliable.I really like this one and choose this one for the following reasons.1.) It is light weight, small and lithium.2.) It has a built in 100 lumen flashlight which makes night jumps a whole lot easier to do. Especially as my hood does not have a light built in.3.) The cables are very flexible and are a heavy duty 8 gauge.4.) This can be used as a power bank as well but that does not interest me. (So say you are broken down and have a dead battery, use the usb port to get that phone working to call for help.)5.) Came with a DC 2.1amp charger adapter. Note  You can use the dc adapter to charge this or simply use the included micro usb cable to charge this using a usb wall power adapter or usb hub. Use a power source of at least 2amps.6.) Came with a cloth bag you can put everything  in to keep it together.  (Perfect size for your glove or trunk.)7.) Is rated up to 1000amps which is rated up to 20 jumps on a single charge. I personally plan to charge this after every time I need to jump as it is not frequent to be safe.8.) The charge unlike the larger portable units takes far longer to drain since it is lithium. It can kee a charge up to a year. Again, I would not push the maximum time frame and I plan to charge this every 3 months as precaution. Super easy to do and it will avoid murphys law from popping up.9.) It is 7,035 joules which is how much power it pumps out in 3 seconds. This one is rated for engines up to 6l  gasoline or 3l for diesel. Again, I always rather go bigger. So if you are on the upper size engine, I would recommend the 2000 amp model to give you more then enough oomph.Best feature of this is the safety it offers. Jumping between two vehicles can be very dangerous  and is not something I  prefer my wife doing. These are not only spark proof but have reverse polarity just in case.Summary  While I hope we actually never need to use it I feel this is the best type and model of a battery booster available for me at this time and would recommend to friends and family.

I have nothing but great things to say about this bumper.  I was wondering at first if the bumper from this company was quality since I'd never heard the name.  I have one thing to say.  I love this bumper.  I took off my Smittybilt SRC and when installing this bumper every hole for the mounting bolts was perfect on my 14 JKURubicon.  Nothing like the hammering and pain it was to install the Smittybilt.  Winch holes and driving light holes lined up perfectly.  They also include the bolts and nuts for the lights.  You won't regret buying this.  I'll post pictures soon.  Great job E-autogrills!  I can't wait to get your rear bumper and fender flares!

Cannot beat this intake for the money.  I've had AEM, Airraid, K&N on different vehicles and while the finish might be better on the aforementioned brands, honestly if it's not a show vehicle I don't really care considering this cost me at least $150 bucks less.  Installed on my 2004 GMC Sierra Z-71 in about 45 minutes - from hood up to hood down.  The bend does come close to the fan shroud, but nothing actually hits on mine.Noted a bit better performance in terms of throttle response, and the sound at 2200-2700 rpms is awesome.  Not sure about fuel economy difference at this point because I'm smashing the gas a ton!

Now I have to rip my projectors back apart.... 2 days later and they all are flickering non stop & are very dim.  these are complete garbage. I'd spend the extra money and get them from the retrofit source so your not wasting your time...

I had to do some digging around but after speaking with a rep they pointed me in the direction of these shocks. They went on my 98 4x4 Durango with no problem, even with the shackle lift in the rear. The back end does sit just a little higher than the front but levels out perfectly with my trailer attached and loaded up. Just finished taking the trailer on the interstate and had no stability problems, any time the trailer tried to fishtale the shocks would soak it up immediately. Very pleased.

The lights were easy to install in the fog light housing. They are super bright. But it does not light many feet in front of truck. But I bought just for the look it gives my truck. Great buy. Will buy from jdm again.

Only had good yorkim experiences until these. Total garbage. They don't fit in either 3057 or 4157 as they claim they should and when they do they don't come back out AND/OR they don't turn on. Sending them back.

Great quality huge space clips on very securely but if i bought it again id buy a color other than black so it can stand out more. 1 YEAR UPDATE: i have used the heck outve this thing, as you can see in photo. Everytime ive washed it its still kept its dark blacl color and still no rips or signs of it starting too. Its still very strong and i load it full of glass often since we normally ahoot glass bottles on our trips and take home all the pieces to dump in the trash.

I can fairly easily lift the rear of both bikes by myself, another reviewer said it takes two people.  I guess with a really heavy bike you might want somebody to spot you, but with my bikes it's not a problem - just be a little careful.Changing the stand from "standard mode" to "spooled mode" or vice-versa is very fast, less than 60 seconds to flip both sides over and re-tighten the bolt using the supplied and very handy thumb wrenches - so no tools are needed.The stand is very stable with both bikes, I can sit on them while on the stand (again be careful not to lean over too far, but it is stable).  This is my second Pit Bull stand, my first one was stolen (different style).  Pit Bull makes an excellent quality stand, they say it will outlast your bike, but I think it will outlast me!  The only things that can possibly wear or break on this stand are the wheels themselves, which seem durable, and the rubber pad on the standard mode may get chewed up after years of use.  But that pad could probably be cut off and replaced with a few wraps of 100 mph tape.If your bike can take spools (there will be an open threaded hole near the rear of the swingarm, by the axle) but doesn't actually have them, you can buy them pretty cheap, and Pit Bull actually sells them too.Overall I highly recommend this stand.  Even if you only have one bike, it seems worth the extra few dollars to have one that is adaptable so you can use it on your friends bikes or any other bikes you may get in the future.

I have had my saddlebags for a few months now and I can honestly say they are holding up well. I did do a modification when installing mine by attaching a keyed locking mechanism to each bag and locking them to my bike.  A couple holes in each bag, installing brackets and all good to go. I say well made and I have no complaints on these bags.  Very fast delivery as well so what more could you ask for.

No experience with full face helmets so I can only comment on the look and quality. I have always ridden with half helmets so this was purchased for my HJC CL-17. This is identical to the OEM shield that came with the helmet in terms of weight, fit, and finish. Fits the same, open an closes the same...... exact. As far as how dark it is? It looked pretty dark when I mounted it but it is quite surprising how much visibility you have while wearing. Yes, for the absolute privacy people, you can see your eyes through the shield in the daylight. I wouldn't recommend wearing it at night but you could get away with it if there was decent street lighting. Similar to dark auto tint. It's been raining for 2 weeks since I got the shield so I have no usage to date.

These bulbs skew more to the blue side of the color spectrum and are definitely much brighter than my old stock bulbs. I really am happy with the results BUT these do NOT fit my 2006 Highlander Hybrid right out of the package. I should have returned them but one of my bulbs was out and due to inclement weather, I did not want to wait for another set to arrive. These bulbs have 2 slots for 2 grooves where my car only has 1 groove. (See photo)To make these bulbs work I used a small chisel to shave the plastic tabs away and this did the trick. I don't recommend doing this but for those whose cars have the proper groove alignment, you will be happy with these bulbs.

2 year Update:Still looks great, no color fading (unlike Hurculiner) and only 1 quarter sized spot that flaked off and it was easily fixed.Update: just ordered 4 more in 2 orders and 3 of them arrived leaking paint out of the shipping box! If you need paint now, go buy it at a box store. What a huge were of time!Update:1 year later and it still looks great.No flaking, peeling or fading.The truck i did in Hurculiner at the same time has totally faded and needs redone.I won't be using Hurculiner again.I've both rolled and sprayed this stuff.3/8 nap foam roller works perfect.Plastikote Has no fumes compared to huculiner.It Cleans up way easier then huculiner. It dries 10x faster then huculiner.its not as abrasive as huculiner.But It is way thinner then huculiner.Hurculiner is thicker and sticks to everything better.Time will tell which brand holds up better and last longer but that's why I used both brands so I'd know which is indeed better.

I bought a bottle of this Iron Free to compare with the Sonax, a similar product, I have been using. I began searching for a new product as the Sonax reaks (seems really bad). This Iron Free product held its own against the Sonax. In the photo I have 1/2 the rim sprayed with Iron Free and 1/2 with Sonax. After rinsing the products off with my pressure washer there was no difference. They both do the job to melt away baked on brake dust. With both products, you have agitate the surface with a rim brush. This is not a spray on and hose off and walk away product. And finally,  the Iron Free does not smell nearly as bad as the Sonax. That is why I'm giving it a 5 star review. It does not particularly smell good but the difference is huge. It is tolerable.However, Nanoskin makes a purple rim cleaner, acid based, called speedy bright. It is literally spray on and hose off. That is what I use the majority of the time. I'm in the detailing business.

These are ok... you get what you pay for. They fit the jeep... as in the mounted up ok, they do not contour to the body but that does leave space to run the wiring under the bracket. I went through 3 sets... all 3 had scratches on them... poor packaging, and all 3 sets were the wrong bracket kit. I ordered the bracket set for a 50" LED light bar and every set that was sent was turned to be for a 52" LED light bar. It didn't matter what the part number on the box was either, as they were all the same basic mount... cheapo. But that's what you get for the price.

Used this to replace the old halogen on my '85 Suzuki ATV. Awesome! Far, far more light and a lot less power used. Also added two 15w LED headlights to Suzy and this LED bar complimented them VERY well. Great combination and a great LED Bar light. The light has a good amount of over-spray to light up both sides of the trail. The pics do not show as much light as your eyes can see because the camera can only get the brightest part of the beam. 1st pic shows the headlights, the 2nd pic adds the 36w LED bar light. From the ATV to the woodpile is about 40ft, to the house is around 150ft. Very happy with these lights. Not the first one I've bought!

Well packed. Really nice quality plate frame. Took no time at all to swap out the ugly dealer frame for this carbon fiber one. Looks 100% better. Now it looks like a car enthusiasts car. Ha-ha. Used the "cruiser accessories 82650" black fastener caps to cover the screw heads and finish off the look. The caps also are large enough to mount the cover firmly as well as cover the gaps from the larger holes in the cover. I finished it off with some double sided tape that I slipped between the cover and the plate to be sure it didn't rattle.And a Brembo sticker for personalization!

So I was looking to cool down my oil temps and this fit the bill for form and function.  Install was pretty uneventful except when it came to start up the car (1999 Integra GSR), oil spewed EVERYWHERE !The "gotcha" was that what you cannot see in the product picture is that the other side of sandwich plate has two squared off corners and as a result, the oil filter size for my car doesn't have an o-ring big enough to cover those squared off corners.  So when I started the car, oil went everywhere.I measured what circumference was required to cover those corners and ended up bringing the brass threading with me to an auto parts store and pretty much went through every filter they had until I found a match, and it ended up being an oil filter from a late 80's Dodge Caravan of all things (Fram PH3950), and it works great !  (there is no reason why this exact filter shouldn't be used on *any* install of this oil cooler)My oil temps are 20-25 degrees lower than before the install, so I'm happy with this product as it's doing it's job !

I've only had the chance to use it once so far but I really really liked the results. Not all shiny glossy like they've been oiled up, just new/clean looking. Washed the truck again a couple weeks after and appears to still be protecting the tire some. I will continue to use on my tires.

Very small yet capable.  I have used this three times to remove R-22 from systems needing repair or recharge.  In each case I was able to weigh the charge back in to know precisely the amount of make-up refrigerant needed according to the manufacturer's compressor unit or single package unit label.  Charging by weight is much better than gauge pressures and easier than subcool calculations, especially when charging documentation is not present.  Has a screen inlet filter so you should consider adding a filter for protection of the internal seals, etc.  Easy to operate.  In high temperatures I utilize a small return from the recovery cylinder, see diagram, to lower the head pressure and increase the total amount of refrigerant recovered.  It also leaves less in the machine and exit hose if you can do this procedure.  Simply feed a very small amount of vapor back into the suction side to a tee or using a service port on the unit being emptied.  Watch your pressure gauges to see that the suction pressure is constant or lessening as the liquid pressure is also going down and the recovery cylinder becomes cooler.

I'm not happy with the size of this cargo bag. It is designed to fit inside the Curt basket. Curt bag inside a Curt basket. That should be very simple.  I understand they want it to fit without being too large, but there is just way too much room on the sides. My gear is designed to fit in the basket but will not fit inside this bag because it is much much smaller than the basket.This leaves me with an unusable $70 bag.Thanks Curt.

I have had these lights since June of 2014. Since then they have been mounted on my car and have been through all kinds of weather and temperatures, especially since I don't have a garage to park in. I have never had an issue with these lights. The beam on them is great. It lights very well in a wide area. These lights are as bright as they were on the day I bought them. The inside of the clear part has some condensation and the lens have turned from totally clear to a little fogged, but in the design of these lights there is nothing impeding the actual bulbs and their reflective areas. These are great lights and if I needed more for some reason I would absolutely buy it again.

This is a quality part that worked great on one of my Jeeps that has a 4 lift. However, the description is misleading as it says it fits Jeeps with 0-3-1/2. It didn't fit my non lifted Jeep. The paper that comes with the track bar shows it to fit a Jeep with 2-1/2-3-1/2 of lift.

Just plain terrible quality! I received the latch already broken in the mail (See Pics).  Even if it did arrive in once piece I would have looked at different options after receiving it. The plastic is very cheap and brittle. You can see how terrible the mold looks, it looks unfinished.I ended up purchasing the Dorman brand for a few extra dollars and it is leaps and bounds better than this latch. Amazon's customer service was excellent as always and returned it no problem.

The picture is not what the actual product looks like. The only way I was able to view the pictures I uploaded was by looking at the item itself & then scrolling down & over on the right hand side near the top by the first review. If you click on "customer reviews", the pictures are not available.The "gold" color you see is actually black heavy duty plastic. I have added additional pictures of the actual item & this review is based on those pictures & what I encountered. The lock seems to be very well made & durable. I only gave it a 4-star because of the issues below.Tailgates can be pricy in order to get the exact one to fit, adjustments that need to be made & painted to match the rest of the truck. If you are not sure if this is for you, contact your insurance agent to see if theft of the tailgate is covered under your comprehensive coverage. At this point, you'll only pay for the deductible to get it replaced. If your tailgate is stolen for a second time, they may not cover it. This is an inexpensive alternative. Besides, if a thief really, really wants it, they will try everything to take it.I have a 2008 GMC 2500. Looking at the pictures, the fit is good but it does wobble a little bit. I had to add something between the truck & the tailgate to fill the gap, otherwise the lock slipped to the right & gave narrower protection & wobbled more. It just so happened that I had a large nut on hand...should you discover this with yours & want to do as I did, I'd suggest looking in the plumbing section at a hardware store. Be sure it is not thicker that the space that is open, otherwise you may run into an issue of getting the tailgate back on.Once the lock was installed, when the tailgate was closed, it was a snug fit, the exact distance of the gap from the tailgate to the bed of the truck. There still is some play in it & I wiggled it around & pressed on the black tab & I was able to get it a little tigher. It does come with vlecro but I see to issues with this, 1 Eventually the weather elements will cause the adheasiveness to giveway. 2 The lock is a pain to remove & the velcro will make it that much harder. To remove the lock, the key only turns so far easily. What they don't tell you is there is a spring action past the easy turn of the key. The key has to go past the spring all the way & you have to keep the key turned & pull on the black tab for it to release, this will decrease frustration & the risk of breaking off the teeth.The rubber tab that covers the key is useless. When the tailgate is closed, I can see it giving some protection by way of gravity. When the tailgate is open, the rubber cover falls open. If you haul dirt, it can get into the key chamber easily, I used a piece of electrical tape to hold it closed.One of the picture shows the exposure with the tailgate down, I can see that it can be possibly broken & removed but it looks as though a hard blow with a hammer & screw driver or a pry bar but how likly is a thief going to go to that measure? Someone mentioned that it may be possible for someone to jerk on it hard enough to break it, in my opinion, if you are Hercules & can pull up or pry up while holding the tailgate at an angle, I still it is better than nothing.

I bought these for the 2006 MINI Cooper S we've had for ten years.  The lift supports will not stay up now that the weather is cooling off.  These seemed like a bargain, and the reviews were good. I have no idea how anyone has gotten these to work on a MINI. They were a little too long for starters, but I installed one of them anyway.  After installing one, I could not get the hatch to go down. I pushed down, and it felt like the hinges were going to snap. These are not only a little long, they have way too much pressure to work with a small car. I literally felt like I was going to break the hatch off....with only one installed.  After dealing with this, I looked up this brand on Amazon to read reviews from other cars, and other people have had similar issues with this brand. (Look it up.) These can cause serious damage to your car. Run away now!  I'm returning mine and buying OEM.

The bars themselves look wonderful considering the price.  However, they absolutely don't fit my 15 Ram 1500 Big Horn with towing package.  The first photo shows the area behind the front driver's side wheel well where the hardware is supposed to be installed.  You can see an oval hole with a black steel brace above it and two captive nuts below it.  The next photo shows that the steel brace interferes with the mounting bracket.  The third photo shows the supplied hardware.  Another reviewer (I believe it was Bob from Long Island) mentioned that the mounting hardware was incompatible with the 2015.  If I didn't have that brace I would simply use the supplied 12mm mounting stud and one of the two factory 8mm nuts.  However, that brace interferes with the drivers side front bracket.  The bracket has a wiring harness and large electronic device with a heat sink on the side of it.  It's proximity to the firewall makes me believe it's either part of the brake controller/wiring or electronic throttle.  It is a very strange location for electronics.  I could attempt to move it but don't want to be accused of breaking something by one of the crack dealership mechanics.  If I can discover what the device is I will update my review.  I assume only some trucks have it due to the other reviewers with no problems.  In the meantime I will spend the $600 for the factory wheel to wheel steps, available only in polished with the crew cab 6'4 bed.  As a side note, the steps themselves are rather nice looking even if the mounting brackets look awful (the brackets always look terrible)

I put these on my 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee and I could immediately see a difference.  These lights are BRIGHT!  I only had an issue when installing them where I had to epoxy the headlights into the housing because I couldn't fit the plastic ring that screws them into the housing around the lights themselves.  I wish I could give this 4 and a half stars instead of just 4 but these lights are amazing and I recommend that you buy them.

If it doesn"t light up Rotate it AND DO IT WITH URGENCY! I bought these to replace the cargo lights outside a chevy pickup for more light.. There was corrosion on the OEM contacts after 10yrs. So i had to destroy a perfectly good bulb and remove it in pieces. Next step...install the LED...No light...hmm what's that smell?? Oh!..its the new bulb! Oh Crap..its stuck in the connector and won't come out!!No one bothered to mention that IF you install these backwards that they WILL melt in a matter of seconds and can probably burst into flame. Hmmm, it would have been good to know that.  Had to jump out of the slick truck bed in the rain and scurry around to the dash controls to shut it off in a hurry! Good for an adrenaline rush.  So with the 2nd of the 2 bulbs I gently touched it to the connector to verify proper polarity BEFORE fully plugging it into the socket.Once installed correctly I had to modify the wires to make a good connection. But its working now and it IS BRIGHT!So i have one white bright LED cargo light and one dim yellowish OEM cargo light.  I would highly recommend replacing your bulbs one at a a time and verify the proper polarity on each one. Just doing a blanket install on multiples amd then turning on the switch and expecting to replace the ones that are in backwards could create a serious hazard.

For the price, this is great! My armrest in my b6 has been broken since 2006 and I refused to pay what OEM cost. It took a long time for aftermarket to catch up and by then I just didn't care anymore and dealt with no arm rest lid. I finally decided to have a whirl at a replacement.Fit is 7/10 only because the bracket insert points are too short. When you install this, the plastic hinge is bent inwards like a "V", and the nubs that go into the holes in the arm rest to attach this are too short for a really snug fit. This causes the armrest to move side to side a little. For instance when I close the cover, it will not line up correctly on its own. I simply have to move it over and snap it in to lock it. And to lock it down, you have to push harder as the latch is shorter than OEM.The finish is 8/10 compared to my factory black leatherette (Yes, I have real leather Recaro's in the photos, but my car did not come with those stock).The padding is on par with OEM and I'd say even better. I actually took the pad and leatherette top cover off of my OEM one and compared, it's hardly noticeable. This one has a tighter grain and deeper black but in a dark interior that is well over a decade old and worn as is, who cares. I'm just happy to have a replacement for a good price.Thank you for offering this at a decent price. Much appreciated.

I really wanted to like these mats, and I do like the material and the fit and finish of the mats.  There is just one large problem with them! They changed the design of the drivers side mat and removed the raised "lip" in front of the gas pedal!!!!  That is the reason I bought them as I felt it was superior design to the other weather mats out there.  That raised section in front of the gas pedal would prevent any water or slush from draining down into the base of the gas pedal.  The current design which I received has absolutely nothing there to prevent water from going down into that area.  They really need to update their pictures to accurately show the product.  These mats are getting returned.  I gave two stars because other than that I really liked how they fit, nice an flush, and covered the dead pedal area.  The passenger and rears also fit very nicely.

I have added two pictures to show that these chains can easily get jumbled up, and take too much time in un-looping them. If you don't identify such loops before making use of them, the chains can become impossible to put on.Initially when I bought these chains, I was hoping for a quick fix to problems of driving in snow. And truly, when these chains are up onto the tire, they work fine and protect you in heavy snow. Driving with these chains causes lots of vibrations only above 25 mph, that I wasn't able to properly enjoy the music in my car, however, slipping was not an issue and I was easily able to drive on nearly 4 inches of dry snow and even plenty of slush with my sedan moving even at 30 mph.But as many other 2 star reviewers have pointed out, they are a real trouble to put onto the tire, even after you have un-jumbled all the loops, if you have low clearance above the tire, like my Honda Civic has. Also, recently I got help from a road maintenance engineer who helped me put these chains and I learnt that it would be easier to put these chains on the front of the tire near the ground rather than on the top of the tire, since it's easier to see near the ground than at the top of the tire (if your tires have less clearance). But, there is a little extra risk in that, since it is still not too easy to conjoin the two ends together and if you accidentally drop one end on the back of the tire and if it got stuck on power steering, or something, you would end up having to remove the tire to get that stuff out.However, once the two ends of the chain have been hooked, and you haven't lost them on the back of the tire, it is easy to tie the other knots. Also, taking them off is not easy either, because the initial step of unhooking the two ends of the chain is the most difficult. I might have better luck by buying chains one size bigger than what was specified for my car as per Thule's manual (if you want further reason why, I can explain from certain videos i have seen).

Exactly what I was looking for! This thing is solid unlike some of the hollow cheaper ones. Weighing in at over 6 1/2 pounds this thing is ready for some serious work. Perfect fit in my 2016 Toyota Tacoma Offroad. There is just the right amount of play where it goes in and out without a fuss but fills up the receiver enough where it won't be wobbling about. Also since there is not that much extra space you don't have to worry about bending your hitch pin. A perfect match for the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Smittybilt-13047B-3-4-34-Black-D-Ring/dp/B001CF1A6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Smittybilt 13047B 3/4" Black D-Ring</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CURT-21578-5-8-In-Hitch-Pin-and-Clip-Black-Zinc-Bulk/dp/B001GN1GLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CURT 21578 5/8 In Hitch Pin and Clip Black Zinc Bulk</a>&nbsp;I bought to complete the set. Great look, great quality, and all at a great price. The box was a little abused when I received it but no doubt from this heavy chunk of metal sliding around during shipping.... you don't have to worry about this thing being "damaged" during shipping just whatever it is running into. Overall very pleased and would purchase again. Looking forward to my next recovery and will update in the future. Let me know if this helped

I bought this to replace the Upstream Right O2 sensor on my 2001 Nissan Maxima. The connector that is included is a black square "2x2" pin arrangement. The connector I needed is a 3 pin.The tip of the sensor was also shorter than the correct one.I was able to make it work by splicing the original connector to this O2 sensor.The correct part looks like the one in the picture I have attached.

This brush is better quality than I expected. It is also larger than I expected.  I included an image next to a penny so you can get an idea.  The handle is thick so it doesn't bend easily.  Works great.  I am satisfied.

I purchased a Dainese Racing D1 jacket a size up from normal and am really glad I did because this spine protector is a little on the thick but supportive side. The G2 pad is pretty big, it barely fits in the back pocket of my size 56 jacket. Having this in the designated back pocket of my jacket makes it look like I have a speed hump/air vent in my jacket... so buyers beware if you're jacket is a perfect fit, you will need more room to accommodate this spine protector. I haven't tested it out on the road yet as I'm waiting on my chest protectors to arrive but I know I'll be riding worry-free knowing I have quality dianese protection on.

DO NOT BUY. Holes aren't punched properly, you have to ream them in order to get screws to fit properly and they don't even line up that well after that. Mine just ripped while trying to get this to fit right. Of course there's only one way to seat the gasket on the pan and I had it properly but you could clearly see that their punch wasn't sharp enough to cut the gasket properly in order for the oil pan bolts to go through. They still don't even line up right. I tried using 10 or so clamps to 'form' the gasket the best I could and then in the process of clearing the rubber to fit the screws it just ripped. I'm hoping my Permatex Ultrabond will help to seal the inside ring where it ripped but if not I'll be doing the gasket again next weekend. Look into another option, if not, go with OEM, Fel-Pro is no longer a name I would trust or recommend.

This stuff is amazing! Have not done much wax personally but this stuff is easy to apply and leaves your car looking stunning. I was late to class today, did I care? NO my car looks so good I didn't care. Driving around lots of looks at how nice she shines and how clean she looks and feels.

This microfiber drying towel works great. It really sucks up the water. With a shamee you have to get it wet first. That's the good leather ones or man made material ones. I tried this towel dry right off the bat and it dried as fast as I was wiping. It can absorb a lot of water before it gets saturated. I haven't tried it on my truck yet so I brought it to work and used it on the Zamboni. I didn't wash the top of it, just the sides and the towel dried it all up without even having to wring it out. I was amazed! It even did the chrome wheels. The towel is very soft and durable. I believe it will hold up longer than most shammees. To top it off you can throw it in the washing machine to clean it. I'm just amazed at how far they have come with microfiber. From cleaning electronic screens to bed sheets, and much, much, more. I have microfiber bed sheets and they have been washed several times and still are soft and the color looks like new. That's why I believe this towel will last a long time as long as a person is careful not to let it catch on a screw or something that might rip it. I'm not even convinced that would hurt it all that much. This is a great towel!  I have no problem recommending this towel to anyone thinking of buying one or a shamee. I did purchase this product at a reduced price in return for a honest and unbiased review. I hope this review helps you out.

I installed these as "driving lights" on my 2015 Sorento. They are HIGHLY visible and really draw attention, which is what I was looking for (safety, not vanity!) I bought both "spot" and one "flood" to see which worked better for my application, either would be fine. I've had them on for several months now and they're working great.

This ultimately didn't fit my truck, even though Amazon (and even Rock Auto) said it should.  At the same time, it feels like such a quality item that I'm slightly bummed about how much more substantial it feels than the correct one!  I'm giving four stars as it's mostly not the product's fault it's advertised as fitting my vehicle.By the way - the correct part turned out to be Motorcraft # FC-935, a screw-thread-type locking gas cap.  The FC-1004 is by comparison meant for a 1/8th-turn type filler arrangement.See attached picture for a comparison of the business end of the FC-1004 (black, on the left) versus my stock, non-locking cap (white, on the right).  I've also included a picture of the place where the cap goes, for my truck.  This is the type of arrangement that the FC-1004 sadly did not fit.  I hope this helps you find the right cap!

I looked for a long time before deciding on getting this Vivid brand vinyl and strongly considered wrapping these pieces with real carbon fiber but I decided it was more work than I was willing to do but I didn't want a vinyl that looked cheap so I went with this because it had a gloss finish which is more like real carbon fiber than any other vinyl I saw during my research. I have to say I was underwhelmed when I opened the package but after a couple of days I decided to just stick it on my steering wheel spokes (where I planned to install it in the first place) very quickly and see what it looked like on a part and not just on the roll and I though that would give me a better idea as to how this vinyl was going to look and I was pleasantly surprised once I had it installed, it looked really good and a very good likeness to the real thing and it definitely looked better than the factory paint that was starting to show some wear.As I said I was not impressed when I first opened the package and could see what another reviewer meant when they said "it looks like just black" because I thought the same thing and I thought it would not show up as "carbon fiber" but just black but one I got it installed I think it looks as good as it possibly can being that this is a vinyl and the cost is next to nothing compared to real carbon fiber parts . I also saw a reviewer that said it was very thick and difficult to install but I have never done this before and I just used a heat gun (a hair dryer will work too) and it laid down easy enough. I did disassemble the 2 spoke covers to make it easier for me to get good clean edges so keep that in mind if your think about trying your hand at installing this vinyl.  I will see how this holds up after a month or two and if there is an issue I will update my review but as it stands now I am very pleased and I will say that what I received is exactly what is pictured although I could see how someone might think differently when they first open the roll but my advice would be to install it on the part you want to cover and then decide if you like this vinyl or not.  I was a little confused after reading the reviews before I bought this stuff because there are a full range of buyers from thrilled with it to completely unhappy with it so I will say I am a very picky person and am not easily pleased so bear that in mind too.

I bought this about 2.5 years ago on clearance that was in a car care kit.  It has sat in the basement for 2.5 years and I finally got around to using it yesterday. I was pleasantly surprised by the results. There's a great foam action as soon as you mix it with water, and is smells good! The two details/facts that were listed are definitely 100% true:Helps water beading on your paintDelivers mirror-like shine as you washAs soon as I rinses the car off, I could see all of the water beads just quickly roll right off the car, especially the bumper! I even included a small video because I was amazed how well it still worked after sitting still for so long!  I would definitely buy this again, and it's totally worth the money!

Deducted a star as the picture shows the wires incased in a plastic sheath, however when received there was no sheathing covering the wires, I just like the added protection. That being said this is a great wiring harness for your LED lights, if you tried to build it yourself and bought everything separate it would cost you 5 or 6 times the cost of just buying this pre made harness. It worked great on my Jeep Wrangler with plenty of wire to reach where I needed to go, the quality is nice and you can change the switch to a heavy duty rocker style if you want. I would buy it again as it is a professional made wiring harness for led lights and makes for a quick and simple install.

Being an amazon member, this arrived within 2 days. I was looking for a jumper cable in local stores that had products starting from $20. However, the gauge is an important factor. The gauge of the cable decides the current carrying capacity. Lower the gahigher uge, higer would be the diameter and higher would be the current carrying capacity.Although I have not actually jump started any vehicle using this product(both of my cars and their batteries are in good shape so far), the look and the feel of it makes me comfortable enough that they would do their job. I must say that I have used my own vehicle in the past to jump start my friend's vehicles - so I have experience in that (although that's not my professional job :D)What I liked about the product:1. The length of the cable: 20 feet. This is more than sufficient. Just imagine you car parked in the garage and requires jump start. The car is immovable and there is a wall in front and there are cars parked on the side of your car. You can easily bring a good car behind your dead car (battery) and use this cable without any issues.2. Zippered Carrying Case: Believe me, it is very handy. Especially when you don't have a big trunk. The cable perfectly fits in the case. Plus, transportation through the case is very easy.3. Instructions: We don't jump start the vehicles every now and then, so how to use the cables may slip off our mind. The instructions are written on the case as well as on a tag that is attached to the wire itself! They are very handy!What I did not like:Nothing so far. Looks perfect.3.I received this product for free or at a discounted price to evaluate and provide my honest and unbiased review. It is not obligatory on me to provide a 5 star review. The words stated here are my own observations and feelings about the product. I leave the feedback a product deserves based on my opinion.Finally, If you have learned anything helpful about this product from my review, you can let me know by clicking the yes button.

I ordered this lower panel for my 1999 Dodge Ram bumper.We have completely rebuilt our totaled truck and we were using the old bumper off the donor truck until I found the plastic replacement parts here on Amazon.This is the lower grey plastic piece that is mounted to the front bumper.The plastic material is pre molded and very high quality. The plastic needed to be heated up a little with the heat gun to get it to mount properly.All in all an excellent replacement piece!Price point is excellent compared to my local auto part stores.This is just the lower bumper piece. It does have the clips pre molded into the plastic. If you are removing the old piece and then installing this new piece, you should have everything you need to install this properly.High quality materials and workmanship.Again, we used this on our 1999 Dodge Ram quad cab 2500 4x4.I purchased this item full price.I rely on product reviews just like others to help make my purchase decisions so I try each product very carefully before reviewing and always do my best to leave honest opinions  and provide as much facts as possible based solely on my experience.

I got this headlight for a 2014 Fatboy. Contrary to what the seller said about the light I did not need an adapter ring in order to install it. Upon taking the cover off the headlight mount and undoing the actual housing the light fit in perfectly into stock housing. Additionally even though it does come with two wiring converter cables you do not need those or any additional wiring harnesses for the install on a 2014 Fatboy. The light is really bright even on low beam setting which is great. I also find the two side LED's in the light to be a nice add on. Those stay on no matter which beam setting you pick. Would recommend this to anyone looking to replace stock headlight.

Just what I wanted! I own a 2017 Mustang GT Premium. I have always loved the running horse. Been a Mustang fan since inception in the early 60's. Posted a couple of pics. The black background one is my screen save on my PC. The second one is where I decided to stick it. The running horse here is about 2/3 the size of the one in my grille. I stuck it on the passenger side dash. Looks great. Not sure If I'd use it on the outside. Just made of plastic. But in the interior is a great place. May be getting me another one soon. Just need to decide where to stick it!

I purchased these puddle lights for my 2013 Ford Explorer after making sure they would fit... They came today in the mail securely placed into a box... The lights itself were contained in a sealed plastic bag... I opening the bag to inspect the puddle lights and was very impressed with the overall quality... They were a decent weight and were not made from any cheap plastics... The lens were secured to the housing with high quality and the projector was protector by a scratch resistant sticker...The next step was to install the puddle lights... I decided to do the passenger side first and removed the old light which was just a matter of pressing in the clip and pulling them out... Then you have to disconnect the wiring which was a bit tricky but I used a flat head to help pry the female connectors off of the males... After removing the factory lights I connected the new puddle lights... After connecting the lights I checked to see if the polarity was correct In which they were so I finished off securing them with electrical tape and pushed the excess wire into the headlight housing and placed the puddle light into the headlight housing which snapped securely into place... I then checked the light to make sure it continued to work and it did... Did the same exact thing to the driver side, checked the polarity, used electrical tape, and it to snapped securely into the housing...After checking the lights I noticed the drivers side seemed to be a little off and appeared crooked... The passenger side seemed perfectly parallel... I had to wait until it was dark to really get a better look at the quality... At night I activated the lights and my OCD suspicions were spot on... The driver side was a bit more crooked then I'd like but the passenger side was perfectly parallel... I also noticed that the LEDs were a lot brighter than the factory halogen puddle lights...Overall I am very impressed with this product and highly recommend it if you are considering purchasing it for your ford... I have contacted Amazon and may have to contact the seller about the crooked logo and see how they resolve the issue so I will have to update this review then... I have posted pictures to show everyone what I am talking about but you also get to see the quality of these lights which are actually very good...My only three recommendations that i would fix on this product would be: 1. Make sure all units are checked for defects which include direction of the logos, 2. Make the LED light either brighter or add more LEDs to make them brighter, and 3. Make the connections directly on the housing instead of using wires (this will help prevents shorts without having to use electrical tape and will also prevent having to place excess wire into the housing)...My final opinion is that these lights are a great upgrade to any ford vehicle and highly recommend them to anyone thinking of purchasing them... If with the three negatives and small defect (which you can see in the picture) this lights are still high quality and bright... I'm sure they will last a very long time and am very impressed and how snug fit they are in the headlight housing....

SUPER easy install and they look awesome! Very high quality and don't let the directions scare ya. Simple and for me, no adjustments needed to latch securely to Jeep once installed. Pop off in 1 sec for doors off and slide in to keep the mud out! (Some anyway) We will see how easily they clean!

This is an excellent Light Bar.  I had my doubts about it until it was installed but after the install, it proved very nice.  I can't speak to its longevity, which ultimately is what we're all looking for, but the installation was very easy and didn't take much time on my 2015 Polaris RZR XP1000 (1K).  I did use brackets made by OSP Racing rather than the brackets that came with the light bar.  These brackets made things easier installation-wise and I was able to adjust the light bar, ever so slightly, to get it to look just right.  THERE ARE ZERO INSTRUCTIONS that come with the unit (at least mine didn't come with any), but if you know anything about 12v wiring, it was simple. Just mount the negative to the negative battery terminal, the positive to the positive and feed the switch to the inside somewhere.  I replaced the switch with one that looks more like the others in my RZR.  I will agree with other posters that the wiring leaves a LOT to be desired when it comes to believing this unit is pulling 300 Watts.  No way with how thin it is, nut if you do look at my pictures, it does a great job.  I may go back in and try to beef up the wires someday, but so far, so good.  For an installed price of under $175, it beats tons of other light bars for double or triple that amount.

I had this originally on my 2014 JK and I thought the fit was fine. However, on my 2016 JK it is buckling the top of my grille because it fits too tight on the top. I was told that I should have the nuts on the bottom, but I feel that would make the problem worse. I guess, I will use zip ties and glue some cable mounts to the inside of the grille and get rid of the brackets altogether. Otherwise, it looks great and will protect your radiator.

Super bright one in the cab lights is plenty to illuminate the entire cab. Slightly larger than halogen bulbs but still fits in fixtures. Used to replace all the lights i could and gave some to a friend who was so impressed he is going to buy more soon. Definitely buying again.

We are a bamboo charcoal loving family. When extended family came to visit, they commented that we have a really neutral smelling home. It's superb as we tend to lean fragrance-free since one of our toddlers has sensitive skin. We have 500g squares all over our current house because the prior tenants left us with smokey closets.When this BMBU brand became available for purchase at a discounted price in lieu of testing, evaluating and sharing my opinion, I totally jumped on it. We cannot have enough BMBU bags in this home, but more importantly, it's been a while since we refreshed our current cube stashes so this came just in time. I threw our other two brands outside to refresh and in the meantime, put this BMBU brand bag on the lamp next to my bed as the bedroom has built up moisture from the past week of rain. This BMBU brand did just as good as our other two brands. The first day I was too busy to take note, but by the second day our bedroom air was light and breathable and neutral again. Incidentally, our original bamboo charcoal bags got rained on a bit and it's been rainy so we haven't as of yet had a chance to dry them out or refresh them properly.Also, one day last month we randomly decided to get some potpourri-like stuff from the At Home store (formerly Garden Ridge) because they smelled really good. We threw one in our air filter chamber and the first night, the house entire house smelled like it. After three days, the smell was completely gone. It was only then that we realized the bamboo charcoal soaked it all up. What a waste of expensive potpourri, but a true testament of how great our bamboo charcoal bags have done!These are some things we do to take care of our bamboo charcoal products:-recharge them every quarter (we'd do this every month if we remember, but unfortunately we don't but we find they keep working anyway)-remember to flip and/or rotate your cubes or bags so the bamboo charcoals on every side can recharge-if you put the bamboo charcoal packs on your dash and leave your car out in the sun, it'll recharge them just as well--the bag in our van is always charging on our Saturdays running errands while our van is sitting in the parking lots. Seriously, we had a dirty poop diaper in the car from the a roadtrip which was months before. It fell under one of the captain's chairs and we had no clue because we couldn't smell it. Disgusting and true.-cloudier environments-you can recharge in the car too but just recharge them longer-if your bamboo charcoal bags get rained on like ours, just put them back out on a sunny day again and them them dry fully; they'll be good as new-the other brands we use are Moso and BambooMN. The smaller Moso bag stays in the car and the 500g cubes from BambooMN stay in the closet, shared living spaces and our kitchen.-most bamboo charcoal companies say they only work for 1-2 years but we've had some for over 2 years now and they're still working

there OK, a little thin and bit more Orange in the coloring than what I was hoping for.  Since I have a TJ with the back seat removed, I had two extra.  So I put them at the end of my Roll Cage to help get in the back area.  If I had to do it over again, I would spend a few more buck and get a thicker set.  They are inexpensive so you do get what you pay for.

Bright as daylight when this thing is on. Seriously one of the brightest I've seen especially for the price. Mounts are generic tho. I made my own from plate aluminum. Fits over the windshield of my 97 Tacoma perfectly. Just to the insides of the roof. Not even with the sides. Wanted it a little narrow so it would clear more limbs and what not. Works great and is pretty solid. No fogging problems with condensation as of yet.

I love the way it looks, but I couldn't give it 5 stars because I had to make two trips into town trying to find hardware that would work to install it.  The hardware they send is mostly useless.  It looks great once I finally found a way to mount it without drilling holes in my truck.

Looks great on my WRX. I wanted a lip that was forgiving and wouldn't crack or get damaged from curbs or anything else. Went on super easy, just make sure the ambient temperature isn't too cold and the surface is cleaned with alcohol before applying and it should stick nicely. Took 10 mins tops to install.

I looked at multiple hitches for my new 2015 CRV and most were over the $150 mark and up to $250 as some retailers.  When I saw this on Amazon for only $92 I was a bit skeptical but it looked identical to the construction of other brands I'd looked at that were nearly double this cost.  I also looked at the Curt version but didn't like the look of the main cross bar that resembled a U shape exposing more of it to view from the rear, whereas this one has a V shape that tends to conceal more of it.  I also like the loop safety chain hooks instead of the flat plate that Curt uses that will hold water and dirt and cause quicker rusting and generally less aesthetic.  Installation for this was identical according to the multiple videos for installing these on a CRV.  By the way, I did install it a bit differently than most suggest, instead of cutting the large hole in the plastic belly panel, I cut a slot out to the rear edge of the panel and was then able to mount the hitch then slide the panel in between the hitch and vehicle underbelly. This keeps the integrity of the panel in place, blocking mud and other stuff from getting where the designers didn't want it to go rather than a big exposed hole in the panel.  Quality, weight, paint, and weld on this Reese hitch were all quality and fit was perfect.

So I have been looking for a lightweight box that I can mount on the rear of our camper. I know how weak the rear bumpers are, but I removed the spare tire, and I'm only looking to store our two patio mats and plastic leveling blocks. I will purchase a BAL underslung tire mount over the winter. I'm simply tired of putting that stuff away wet in the pass-through storage compartment in the front of the trailer.So, let's go over the bad first......1) It's shipped in a single box. Mine arrived with three corners bent a little bit.2) Latch is so-so.3) Handles look to be an cheap chrome plating.4) No gasket of any kindThe good....1) Price2) Lightweight3) Price4) Lockable .... at least enough to keep the honest people out5) PriceI'm bummed that this box is not available in black. Hopefully the manufacturer does this in the future. I will probably plastidip mine after camping season is over. Mounting is very easy as long as you are willing to drill some holes. It is definitely not waterproof, however the lid does overlap the sides so it is at least water resistant. Overall, a great box for the money. It fit my needs perfectly since it holds two 9 x 11 poly rv mats and two sets of Camco leveling blocks. This box was easily half the money of anything I could find in my area that was similar in size. If I recall correctly, it was shipped from California, so it took a little over a week to make it to me in New England..... about what I expected.

This this is a good size. What really worried me was that it looked ruff for some reason in the picture. But suprisingly it is is soft. I love how it feels. It would be awesome if they had different colors. It does take a bit more then a synthetic chamois but it's safer on the paint. The only thing is this feels a bit thin and will like to see how it holds up.

Owner of a 2018 Subaru Forester 2.5 Touring. I was hesitant on purchasing this because as the item name is its for a 2014 model. The subaru forester had a refresh for 2017/2018 models and I was a little afraid that the bumper may have changed. Luckily it has not and it fits well. This is OEM and came in an OEM package with the alcohol swabs. There are youtube videos to show how to install it or similar item on an Outback. So there should be no reason you cannot do it yourself.

The mats were purchased for my 2006 Impala SS because I was selling it and mine had gotten holes in it.Pros:The fitment of the mats was good, they sucked down in there pretty snuglyThey felt as if they would hold up to some good abusePrice - these are well priced to any competitionCons:They did not match the picture in the ad, was hoping for something more sharp, but the ones that came are more rounded with the "tread pattern"Not as rugged as the ones from weather-tech or the OEM factory, rubber is more flexibleAll in all they look alright, are hose washable, and will keep the interior from being messed up.  I will upload some pics I took from selling the car where they show up, though the mats were never the focus of the pictures.

The item came quickly but is NOTHING like the item depicted.  This will NOT directly replace the factory starter solenoid as there is no attached wire and the mounting bracket is all wrong...in fact the whole thing is all wrong.  In fact with the way this one is configured I don't think it would even fit in the factory location for my Polaris Sportsman 500 6x6 not to mention having to drill new holes if it did.

Inches matter.The minimum lift is just under 5".  You think that is good enough?  Low profile jacks are about 3.5".  Suppose you have a lowered car.  Suppose you have a flat tire.  This jack will not fit under your car if it has sports suspension and/or a flat tire.Maximum lift height is just under 1'.  Will that give you ground clearance?  Will that much lift be enough to raise your tire off the ground?  I have seen cars lifted 12" off the ground, only for the tire to stay on the pavement because of suspension travel.  A decent jack will give you a few more inches of lift.  Even 13" or 14" will make a world of difference when you can't change your flat tire.Specs don't look good on paper.  7" of lift is simply less than ideal.  Consider that a lot of jack stands have a minimum height of 11.5".  A lot of modern vehicles are higher profile and have ground clearance starting at 12",  Even unibody pinch welds on imports like Honda Pilot, Toyota Rav4, and Kia Sportage are about 1' off the ground or more.I wanted to like this jack.  But because of the limitations, I just couldn't.  For one, I couldn't use it.  Fully extended to 11.81", it raised the car less than my bottle jack.  This jack simply could not lift my little Ford Focus high enough to get the tire off the ground.  Imagine that!  If the tire is still on the pavement, you can't get the flat tire off, or install the spare tire.Be advised that hydraulic products are meant to be stored in an upright position.  When I order direct, hydraulic products are shipped by freight carrier, strapped to a pallet, with adequate packing and protection to keep it from being turned over and/or crushed.  When ordered online, packaging is never appropriate, the items roll and flip on conveyor belts, are tossed and jostled when handled, and are never handled properly.  2 out of 3 hydraulic products come missing parts, leaking hydraulic fluid, have excess air in the chambers, and are damaged.First thing that you want to do is make sure that everything is in the box.  Then wipe down every piece and part.  Purge excess air.  Refill oil to proper level.  Cycle the product several times to ensure that all parts are working properly.  Inspect for leaking at the seals and release valve.  Lubricate all moving and mechanical parts.  If cared for properly, a jack could last a lifetime.When all else fails, buy Craftsman or Torin, for known quality and reliability.

I want to love it - I really do.  I've had it now for about 6 months and it works pretty well once you get it working.  here's my issues with it:- the green rubber feet need to be harder. On my travel trailer, I have to clamp the bottle down.  With very little pressure the feet completely smashed down which smashes the unit and it stops reading.  PRO TIP - buy some ceiling fan balancing kits.  They have these really hard plastic clips that work PERFECT.  You have to trim them down to fit the bottle and squeeze them together so they stay put, but they work better than the green rubber feet the kit comes with.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Westinghouse-Lighting-77015-Fan-Blade-Balancing-Kit/dp/B00002NAJY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Westinghouse Lighting 77015 Fan Blade Balancing Kit</a>- I've already gone through a battery, it doesn't need to poll every second - that's too much and it wears the battery down too fast!- one of the magnets came unglued from the unit, I'm going to try and glue it back in- once the battery gets low, it stops reading - says my full tanks are empty.  Battery is at 10%.  That or my unit has failed...EDIT:  2/16/2017 - I have contacted AP Products and requested a warranty claim for the magnet coming out and the sensor not reading properly any longer.  We'll see...  I'll update my review when I know more.  I purchased my unit on July 19, 2016, so right at 7 months ago.EDIT:  7/26/2017 - Sorry for the delay in updating my review...About the magnet issue - that was the issue with the false readings. I tried re-gluing it, but it still did not read correctly. I contacted AP Products and I couldn't believe the customer service I received- amazing!!! They shipped me a new sensor no questions. Wonderful product support.I updated my review from 3 to 5 Stars - these ACTUALLY WORK and I love the simplicity of them. Add the incredible customer support and you've got a solid product.AP Products contacted me out of the blue after I had asked them about a better solution for the green rubber feet and said they had new aluminum ones they wanted to send me to try out. They work fantastic!!  If you get the green feet and need to clamp your bottle down (like in an RV rack) you'll need the aluminum feet.

Not bad for the price. Picked them up for my Camry. Toyota recommends cleaning the area of application first with "simple green" THEN with alcohol wipes. Once they're on that's it! If you peel it off and try to re-apply it all bets are off! You will weaken the adhesive bond considerably, and they will eventually fall off.

I bought the bigger ones from Safety Innovations and they were superb but too big for one of my applications, so I found these. They are perfect for areas where there may be interference with trim or something. They are nice quality, just not as "finished" as the Safety Innovations pieces but they work just fine. I am using them with the Northstates SuperGate pressure gate (another fine product!).

This is an excellent product to keep the heat and sun out of your RV.  We purchased this because our Thor RV has a roof vent in the bedroom that not only lets heat in, but the sunrise wakes us up early in the morning. Our vent was an inch on each side smaller than the insulator but it fit perfectly. As you can see by the picture, with the shades drawn, no light comes in our bedroom at all now. We have left it in while traveling to keep the room cooler and surprisingly, it's never fallen out no matter what type of road we are on.  It's well made, well insulated, and fits perfectly. There are no issues with the product quality and looks like it will last many years. This is a must have if you have roof vents.

It took a while to charge on a cell charger but it is fully charged now & I don't see me needing to charge it very often. It has so many features (portable charger, jump pack, 12v accessory port, & 7 different LED light modes. It also weighes no more than a 5 pound bag of sugar.

Pretty happy with the final result of this product. I did have to modify it due to the fact that my Jeep Wrangler bumper won't take the double sided sticky despite the fact that I thoroughly cleaned it with rubbing alcohol. Time will tell on the performance. I do like these better than the other brands due to the design which allowed me to drill a hole in both the mounts on the front side and attach it firmly and tastefully to my existing holes in my stock TJ Wrangler bumper. I went to the hardware store and picked up 2 carriage bolts along with two wing nuts for attaching the mounts more properly. Worked like a charm and looks flawless.  Now all I have to do is slip the whistles off for cleaning when need be and I don't have to worry about them not adhering. Would have given 5 stars but had to knock one for the fact that the sticky just isn't enough for highway speeds.

I received the hitch a few days ago and finally got up the courage to install it last night.  I've installed a few hitches on a few different vehicles in the past & they are, generally, bolt-n-go type assemblies.  This one requires a little more...The item arrived in a nice, oversized cardboard box secure inside by two wads of foam.  The instructions & hardware were securely taped to the receiver opening on the hitch.  The instructions are a simple, 1-page deal with only a handful of easy to understand steps.  The only step that was slightly unclear was the one pertaining to cutting the plastic skid plate/pan but more on that to come.  Hitch is well built & fairly hefty in weight.  The hardware was of proper size & all parts needed were included; including the pill wire but more on that to come.  The instructions are also available to download but here's a brief overview of what I did & what I can remember of the install:Remove the existing tow hooks under the front of the truck; 2 bolts each & they were firmly secured in there.  Cut opening in slid pan/plate.  I didn't clearly understand what part, or actually what direction, I was supposed to enlarge the plastic pan opening based on the directions since there were no pictures/images/illustrations so I took a little extra time to prop the hitch up to see.  It appears to only affect the two (small) plastic pans; one on left/right & not the main skid pan.  I removed both of those; 2 bolts & 2 screws each.  The plastic is soft & cut with relative ease using a sharp box cutter & tin snips.  I personally opened it up about 1" towards the front of the truck & about 1" towards the motor side of the opening.  Nut sure what purpose those two smaller pans serve (to the left/right of the main pan) - maybe they can be left off?  Quick re-install of both small plastic pans/guards.  Jacked the hitch up in place while balancing it on a small rolling jack (attempting the 1-person install).  Can be done with 1 person!  Two people would be faster/easier.  Once I got it in the general location, I installed (finger tight) the 4, 12mm bolts/washers.  Easy so far!  Torqued them to spec as noted in the 1-page instructions.  Next step required a drill.  Found a drill that fit the remaining hole thru the hitch.  Takes a 1/2" drill.  I suspect mine was closer to 17/32 or 9/16".  Whatever size it was, it was PERFECT!  Tip that worked for me:  Trying to drill thru the frame (using the hitch as the guide) can be tough, especially upside down in a fairly tight space.  I used my rolling floor jack, supported the butt of the cordless drill on the jack & jacked it up to provide lite pressure while drilling.  PERFECTION!The final step seems to cause the most grief & makes for the lower star ratings (which REALLY has nothing to do with the product itself).  As you can see by my pictures, they include a 'fish wire' that is setup for this intended purpose & appears to be well thought out.  The 'fish wire' attaches to  the coil of the bolt to pull it thru a small opening.  Took me less than 5 minutes to install BOTH bolts & here's what I did:Drill the holes (as noted above)Fish the wire, coil end first, thru the hole I just drilled & stuck my finger thru the access hole in the frame ~8-10" away to pull the coil thru.  This is the access hole that the cartridge bolt & plate will pull thru.Holding on to the loose end of the wire protruding thru the freshly drilled hole, I slide the square washer over the coil end of the fish wire & into the hole in the frame.  Gently screw the bolt to the coil (see pics below) till the bend in the coil touches the tip of the bolt.  Gently pull the loose end of the wire while feeding the bolt into the hole in the frame.  GENTLY pull on the fish wire & wiggle a little as needed till the bolt starts to come thru the hole.Twist the bolt a little till you fell the carriage head engage the plate.  Gently unscrew the fish wire from the bolt while gently applying a little downward pressure to keep the bolt seated.  Install the nut & torque to spec.Repeat on the other side.Total install time was about 1 hour!  Hitch is SECURE.  Sticker notes it is rated for 5000# towing & 9000# straight pull.  Has two large pull rings.  Happy with the install.  Happy I chose this over the other, which based on other reviews notes you have to remove the skid plate/pan.

I had a simple goal in mind with this purchase. I wanted to protect the semi-gloss luster of my beautiful, brand new weekender Cenzo Duffle Bag. Leather Honey Conditioner is non-toxic and water repellent, and I like the fact that I can apply by hand, massaging it into the leather. I took a photo 24 hours after applying the conditioner. It did not darken the leather, though it somehow looks richer. Its also important to me that my new Italian leather feels like leather  soft, supple, and flexible. But, just as important, it must be durable enough to withstand the changing seasons. LH further impressed me when my wife applied it to her extensive Dooney & Bourke collection of fine leather handbags and accessories. They now look and feel better than new. Highly recommended.

Happy with the purchase installed without much trouble onto my 2012 Toyota Sienna.  It seems solid with good powder coated back finish.  I especially like how this hitch is 100% as close and snug to the bottom of the van as is possible.Installation requires cutting the plastic spash guard that protects the van's back underside, and cutting feels a bit like a blind shot in the dark.  I would have paid more if the kit included a simple paper template that lines up with the splash guard if it would have facilitated a smaller, cleaner cut.Nevertheless I am happy with the purchase.

I had high expectations after reading hundreds of good reviews but was sadly disappointed after receiving a set for Chrsitmas. I have H7 projector lenses with a very crisp cutoff and these bulbs had a very bad black spot right where the beam should be the most intense and had a weird flare of light above the cutoff.  I'll be switching back to my Halogen bulbs as these are basically use less for light output. I believe the black spot is caused by the size of the base inside the housing that blocks light from making it out the center of the projector.  The product itself was very nice and came with all the wiring adapters you need and even zipties. In a tight H7 projector they just did not perform as expected.

Just like the real thing... it looks great!I had to place it closer to the "Carrera" logo on my car to keep it somewhat "centered"... otherwise, if i separated the "S" further way, it would be badly off-centered.I put tiny drops of gorilla glue, after cleaning the area, and applied pressure for at minute or more... it sticks well so far, it's been 2+ weeks. I'll update when it falls off...

The packaging that this came in was laughable - see the picture.  Bought two and they both came that way, however, I don't care what you call it as long as it works.  I got a good laugh out of the name.  Anyway, can't say anyone has tried to steal my trailers, however, these seem like they'll do the job.  If anything, they are a great visual deterrent.  The clamped onto my trailer wheels (2 different sizes) without any issues, however, its a little looser than I expected.  Not so loose that someone can remove it, but loose enough that they might try.  Can't speak to durability, yet, but for the price I am satisfied with what we received and think it'll serve its purpose just fine.

I had several exhaust manifold leaks at the heads while using the oem style gaskets. I heard from a few fellow gear heads taht REMFLEX makes great stuff. I bought the manifold and collector gaskets, removed old gaskets, cleaned all contact surfaces on the headers and heads, mput new gasket on and torqued bolts to stock spec. The best part about these gaskets are that they are made of graphite, once you torque down, they do not shrink due to heat cycles from the engine. They compress from the torque and actually press back against the headers creating a perfect seal and eliminating any leaks and even better, elminating the need to go back after a few weeks to re torque the manifold bolts. These are perfect for after market headers!!

Easy to install, and looks great on my 2018 JKU. Only gets 4 stars because the installation parts kit sucks. The screws didn't fit correctly and the spacers are white.

Like the slightly more aggressive look that the wheel spacers give my truck. I feel as they should've/could've stuck out more. But, good product. After installation I drove about 1 week a little over 100 miles and no problems yet. However next week I probably will take my tires off and retorque just to insure safety.

The springs do one thing only, they pull the screen door closed, they do not control closing speed or latch speed. I tried one spring at first and found that it was not enough to hold the door from remaining slightly open if it didn't latch. Two springs and the door actually follows you when entering, and provides quick closing motion from any position when exiting. Also be sure to install the springs in such a way that they do not drag across any part of the frame or door or you'll get a twanging boing with a buzz. The 9" dimension is perfect. I put lengths of straws on each to help quiet them. I like the interaction now because the door actually feels like it prefers to be closed without being overpowering. Not enough tension to close the outer door but who cares, it's the perfect solution to the annoying screen door.

We have a one year old who was till now sitting rear facing in the car but now he is front facing. We initially kept his car seat in middle section on the backseat but since we want to put an iPad / tablet holder in front of him (for long trips) we are now gonna keep his seat on window side (one which has child lock).Now putting his seat behind me would be good and with a tablet in front of him with his favorite rhymes he is golden, but this brings all together another issue. With him growing in height as well, his legs are now beginning to reach the front seat's back portion. With his shoes, I can expect my seat's upholstery to get soiled and dirty if he keeps hitting them with his legs. In order to ensure that the seats are not messed up, we got these car seat kick mats.I like that these are black in color as dark colors tend to hide the dirt more so even when the mat is dirty, it won't show up much. They are of plasticky material and not cloth so dirt won't seep inside them and cleaning them is just matter of wiping with damp cloth. On the top of the kick mat, you have a buckle like arrangement with which you can loop around the front seat's headrest to make it hang from there. At the bottom is an elastic loop running through entire width of the mat. I like this arrangement for better than my existing car organizer as in my car, in bottom area, there is no much place to fix loop on both sides but with this arrangement, I can just put the kick mat from top of seat to bottom and it will stay there. Not sure if I was able to explain but I will let you see in pictures.In the package you get 2 kick mats for the 2 front seats. With this in the car, I am content that my car's upholstery won't get much dirty and this is a cheaper solution than getting new covers made. Also additionally you have mesh pockets in this car mat on its top. This can be used to keep small toys or small containers with cookies etc for the child.Overall this is a very good car kick mat which you should buy if you don't want your seats to become dirty due to kids kicking their backs with their footwear.*I was provided a sample of this product for evaluation purpose and all opinions expressed are my own based on my usage of the product.

This thing has proven to be solid. I have owned this for 3 years now and it has withstood everything I and mother nature has tossed at it.  I use it to primarily to lift and lower my plow, in Michigan's U.P. this is no small feat.  Temps often dropping in the sub zero range and packed full of ice and snow this winch performs flawlessly. With the constant cycling of raising and lowering the blade there has been no issues with the winch at all.  It usually takes me an hour or 2 of plowing depending on the snow this is a lot of cycling on the motor, solenoid, and switch.  I have used this winch on occasion to recover my machine and others.  In one instance tried to remove a side-by-side for a pit I anchored my machine to a tree while winching the side-by-side to the point of pulling damaging his recovery hook.  After setting up better we were able to remove the machine.  In this time of abuse I have only recently replaced the fairlead and rocker switch. The fairlead was damaged from over tensioning of the cable and the cable was as well. I do not consider that to be the fault of the manufacture but of my own negligence.  The switch did wear out but this would be expected with the continued use from plowing.  I did replace both the switch and fairlead with KFI parts I guess time will tell if they hold up like the originals.Its now 2018 and I originally purchased this in 2013.  This winch is not showing any sign of quitting.

OVERVIEWI was excited to recieve these after only seeing non blackout options on the market. I have a 2008 wrangler and had to wait 8 years with multiple transparent smoke coatings. They look great and I am pleased. I even paired them up with the matching third brake light by u-box.INSTALLATIONI installed both rear tai lights in two minutes. Each tail light has four total screws. Two actually attach the housing to the jeep and the other two adjust the far edge of the housing. They were identical fits, lining right up on the shadow or dust line where the stock housings sat. The housing wire harness connection receiver matched right up with the power harness just like the old one.COLORThe red LEDs are probably brighter than the stock bulb and the appear like individual red dots at close but blur together in a red glow from a further distance.REFLECTORSThe red colored areas are reflectors. On the outside of the housing the reflector stands out slightly. If you have a tightly fitting protective cage on your housing this may or may not impact the fitting of them. See the attached photos. One of the packaged product, one of the old stock lights, and a few of the new lights off or on.PRICE$$-$$$ out of $$$$$. These are the best priced blackout LED lights but when compared to other LED styles they are around mid to slightly below the mid average price.

I now own two of these, and they are on both my bikes. Heavy duty,  and strong.  Solid metal,  no hollow cheap stuff here. Nice, smooth mirror chromed finish. Do be aware you may need washers when mounting because the area where the bolts go in is fairly small.

I absolutely LOVE this cover!  This is the first time I've ever posted a picture for a review.  I felt that this product was deserving of one!  I have a Jeep Sahara and this fit perfectly!  It is so cute with the paw prints instead of the "e" in jeep.  It is very well made!  High quality!!!  Just slips right on and fit snuggly and securely.  Comfortable for my arm and also protects my console from begin scratched by my dogs paws or other things.  I highly recommend this product!  I did receive it at a slight discount for my honest review and I am so happy to review it!  Definite five star product!  I would buy again for sure!  You will not be disappointed!

This kit works great in my 04 Accord coupe. Easy to install, and the lights are bright and clear. You can see the stock light on the left, and the new LED on the right. The LED's are about the same brightness as the stock lights, but with a nice bright white light.

I purchased this to replace the tri-bar light that I had that had cracked. The product arrived on time, and I installed it the following day, March 19. I haven't gone through an entire tank of gas with this light installed (weather hasn't been playing nice), and there are already at least seven LEDs completely out and five that are intermittent. Like all cheaper than OEM products you buy like this you roll the dice. Win some, lose some. I lost this round. I'm going to purchase the other tri-bar light that's here on Amazon. Maybe I'll have better luck with that one.I didn't give the light one star simply because it does fit well and looks nice. All of the LEDs on the bottom that illuminate the license plate work great. I wish could say the same for the ones that really count.

My GF installed these on my 07 FJ. My OEM rotors were shot and couldn't be turned anymore. The rotors were warped and it was shaking worse than Hillary at a NRA convention at speeds 55+. After doing some research and reading reviews, I contacted the company and was impressed with their product knowledge and professionalism so I decided to buy these PowerStop rotors and pads. They arrived in 2 days thanks to Prime. The day they arrived, I had to fly to Amsterdam the next day for business. When I returned 2 weeks later, my GF said she installed the rotors and pads all by herself watching youtube videos and reading the forums. She said the hardest part was removing and installing the 35 Nitto tires lol....but she did it. She said the install was very easy and she didn't have any problems with the pesky Toyota calipers that are known to seize on the lower inside piston. She even followed the directions listed on the box to properly seat and bed the pads to the rotors. Time will tell how long they will last but so far they are doing great with minimal brake dust. I have the best GF ever and who knows how to turn wrenches while looking pretty. I gave her a special treat for surprising me and taking care of my FJ

First off, let me start by saying that I have tried other , cheaper LED bulbs in my 2015 VW GTI. All of them threw error lights that would have required coding with VCDS  to kill the light.These bulbs are BRIGHT. They replace the halogen bulbs I had in my reverse lights and are as bright, if not brighter than the halogens. They can only be placed one of two ways in the harness so check fitment and test the lights before you put everything back together again.For the price, I would recommend these over significantly more expensive LED bulbs offered by some VW tuning sites.

They really look good.  Nice dress up item.I only use mine for diagnostic purposes but if I had a show car it would look great.The first one I got the temp was way off so they sent me another one quickly.  Very impressed as had along time to return the first one NC.The second one was dead on accurate but I found it leaked around the top seal (by lifting up the overflow) so had to bend the hold downs slightly so it would seal and siphon the water back into the radiator when it cooled down.Now it works and looks perfectly.  A real bargain too. A great check for the inaccurate gages in some cars today!!Due to the attractive smooth shape it can be a little hard to remove by hand - especially when hot.  I used a open wrench with a rag to protect the pretty chrome.

This stuff isn't quite as magical as I would like, but it really does a good job of hiding weathered areas on trim to give it a uniform appearance.It is a black liquid that reminds me of wood stain in the way it lays down and spreads. While it is black, don't confuse it with a dye. Black it is; dye it is not.It has its fall backs. This doesn't do much to smooth hard plastic trim. I used this first on my Tacoma fender flares witb really lackluster results. I cleaned and degreased and the prep was on point but it doesn't soak in. At first I was really disappointed. It just laid over the top of the plastic and wiped right off revealing the same graying plastic below.I wanted to give it a second chance, and used it on the more porous, textured trim on our Mini Cooper Paceman and I was amazed!The Mini trim was starting to show banding (from the molding process) and a tad bit of sun fading in spots. Simply applying dressing would make the trim darker, but it wouldnt hide the banding effect. This stuff hid it all on the first go around. I was super impressed.It also did a wonderful job on the cowl plastic by the windshield and the wiper arms look brand new.Once you buff off the excess, the trim gains a dark satin sheen that looks great. Especially nice is that all the plastic has a uniform color again.Being solvent based, I anticipate that water repelling won't be a problem. Judging by other reviews, I expect this to last thru the summer and I will reapply this fall.Enjoy a couple of pictures!Pros: satin sheen, dark uniform appearanceCons: hard to work with, messy, must be buffed off very well.

I carefully read the enclosed instructions that ShadowMajik sent me with the two autobot decals I purchased. After much debate, I finally placed in on the bottom right of my back window. It looks awesome!Installation* It's fairly self-explanatory if you read the instructions. You basically peel of the solid backing first, and then place decal over the cleaned but lightly misted surface. Afterwards you begin to position how you want to place the decal and squeeze out air bubbles and water from center out. For me, I left it there in the warm temperature for a while before removing the translucent paper. It sticks on perfectly and generally took me less than 10-15 minutes!Appearance* I like the chrome look. It's got a subtle but still flashy nature to the color. I have a silver car, and I personally think it looks good together. However, I'm certain it will look great on any car. Do look into the black and white colors of this decal as well.Value* Man, for something that's going to make my car look that much cooler, nicer (insert your favorite adjective), this is a bargain.All for less than $2. Great deal.Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this decal and it's ease of installation. Autobots: roll out!

Picture Descriptions:1 & 2) Comparing OEM bulb to new bulb in the dark and light (LED on the right if that wasn't insanely obvious :D)3) Both bulbs installed, showing the difference between the switchback colors (very crisp)4) Just showing that the amber signal turns fully off between flashes, making it even more obviousThis is by no means my first pair of replacement LED bulbs on a vehicle, but it is my first switchback LEDs, and as such I didn't fully know what to expect. I typically purchase JDM ASTAR LEDs because I've been impressed by their quality, lifespan, and customer service in the past. These bulbs are no exception to their great reputation and if you're on the fence about trying out switchbacks then just check out my pictures -- the difference between the OEM bulbs is great enough, but the crisp difference between the white DRL and the amber turn signal just feels like I'm reaching out to anyone in front of my vehicle and yelling "I'M DEFINITELY TURNING".A couple things to note when purchasing these bulbs:1) They are almost a full inch longer than the OEM turn signal bulbs -- I really don't see any modern headlights having issue with the bulbs being too long, but it's worth noting.2) You WILL need an resistor installed inline with these bulbs if you're replacing an incandescent bulb.3) Take pictures!! I'm sure tons of people would love to see what your rig looks like after installing these bad boys, especially for reference if they have the same car.

I bought this because my car seat (2012 Subaru Outback) has zero lumbar support. I can't remember if it ever had one or it just wore away. I spend at least 2 hours per workday commuting in the car and it takes a toll after a while. While I like it, it took a bit for me to get it situated where I wanted it to and every time I would get into the car it would take at least 10-15 minutes to get adjusted to it. Without a neck support, while it was certainly giving me lumbar support, my head would still be back and my belly shoved forward and it's a strange seating position unless i spent the whole commute pushing backwards with my body. Also it pushes me forward in the seat so that my thighs no longer get any thigh support from my chair.I have it for when I need it but right now it hangs from the back of my seat...about to go on a vacation and will buy the neck pillow and see if it helps at all.

Purchased from i6Motorworks.If you have over 60,000 miles and have never changed this out or if you are doing a valve cover gasket job, this kit is a must.  The original material in the VANOS, Buna, is known to deteriorate over time.  Even if you get a brand-new VANOS for your BMW, the seals and o-rings will still be made with the original material.  This is a well documented problem.  This is where Teflon comes into play.  It supposedly lasts a lifetime and once you change out the seals and o-rings, you never have to do it again.  You will also get a nice MPG boost once these are changed.Furthermore, if you are doing the valve cover gasket, you might as well knock this maintenance item out.  The procedure to remove the valve cover gasket is also required when doing the VANOS since it is under the valve cover.On to the seller and the product itself.First, must say that this product is a great deal for the amount of stuff that you get.  The teflon and o-rings alone go for $40 at some places.Second, the item shipped missing one set of the teflon and o-rings.  Since this is dual vanos and also based on the picture, you should receive two.  I notified the seller, i6Motorworks, and sent him a picture of the unopened product (it's all on a piece of cardboard that is sealed with plastic) and he promptly sent out the item.  Not only did he send me the one that I was missing, he also sent an extra set.i6Motorworks has fast delivery with excellent customer service.  Will certainly do business with them again.Installed and no leaks so far!

I am on my third ACDO Cover and these things are essentially disposable.  A decent cover should last more then a couple of years.  Each of my covers have disintegrate in about three years, in mild climate San Diego no less.  The cover I have now, this model, with the white Tyvek roof has a major design flaw.  The Tyvek roof panel is not a single panel is it actually three panels of Tyvek sewn together, see picture.  The problem is these seams are on the roof surface and continually exposed to the sun.  All the weight of the sides goes through each of the white panel seams, the Tyvek (white part) is much lighter weight then the side panels and it cannot handle it.  Also the thread used is not rated for UV light and the elements and it rots.  The weight of the cover and two seams on the roof surface where there should be none and a thread that rots in a couple of years and this cover is off to the landfill.Bottom line:  My third cover is falling apart; again and it should never have happened. There has got to be something better out there, get it together ADCO.

These LED bulbs are bright, and put out a bright white light. They are certainly brighter than the stock incandescent bulbs that were in my Subaru Forester. I replaced all my interior lighting with these. They also dim, both a slight dimming when I close the door, but also a full dimming to shut off when I start the car or lock it. No issues at all. Amazing price too.

Great product.  Installed on a 1999 Jeep Wrangler.  Make sure to measure your old rotor before ordering and installing when you have the 99.  These rotors have the 2.75" depth for the later model TJ.  Any 1999 TJ could be either the early (3" depth) or late (2.75" depth) brake type and needs measurement.  These rotors fit perfectly and used with the Black Magic Brake Pads work great.  Could not recommend this setup more highly.

My wife had bought this for her 2016 Honda Accord and I was skeptical because you had to hand stitch. Sure enough after it was done I fell in love and bought one for my 2011 Accord. It makes it look super nice and it's super comfy. Had bought one that was about $5 more but it was super hard to stitch so I recommend this one!

Omg! I just put the Gibson Exhaust in my 2015 Wrangler Altitude.  If you have a Jeep I highly recommend it. Easy install, really pull the old muffler off, and slide the Gibson on. The sound of this exhaust is the balls, nice and deep low growl. It really set you apart from the rest. I also got the Banks Air Intake, this really makes it a beast! I don't know how much the horse power increased, but you can feel the difference. When your talking about horsepower who cares about MPG lol.

This is not really for a TJ.  the lower bolts it shows in the directions, put the mirror too far down and back.  It also looks like it would be in the way of the doors but i didn't check. (see attached)  The upper bolts like on the JK are at the wrong angle and the mount blocks your doors from coming off.  I had to get out my metal tools and re-drill the holes on the pole to the correct angle for the upper bolts, and then cut the bottom of the mount to clear the door.  both leave exposed steel that will rust. (I forgot to take a pic, ill add later if I can).  Also in a normal set of mirrors, the passenger side glass is adjusted to compensate for the distance (hence the "objects in mirror are closer than they appear") but these are the same on both sides.  approaching cars are giant in the passenger side mirror.3 stars instead of 1 or 2 because overall I like them better than the ones on the door that moved every time i shut the door, and it only took 15 minutes for the metal work (because I had my tools already set up)

Did not work in my 09 Avalanche. I am not sure if I may have gotten a bad set , I tested the sockets, swapped them back and forth and reversed/ flipped  the bulbs, and they still didn't work. I have nothing but JDM ASTAR  LED's in the rest of my truck and I couldn't be happier  they have great Customer Service usually and I tried contacting them but never heard back!!!  so I am a little disappointed that they didn't work.UpdateI got them to work, afterwards I also replaced my tai lights with the LED SpydersThese Reverse bulbs are brighter than my headlights!

UPDATE:After having the antenna on my car for a couple of month it has changes color.  The carbon fiber look is still there but now instead of being black in the other parts (top and bottom) it has turned to a copper color.  Doesn't both me much as I still think the shorty antenna is a cool look but this is a little disappointing.  If I were to purchase this again I would coat it in some UV resistant clear coat.Not too much to say about this, it's an antenna for your car.  What there is to say is that it looks awesome on my truck (2006 Toyota Tacoma)! There are other shorty style antennas out there and most of the reviews I read said that the users lost all ability to pick up radio signal with those other ones, not the case with this little guy.I install the antenna and immediately hopped in the car and turned on the radio and was able to pick up all my presets with ease.  All channels came in clear and I couldn't tell a difference in reception between this one and the factory antenna.I like the short style of the antenna, I just hope that no one else likes it enough to steal it.  I will be putting some loctite on this tomorrow after work when I can make it to the hardware store.The antenna comes with 4 different size antenna adapters and 2 rubber spacers.  I didn't need to use the spacers and the antenna sits pretty close to the same position as the factory antenna.  I think the reason why this antenna does have good reception is because it is an aluminum antenna with carbon fiber accents.Overall I would recommend this to anyone looking to change things up and add a bit of style to their car or truck.Only complaint is that the TRD logo looks a little fuzzy, not a deal breaker, just something I noticed.I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest review.

The Airtex fuel pump is exactly what I was looking for, Works on 6 volt systems on older cars. It puts out an adequate amount of fuel, comes with all the necessary parts to hook up to most systems, and is easily mounted .The included fuel filter is kind of flimsy and is easily crushed, which happened to me when trying to seal and tighten the threads. Instead of taking the chance of internal damage not evident , i replaced it with a see thru plastic filter to monitor the filters contents. Easy fix

I've tried many other wax polishing products from many different companies. Yet this product makes my car pop in a way others haven't. Used with the Duragloss 601 bonding agent, this wax went on fairly easy. Took about an hour and half to do the entire car, both bonding agent and wax, and the results were outstanding. I've read on many sites how experienced car detailers use this product over others, and I can see why. Recently had a full weekend of rain and car was left almost clean, with little to no water spots on the car, the chrome yes, but was a lot quicker to clean. Every Friday, meaning once a week, I use Mothers Spray Wax: MOTHERS 05724 California Gold Spray Wax - 24 oz and apply it to the entire car to continue maintaining that showroom shine. During the week if the car gets dirty, dust, bird droppings, etc, I will use Duragloss 921 Automotive Fast Clean and Shine - 22 oz. and the car continues to look like tons of hours of work put in to create that shine, when in essence it's about 30 minutes total worth of work. Don't know about the durability of the product, states one wax can last a year, but I'll break it down to every 6 months to be sure I get that shine I love so much. Totally recommend this to anyone wanting their car to stand out. This is now my go to wax! Pictures I uploaded show how much color pops out using this stuff..

Ordered the wrong size, 41mm vs 38mm but with the addition of rubber strips in the clamp actually makes the unit more secure. Used these to mount my head light, drive and turn signal lights. Very solid and look great.

The bulbs seem well made. Installation on my car was a bit of a pain, not the bulbs fault. But once installed, the light was white, and brightness seems improved over the old incandescent bulbs that were there before. Only reason I wend LED was because these are a pain to get to, and hopefully these last so I don't have to do them again.

Bought these in February and just opened package a few days ago to install them. seems as though there was sand or something "gritty" all over them in the package, the result.....the rear ones look like they are 5 years old, all scratched up and crappy. not happy but i was pretty sure i wouldn't be able to return them as i bought them in February and its now April. Notice in the pics how it's all "chewed up" around the outside edge. I don't even have the "contact seller" option for this. Very aggravating.

This evening after work I cleaned the MAF and throttle body on my 1994 Nissan D21 "Hardbody" with the kit shown here.They both seemed to do good enough, and I had enough left over for probably 2 more cleanings. (FYI: Clean at every air filter change)Those two bottles shown in the picture, however, are much smaller than you'd probably think. They are about the height of a 12 oz beer can.Ask me how I know!

Used for a solar gate opener. It's not quite sealed tight enough to keep bugs out of it (i placed bug powder in it to keep it bug free) and the tiny vents in the top I sealed with silicone so it wouldn't very gradually fill with water. Overall for price though I'm happy.

Pumps fluid. Does take about 30-50 pumps per quart. And the hose has trouble reaching the bottom of the bottle (0.2 quarts left). Squeeze bottom of bottle and you'll be ok.Warmer gear oil is easier to pump / drain.Would've liked: more fluid per pump and a longer hose to hit the bottom of the bottle.Literally impossible to do some of these fluid changes without it.Next best option is buy a very long length of cheap vynl / plastic hose from home depot and attach it to the gear oil bottle and put it inside the fill hole and turn the bottle upside down while standing next to the car.Another cool opction would be hooking up a 12v electric fish pump to your battery and pumping oil with it.Ps don't use walmart oil for hypoid differentials.

Always looking to add mods here and there and this is a cheap mod that takes maybe 30 mins to get done. The LEDS are really bright. The frame is plastic. I read a previous review and followed his instructions for wiring. I used the white wire for positive, and black for ground, and just tapped in to the license plate light. Fords for the most part use the brown wire for the running lights thier trucks. Like I said was a simple mod and the holes were already there from the factory so I thought why not...

after having these sitting on my work bench for almost 2 years I decided to install them. Big mistake. What a waste of my time. First of all the didn't really fit me Head Lamps very well. At this point I should have stopped. Wiring was a big PIA since I also had to install some additional wiring since my car is old. I suspected the wire crimp joints. Got the installed and drivers side worked for about 1 minute and then quit. Pass side was ok. Removed pass side to make an adjustment and test voltage. The freaking wire pulled out of the bulb housing.  Don't waist your money.

a bit tricky to figure out how to set them, but once you get the hang of it, it's not that bad. a good design. I used these on a 1995 f150 Lightning that I raised slightly in the front (.61 inches) with urethane spring bushings.  I took a guess at the right setting, drove the truck, had excessive steering effort, tried other settings, and finally got it right (third try), steers like new and tires look like they are sitting correctly... I'm sure installing these and then taking it to the dealer for an alignment would have been easier, and eventually that's what will happen, but until I get new tires, it seems to steer and drive fine where I have it. great product.

Great product, works as advertised. I purchased this grit guard because I am trying to prepare myself for future quality car washes with the vehicles I have at my house to reduce the scratches and swirl marks that get pushed into the paint. I purchased a blue one because I have a yellow 5 gallon bucket, making it extremely easy to see the dirt that gets trapped at the bottom of the bucket because of these bright color combinations I have going on.

Low quality.  The passenger side ripped clean off when my 110lb 4'8" mom tried to use it as assistance to get up into the jeep so not even full weight she fell to the dirt.  I then tested my side ripped it clean off with little effort the nylon strap ripped almost as easy as duct tape.  I then tried back seat grab bars those ripped off to not as easy but still you should be able to tear thes off with little effort. JUNK!

Hitch is made very strong.  Fits perfectly however, with the receiver box mounted on the bottom of the cross bar the stock hight vehicle's ground clearance is reduced to 10" and the entry angle is severely reduced.  If the receiver box were even with the cross bar or on top it would be perfect. As is it would be best on a lifted truck.

Got this to hook up christmas lights to the rear of the vehicle. Plug didn't work; upon opening it up the grounding wire was not soldered to the ground causing a non contact issue.The entire assembly is also slightly smaller than the regular 7 port adapter used for the trailer. So with that issue the entire plug has some play in it causing it to not make contact all the time.

Leather is very good quality. It looked and felt good on my hands after installation. I did do the bead installation a little different. The rest of my review is my solution to a slight problem I was having. The picture will show what the problem was after a short ride but at highway speeds. To counteract that action I trimmed the fringe back 1 inch at a time until I could ride without the particular problem happening again. I took off 3 inches before they settled down. This is on a HD Ultra Limited. You may have different results with a different model. I am still happy with my purchase.

Cheap!!!!! Barely went on a 300 trip and the Velcro is coming off. It was on a cargo rack on my Wrangler which doesn't go fast at all so I don't think excessive speed is a factor. Gave it 3 stars because I can still gorilla glue the Velcro pieces I guess but geez!! I'll give it another go around on another trip and hope my stuff doesn't end up on the freeway! Also for sizing the junior was a really good size for weekend travel. It held 2 duffle bags, 2 sleeping bags, a pillow, pair of ski jacket and pants and two pairs of snow boots. I think I still had room to work with, any bigger bag would be overkill.

Unbelievably bright ! I'm very pleased with the light intensity. The bar pulls only about 9 amps putting the true Watt rating closer to 100w than 300w. That is a good thing though, it means this bar is VERY energy efficient. That makes the circuit requirement less expensive too. The curve matches the curve of my 2015 Frontier's front bumper very closely ( Yeah !). It will be a while before I can get it installed but I'll update, including photos, when I do. I am going to install a redundant safety switch for it. You REALLY DON'T want to accidentally activate it. I've already ordered the parts and will post a schematic and operational photo's when I update.

Ok they aren't that high end led bars you see for 5x the price but they look good reason I'm giving 4 out of 5 is quality control. There's like specks of debri in couple of the lights. Couldnt get a detailed pic to see debri. Will see how they last I think California is done with wet weather so can't give detail about waterproof. Oh and the mounting system is different from pictured on Amazon, it's a single mount which I see as a pro and con. Pro your able to position light easily, and only one hole to drill that's big plus. A possible con I can't prove but maybe weaker, only time will tell. They seem sturdy and would recommend them for low budget lighting.

This is by far the best car polish I've ever used at any price. Goes on easy and best of all comes off easy. Does a great job of taking off road oils dirt as well. My truck is new and the dealership did wax it before I picked it up but after reading the reviews on this polish I decided to wax it again for added protection from the heat,sun and humidity we have in south Louisiana. Not sure what they used at the dealership but the end results paled in it's ability to make my truck shine.

Best price ($110 shipped) I've seen for these. Quality product, fits great, sturdy, good instructions w/cutting template, shipped fast. Install wasn't too bad if you have the tools. I painted mine to match my Jeeps paint, turned out great. Definitely lets the hot air out, even when stopped (hence the "caution hot air" stencil I made, matches my Military theme). I didn't have any issues with the screws/length like some posted. I'm happy with the product and results.

I bought this on the suggestion of the people on audizine.com and had considered another product but honestly, I'm really impressed with it.  The brakes on my 2013 S4 are amazing, but throw so much brake dust it's insane.  This works 100% as advertised, spray it on and watch it change colors.The bottle says you should just rinse, but I found using soapy wheel brushes to agitate the dust really helps out, then rinse and rinse and then rinse some more, you want all this stuff off your wheels.  It also works really well to clean brake calibers and wheel wells.If you have larger wheels, like the 19's on my car, and have small openings in the wheels, buy a few bottles of this stuff, you'll go through it quickly.I found it best to spray down two wheels at once, and go between them.  I also sprayed it directly on cool wheels, in the shade, without rinsing first.  The Internet will tell you it's a coin flip between rinsing down with water first, then applying Sonax, while others will tell you that waters down the Sonax.  The jury is still out on this.

The inside where the rope rides is very rough, and had a sharp edge. Took about an hour with some 120, 240, 320 grit sandpaper to smooth it out. Also the bolts they shipped with it are to long for my KFI mount, the bolts hit the drum. The way the heads are countersunk makes it difficult to find different bolts so I just shortened them. I would recommend spending a few extra bucks and gets different brand.Thanks to the USPS losing the first one for 4 weeks I have two of these and they are both of the same poor quality.

This is an easy inexpensive way to protect something so expensive.

I bought this small roll bag for a smaller bike (Suzuki S40) and it fits nicely with the lines of the bike.Well made piece but a couple of things I'd add.The inside mesh pockets could be bigger...they only go up about half way and it would be nice if they went all the way up the sides. They should include a shoulder strap to use to carry the bag around on it's edge but I just stuffed a small laptop strap inside for that. The handle serves it's purpose but seems like it could put stress on the main zipper compartment.Don't get me wrong...it works well for carrying stuff like light rain gear to/from the office and short trips around town and it mounts really well to the sissy bar and back seat...solid and goes on/off fast!In fact, I'll probably buy either the large roll bag or the overnight bag to use for more capacity since they are a bit stiffer than this bag and this will attach to the top but it still holds it's shape very well.The mounting system is really slick for the Dowco bags.

This product is way better than my stock horn on my 2005 Jeep grand Cherokee, which always sounded kind of girly to me. In deep water or when hitting puddles, water would shoot into my stock horn as it was right by the tire well -  then it would sound like a 12-year-old boy going through puberty. I installed these higher up in the engine compartment and now they stay dry and sound amazing!  Highly recommend.

No issues with it so far.... works perfectly for 2010 fatboy lo.So I have now used this several times and have no issues with it. Some guys keep saying that this is unstable and then I read that they have extended it completely to the top. Come on now that just sounds silly to me. No reason to extend the lift to its max. I was able to lift the rear end high enough with this lift without removing the fender. For what I paid for it and what my use is going to be it works out perfectly.

These are fantastic led boat lights. They are a 1004 bulb and will only fit fixtures designed for that bulb. They are brighter then the traditional cheap bulbs and draw very little power allowing me to be out on the water a lot longer at night with more confidence in my battery life. They produce little to no heat, so no worries about getting burned like a traditional light would.Anyone relying on just a deep cycle trolling motor battery to operate, these are a 100% must have item!Please see my pictures

**9/1/2017 update2 or 3 times recently I've had an issue where my parking lights came on (or in one class slowly blinked).  I was near my vehicle when this occured, and it was shortly after i had locked and walked away.  I press lock (or unlock) again to resolve.  I'm pretty sure that it's related to this unit, but it could be a connection issue. If it becomes more common i can look.  I'd think it may be a bad relay? not enough to worry about right now.  Downgrading from 5 to 4.. and I've added photos of the wiring diagrams for anyone looking for them...** Original Review 11/2016Nice, basic, keyless entry system for a great price.  I have a 1986 C10 Silverado (with power locks) that my grandfather bought new.  I'm cleaning up and restoring it, and took my wife out for dinner and to the hardware store (for her ironically), and kept having to use the KEY to unlock the door like a heathen.  This truck may be 30 years old, but it's 2016.  I need a button to push.  I did a little digging and decided to get this cheap solution to my problem.I got this installed today.  Works great, ONCE you figure out how to hook it up.  If you wire up your parking lights, Lock blinks once, unlock twice. Press and hold lock blinks once, pauses, then blinks 10 times (vehicle locator).  The blinks are very short.  I'd prefer a little longer, but that of course is subjective.  You could hook up your horn as well, but i didn't.  Range seems fine - if i test full range outside i will update. I was able to do it from about 30 feet away through 3 interior wall.Search youtube for keyless entry in 1986 c10 to see it in action.Comes with 2 key fobs, which seem to be of good quality.  feel sturdy and thick, and the buttons are substantial.  Doesn't feel cheap at all. A little blue LED on the fob lights when you press the button.The instructions are poorly translated, and its hard to tell which wire set up to use.  In my case, i used NONE of the example wiring (though i tried all the ones that look applicable), and instead wired the Lock and unlock outputs directly to my SWITCH wires as opposed to the electric lock actuator.  This makes the system mimic a pressing lock/unlock in the door, as opposed to sending 12v straight to the lock (which doesn't work on this truck). Obviously they can't provide instructions for every car out there, but i feel like an old chevy truck is pretty basic.I hooked up lock, unlock, the 3 12v leads (unit power and lock/unlock), the ground, and brown to parking lights (so 7 wires from the unit to 5 wires on the truck as the 12v leads all 3 are connected together to constant 12v.  It also has outputs for trunk and window, which i didn't use...

This is an Excellent tool, a must for any garage or car repair service. Don't let the small size fool you this little Battery tester works both as a stand alone tester or for complete details using the OTC App that works with Apple and Android products. Using this alone simply connect it to your battery, installed in a car or not the LCD screen shows Battery Voltage, CCA (cold cranking Amps) type of battery Wet Acid, AGM the battery type is shown on the display. If the battery is installed in a car the display will show when its ready to test the starter load and charging system condition. I must say I have modern Battery testers 4 times the size at a comparable cost that don't give instant details like this does. Using the App is simple, no need to connect via wifi or blue tooth this unit displays a barcode that you scan to your phone or Tablet with rear camera, the App then produces a complete report that can be printed or emailed to your customer. I forgot to mention you first scan the barcode on the battery being tested, this gives the system details about the battery and compares the finding with the battery specs. If the bar code is missing from the battery you can manually enter the details like CCA and battery size code. The color report shows all you need to help your customer understand if a battery needs to be replaced or how much life can be expected. Made by Bosch this OTC tool is made to give many years of service, it will pay for itself if you sell batteries saving your customers from finding one cold morning the car won't start because they didn't have the information that would have warned them the battery was on its last legs. This tester uses a 9 volt battery, one is supplied with this tester and easy to install. I've added photos, one is part of a Battery report printed from the App, the other is a screen shot from the tester itself. I'll update this review as I learn more about this great little tester.

The light has worked great for the past several months. I did seal it based on advice from others. I highly recommend this light bar.

It says not for exterior use but I'll push my luck. They're brighter than regular halogen bulbs and they actually turn on slightly faster than all of my other halogen exterior lighting. Not an issue just something I happened to notice with LEDs and halogens. Hard to catch if you blink

If you're looking to upgrade that boring old yellowish halogen light color this bulb will do the trick. Not too blue and not too white.  It's just perfect. As far as more light output being brighter  that I can't say is true. It's the same wattage, 65w as the factory bulb. Maybe the color gives it a brighter appearance over the stock one..

Worth buying for sure if you have knowledge of basic tools. It's a bit time consuming to install because you have to cut the existing exhaust and grind down the weld. If you don't have the proper tools it will be much more difficult. But if your willing to put in a little bit of work it's defiantly worth it. The sound is excellent and you have 2 different options for the sound with the DB killer included. The bike has a little more torque(not that the fz09 needs any more torque) save yourself some money and buy this exhaust!! I'm not paid or rewarded in any way for this just a happy customer.

Perfect for my 2000 VW Jetta (2.0L).  Purchased the Mann as a replacement on the Fram filter.  The build quality on the Mann filter is pretty impressive and I will purchase again.

These are by far the best looking of any aftermarket fender flares for the XJ Jeep Cherokee.They do require that you trim some metal away from the wheel well opening.  This requires some finesse that is best achieved using a metal cutting blade on a Dremel tool.  Though it is slower that power shears or a larger 4-5" cut-off blade, it allows for precise trimming.  It also does not bend or crimp the sheet metal like the shears do.The installation goes best when the wheels are off of the vehicle, as it allows you to work with additional space behind the fender panel.  In order to use the factory fender well liner, you'll have to do some trimming and create some holes for the retainer snaps.These will work on the newer year XJ Cherokees, but you'll have to remove or modify the rear bumper end caps (trim pieces).  This wasn't an issue with me, as I already have an aftermarket bumper and removed those a long time ago.The rear wheel wells require that you trim VERY CAREFULLY, so as to not cut through some spotwelds that are precariously close to the trailing edge of the rear passenger's door.  This is a job best left to someone who is skilled at this kind of work - mess up here and you are in trouble.DURABILITY:Use "Back to Black" regularly and these will maintain their "like new" appearance for ages.Bushwacker changed the formulation of the plastic on these a few years ago, so that they are a lot more flexible.  The earlier generations were so stiff that they'd crack from the slightest impact.BUSHWACKER STILL WILL NOT WARRANTY THESE AGAINST BREAKAGE DUE TO AN IMPACT OR COLLISION.They are a lot better that the earlier generation of fender flares.

I own two of these, one on a 2007 Escape XLT V6 and one on a 2012 Escape Limited V6.  It's simply the best looking 2" hitch I've seen on an Escape; mostly due to the tubular design and it tucks up under the car the best you could reasonably expect it to.The reason I dinged the star rating is due to two things (neither would prevent me from buying a 3rd unit).1) Both hitches arrived with scuffs which required me to touch-up paint multiple spots.  I get it, shipping a trailer hitch is awkward, but the packing could be better.2) Both hitches didn't fit great on the passenger side, two rear-most bolts.  The main bracket on both hitches was not angled correctly relative to the frame rail.  I'm sure most installers simply crank on the bolts until they pull the frame rail in to the hitch, but the gap was too much for me to assume the frame rail wouldn't tear.  To remedy the problem on both hitches, I filled the gap with large washers then tightened the bolts as normal.Bottom line, I wish the packing was better, I wish the bracket on the hitch fit the passenger side frame rail better, but I would buy a 3rdCURT 13650 hitch if I has to install another on an Escape.

Unfortunately this product did not work well, if at all. I needed the 15/16 in. extractor to remove a set of wheel locks. I followed the instructions and used a breaker bar to get the bit seated on the head of the nut but it just wouldn't bite into it. The inside 'teeth' of the bit just sheared off like cheap pot-steel. I ended up having to take the vehicle to a wheel & tire shop to get the locks busted off for an additional charge. Lost hours, plus lost additional money = not a worth product. It's almost like this is made for SOFT metals like aluminum, brass, copper, stainless - not hardened steel or chrome like you would have for lug nuts/bolts. If that's the case, update the product details to reflect that. This probably would have worked fine on soft aluminum lugs.

I bought these for a JKU Jeep Rubicon. Even though amazon said it wouldnt fit the optional 60/49 and 50/50 zipper allowed it to fit.It isn't all that snug due to the size of the seat it is suppose to cover but with a few tweaks was able to make it work. Basically you have to pull tight and wrap a few times around the seat legs to make it tighter. Sadly i don't have removable headrests so this sits awkwardly on the rear bench headrests. But you can really only tell from the back.This fits my needs. $35 vs $300 for custom seats made for the Jeep; these are perfect! I like to spend less so that i can change every so often.

Put these on a trailer that had worn tires on the inside.  I'll update after a year or so and let you know how these wear.  I'll be taking the boat to Florida (about a 5hr drive) so it should show if these are cheap or not.  Stay tuned!  Other than that, they took air well, and couldn't be delivery.

This grill was installed on a 2014 Jeep Wrangler.  It is made of a very solid stainless steal material and looks great before and after installation.  The paint appears to be great quality and should hold up well.  If you are looking for something to protect your radiator from large rocks or other road debris, this is it.  The mesh pattern isn't super tight to stop everything, but any debris that has a possibility to damage any engine components will be stopped.  Installation, is pretty straight forward, which includes some drilling of the jeep's plastic grill.  This is where it gets 4 stars instead of 5.  The concept of using the metal tabs on the mesh to mount it to the grill is great, but the manufacturer should place them better.  The mesh mounts fine to the grill but once you go to put the jeep's grill back on the jeep, the mesh starts to interfere with certain components of the front end of the jeep. I had to notch out part of the mesh with side cutters to make room for the temperature sensor, and had to cut down the bolts that are provided, for they are too long and prevent the grill from going back on exactly the same way it came off.  When it was all said and done, I had to trim some plastic off the radiator mount by the hood latch and putting the plastic rivets back in to their proper places was slightly difficult because it took some physical force to make the holes line up.  It all goes back together, it just takes more persuasion than just putting an unaltered grill back on.  It works great though and has been holding up.  I'm confident it will last the life of the vehicle.  It was also pretty painless to notch out a hole for my hood lock.  Other than install, it's a great product!

I was amazed at how much these things weighed when they arrived, they are definitely made of solid metal  and built to last a lifetime! I tested all three and got the exact same pressure reading on all of them. They fit around the valve stem with ease and made a perfect seal every time and you can easily lower pressure with machined tab on the backside of the gage. As a plus, these are proudly made in the USA!

It is easy to use, portable, has numerous patterns and does excellent in terms of bright ness and effectiveness. Excellent alternative to those not wanting to hard wire or modify a vehicle through permanent mounting.As with all my reviews, I will continue to update this review should this light develop issues with ongoing use.Pros-Nice long cord. The cord is 7 long and has a DC Plug sporting two switches. One is a lighted on and off switch. (Orange-red light when the unit it on.) The second switch is your pattern selector switch.-Is a led design and requires lower power than typical halogen lights. (Unsure how much power is actually consumed as there was no markings found on the light  cord.)-Excellent light coverage as it has 240 leds rated at up to 30,000 hours.-Has two built in magnets to attach the light to your vehicle. (Recommend this only if going slow speeds.) Each magnet is covered by a rubber protector.

Advertised to fit a 10" buffer, but it will barely fit my 10" car buffer, if stretched to the extreme. Even then, it doesn't completely surround the sides of the foam buffing pad that is part of my machine. Since it is likely to fit a smaller buffer, I'll have to wait to see if it fits a 6" buffer that I ordered, I'll wait to try that (when it arrives) before deciding whether to return this product. Also, the material looks to be low quality, so not sure how well it will hold up even after just a few uses. The product is not expensive, so if it fits it may still be a good short-term solution.

If I could give this product 0 stars I would. These are absolutely horrendous in quality and clearly cut by hand. I ordered two different methods of putting the brembo logo on my calipers, these stickers and a set of Brembo stencils. The stencils are perfect in nature in main logo and all the letters and were probably cut with a laser cutter, these however, are HORRIBLE and clearly cut by hand! I only highlighted a few of the imperfections but there are so many.AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS!

A multi-device battery system that really delivers. ***Portable car battery chargers are becoming common place now from a couple of years ago when only one or two companies were advertising them and even then it was JUST for a car battery.Now, with the recent set of car battery chargers from a lot more sellers comes several more plugs and ports to make the main battery something of a jack of all trades.With the addition of a multi-head cable, you can choose to recharge a device via a micro usb, Apple 16-pin, Apple Lightning or a mini usb.  This means just about every portable device from an iPhone, iPad (past AND current models) as well as Android devices to bluetooth enable peripherals can be charged by this battery.The included jumper cables is a bit short but that's neither here nor there.Additionally, the set comes with different output connectors for those odd devices you may have lying around.The battery itself is a 12000 mAh lithium polymer battery.  This is impressive because, it's been my experience that lithium polymer ("li-poly") batteries have a stronger/faster output and has a longer shelf life than the more commonly available, lithium ion ("li-ion") batteries.The set comes in a nice zippered case and with all of the plugs you can:+ keep in the trunk as an emergency back up battery+ an external battery that you can use regularly to recharge your mobile devices+ take on camping/ outdoor trips+ boating fares (although my guess is there should be a lot of safety precautions in place here)+ as an emergency light/flashlight/ blinker

This is an OEM roof rack for 3rd gen Toyota Tacomas (2016 on up). You'll notice that this part number supersedes the earlier "35130" part number that is (at least at this time) fifty bucks cheaper. This roof rack makes the second time I have installed one on a Tacoma - my current 2017 and my former 2014 with the previous part number, so I do have a perspective on installation for both 2nd and 3rd gens.They appear to be exactly the same. Emphasis on the word "appear" in case there is some minor variation of 1 or 2 millimeters somewhere that I would only catch with scientific instruments that I am not aware of.The instruction manual for this rack and the previous one are the exact same. That's good, because this rack didn't come with instructions from the seller. No big deal - a quick email to them and they fixed me right up with a PDF document. If you are going to order this roof rack I'd order it then immediately email the seller to get the PDF so you'll have it handy when you get your rack. It arrived quickly and was packed well - no shipping damage or missing parts. (pic attached) With the instructions in hand, it's very simple to pull the ditch moldings and get right to work. You'll need a set of plastic trim tools, a razor blade, pliers, dead blow mallet and a 3/8" ratchet with Torx bits. You'll also need a torque wrench capable of being set to inch pounds - that's not really a problem if you are near a freight company at the harbor - they are 10 bucks with a coupon and they work well for what you are doing.While this is not in the instructions I *highly* recommend getting a tube of silicone to apply to the mounting bolts in your roof. The weld nuts are already there so you don't need to drill anything, but since I'm paranoid about water leaks I loaded up each bolt hole and bolt with large globs of silicone to ensure that I'd never deal with an unintentional water fountain from my truck's roof. The silicone is cheap at your local orange home improvement store and well worth the peace of mind it will give you.My next recommendation is very serious - GET GOOD TORX BITS. Don't settle for the cheap ones, they will strip out the soft mounting bolts and you'll be stuck, since that's the only hardware you'll be able to locate to secure your roof rack.One more recommendation: Be sure that you check the clearance of the front mounting yellow plastic push pin before you push the front part of the rack down on the mounting bracket. (see pic) Get it wrong and you'll have a gap in the front of your rack that's a bear to fix! (ask me how I know...) Also, once you are happy with the mounting position, cover the front of your rack with a towel or something then whack it good with the dead blow mallet. Your rack will then be mounted securely to the front of your truck and not exhibit annoying gaps.The weight limit of this rack is 100 lbs. To me it does what I want it to do (carry a kayak) and makes my Tacoma look more aggressive. I love it and you will too!

Absolutely great for the money.  Fits my 2016 2500 perfectly, even though Amazon said it wouldn't.  You get what you pay for and these are far from the best on the market but for 1/3 the price, I won't complain too much when they start rusting.  Super easy installation once I figured out the front passenger bracket (might as well throw the directions out after looking at the pics).  Expectedly cheap hardware, so don't over-tighten but it's great that they give you different nuts/washers/bolts for different models hole configurations.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone who doesn't want to spend $600-900 on steps.

This assortment of square belts were perfect for a couple cassette players I wanted to repair.  The sizes ranged from 1.5" diameter to roughly 4.5" diameters.  I was able to repair 2 different players so far and I still have a 3rd to get to.  One was a Panasonic Walkman RQ-J7, another was a RCA cassette player with speaker, and the last is a home Sony Stereo with cassette & CD that I haven't gotten to yet.  They seem to be good quality like the originals that came out.  I remember using rubber bands 20yrs ago but they don't last long due to dry rot.The seller I used was "Tokyo_J_Collections". I feel it's important to list the sellers used because I've seen where some have sold knockoffs or lesser quality.  I hope to weed this out.  I hope I helped your decision making.

I will give better stars once I try them out if they work good or better than OEM.But had to drill out the pegs main bolt hole. It was to small. And like others said had to drill out for the spring on one peg.Also, if you plan on buying and having to drill, better have good drill bits and drill press. I have ok grade (not cheap but not good) I wrecked 4 bits drilling threw this heavy hard cast!Heavy? Yes! One new peg weighs more than both OEM steel pegs by far!Plus the extra width is added to front of the peg, not even like one would think.Most of all the points are rounded. I have my doubts that these will give better grip bs the OEM because as you can see in pic the OEM are more pointed to grab boots better.

I purchased these to replace the 20x8-8 Turf Saver OE tires that were on my riding mower.  I was unable to get up small hills and frequently would spin one tire while making turns.  Within one year I had to plug 4 punctures in the sidewalls of the OE tires.Installation was easy with 2 steel tire levers and inflation was also quite easy with a ratchet strap and a bike pump.  I noticed that one tire shipped with a gouge near the bead, and the metal cord was visible if I peeled it back, but it still mounted up without trouble.  If I have issues down the road with this, I'll update here.As far as performance, I'm excited to mow the yard again.  Hills are no trouble and slippage is no longer an issue.  Tight turns tend to rough up the grass slightly, but it always looks good enough for me.  My yard isn't a showstopper anyway, it's better that the mower can get 100% coverage across the lot now.  The sidewalls are definitely tougher than the "Turd Surfers" as well. Overall I'm very satisfied with this set of tires.

Mounted in truck and jeep bumper. Easy job. I used angle grinder. Cut was easy. I think a jigsaw would have done a better job for clean look; but the lights cover my cut marks.  Wired truck to reverse lights. Work great. Wired jeep with a wire kit so thy are on a toggle for off road and I can use to backup. Lights are very bright. I used spot not fog version. I'm very happy with these lights.

Took me about an hour to install. This leveling kit made my truck look so much better! All tools are pretty straight forward, need a 1 1/16 and a large crescent wrench to get the bottom strut bolt out. Make sure you have a good pry bar as well. If you need help turn to YouTube as it is much more useful than the instructions. Great product, very pleased. Must have an alignment after installing. It will drive fine but you will eat tires fast!

Ok, someone had a great idea with this and ran with it.  Yes my 1978 Trans-Am had the large Firebird on the hood and yes it was very cool for it's time...Well some of us feel the Firebird by right should be somewhere on the car; and this reflective sticker that comes in several different colors, and is very reasonably priced....  >>> is the answer..Very easy to install and it really adds to your cars prestige....  Please Make sure the area is clean from all dirt and debris before adding the sticker.  Take your time and it will turn out really nice...Hope this review is helpful in making your final decision.

Freshly applied, this stuff is close to what I've been looking for. While I was in Japan, I used Soft99 Matte Tire Wax. It was amazing stuff that I wish i had stocked up on. It gave an incredible new tire look that lasted for months.This stuff gave a slightly less than glossy appearance on a fresh application. I found the application a little funny because my tires now smell like "new car scent." I'll update this in a while with how it's lasted, but the car doesn't get driven daily.

If you buy these I highly recommend you do research first and see what all is involved in changing your forks. This is a great product but the spacer that you have to put In is made of PVC pipe that you will have to cut yourself. Then you will have to figure out how much for oil you will need to add. Also I recommend contacting progressive to see the amount of fluid you need prior to installation. I did a 1 inch drop and I wouldn't recommend going any lower than that as you may run into complications and hit your fender from bottoming out. Always rip make sure you have 3 1/2 inchof travel in between the top of your triple trees and your fender

First and foremost I like the but guard and it fits great on my 2013 Ram 1500. Was a little surprised on how it was shaped and didn't realize it had some awkward open areas. I have added some pictures so it doesn't catch someone else off guard. Again I'm happy and it's quality but the shape against the body line was unexpected.

This is an acceptable fit for a 2011 Honda Fit base model. One has to either roll/fold one side or have the center dip down behind the mirror. While it covers the small side windows, this does not cover the plastic that is below the level of the dash, which has no protection. Trying to roll it up to use the Velcro to secure it is difficult but not impossible. A better approach is to get 4 bungee cords and make a sort of cargo net across the ceiling with the 4 handles over the doors - Two straight across and two forming an X. Then just roll it small enough to not cover the ceiling light and slide it above the bungees. There it is easily accessible, out of the way, easily slid back to the windshield, and protected from getting smashed/mangled/damaged.I have also ordered a dash cover and want to see if it will cover those places on the side. I do not expect the dash cover to go down that far since there are vents for each of the small windows down there. The initial approach is to place small hand towels in each area to protect the plastic. Additionally, I can pull the towels out when I need to for the vents to operate or if I spill something.

Easy install, nice to have some mounting options without having to mount a big box that will bump your knees. Don't forget to get an auto reset breaker and some wire for the power. Took maybe 45 minutes to finish with most of that time being used to pull wires through the firewall. On my 07 Grand Cherokee the brake signal wire was white with a tan stripe.

6 weeks and 940 miles ago installed this product with the products listed below in my 95 Jeep cherokee XJ 4.0 and it runs so much cooler with no leaks or any other problems. Before it ran around 210 and would start to over heat during extended stops. Now average temp is 165-170 and never heats up above that.. Installation was smooth and easy, everything fit perfectly only downfall i wish it came with new core support mounts otherwise, I'm completely satified.

The Extreme Max tow strap is specialized for heavy duty snowmobile and ATV use. It's an effective tow tool for emergencies and utility use that can be stored compactly.It comes in a cardboard box with clear instructions for proper use. (see attached image of box and strap in box)The construction is first rate with heavy duty stitching (see attached images) on the loops and hardware attachments contribute to a sense of quality manufacturing. The metal hook and eyes are consistent with the intended use and are of quality construction. The hooks are constricted so they may be operated with gloves or mittens (see images).This isn't all. This specialized strap isn't limited to snowmobile or atv towing. The inch wide nylon strapping can be used to lash down bundles or other purposes limited only to the imagination. Since it is strapping tying a knot in it will likely be more difficult than with rope of the same strength.All that said about 20ft of half inch nylon rope may be more versatile, lightweight and compact to store. It would not work as easily for towing as knots would need be tied (and require removing of gloves/mittens), but with limited storage on a snowmobile this may be a consideration. I took some pictures (attached) with the strap on a snowmobile illustrating some of the feature points.No question this Extreme Max Tow Strap is very well made and heavy duty. It's well suited for its purpose. A length of nylon rope might be a more versatile for general use including towing with very limited storage space, but may require removal of gloves to knot.Because it is very well made for its dedicated purpose and it will perform very well I'm giving this 5 stars.

Purchased on 05 Jul 15, dead on arrival and would not take a charge from my UPS or a stand alone Ultima 12V charger.  20+ plus year Navy Electronics Tech so I know a little on the subject.  This is what you really need to know about this battery.  "The battery you purchased, the CSB HC1221W, is covered by a one year manufacturer's warranty against defects in materials and workmanship in manufacturing.  The battery is not guarantied to work for one year, it is warrantied to be free of manufacturing defects for one year."REALLY...."We can accept a return on a test and advise basis. We will test the battery when received and determine if the battery has a manufacturing defect that would be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. The cost of shipping the battery to us is the responsibility of the customer."So I should waste another $6.00 sending back a battery that arrived nonfunctional.  Don't think so.  I will eat the cost as I don't want to deal with this type of "warranty".

Does the job, needed this to finish to attach my heated seats and my dash camera. Its made out of very strong material so I know this thing won't break any time soon. Just a  key thing to remeber like any other 12 volt adapters you really have to squeeze to get the power to go through. I ended up just taping all of mine as you can see the in the pictures.

I installed this on a 2004 Ford F150 STX 4X4,  It Looks Cool, but the installation instructions suck, if you're not an idiot you can figure it out, use the stock tow hook bolts and mount the brackets that way, the rest in easy. Also added some smoked headlights. It looks way better than it did. Buy it.

I have evaluated several Safego products in the last week, and have been generally impressed with their product descriptions, and (mostly) honest wattage/lumens claims. This LED headlight is another fine product and specs seem to align.The 72W is slightly misleading, because that's per pair. They are only listed as 36W each. I tested them with a SLA battery at ~12.5V, along with  current and voltage meters. Upon powering them up, I thought, hey these are the real deal.. super bright! Glancing at the meters, I observed 2.8A at 12V, so they are drawing ~33.6 Watts each, which is close to their specified 36W. Granted, the electronics and built-in fan consume some power, so actual power to the LEDs is probably closer to 30W. Still, for all the Amazon LED vendors, Safego gets an A for honesty.Why 9005 bulbs? Why LEDs?  I bought these to replace the high beam bulbs in one of my cars. I already have 9006 Low beam HID kits (Older BMW with projectors), and while I can buy 9005 HID kits, they are impractical for high beams because you have to turn them on/off so often and HIDs start off dim and get brighter.. These LEDS are full brightness, instantly, and won't vary with temperature.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. I am usually pretty hard on electronics vendors that don't meet specs, but Safego delivered again!

This fit perfectly on the 2012 Jeep Wrangler. I verified with the manufacturer just to be certain.  Seems well made, really the only criticism I could make is that the instructions are a little vague in a couple of spots. But this is very easy to install, and took under 1 hour start to finish for everything.  I recommend removing the bumper before you start, as this is MUCH easier to install without the stock plastic bumper in the way.  There are only 6 bolts holding the bumper on, and since it's plastic, it removes easily.  You'll save yourself a lot of time by taking the bumper off first.  The included hardware is heavy duty, and seems almost overkill considering the maximum trailer load on these is 2,000/3,500 pounds depending on model.  The instructions describe removing the factory tow hook first. Note that this refers to the center mounted tow hook. My model has a tow hook on the drivers side, which does NOT need to be removed for this to be installed.  The wiring harness fit perfectly and is nicely designed to keep the harness up and out of the way.  Make sure you snap in every white plastic anchor on the harness - each and every one lines up perfectly with the factory mounting points.  Make sure the one behind the tail light snaps into the assembly. I took the tail light all the way and sat it out of the way and then spent several minutes looking for where to mount the harness only to realize it mounts to the light itself.Good product, and far cheaper than the OEM component.

ACDelco 45G0002 Professional Front Suspension installed on my 2007 Chevy Tahoe when the original sway bar end link bushings disintegrated. I started hearing a "clunk" sound when turning into a driveway of uneven surfaces. They are easy to install. I did have to use the floor jack to manipulate the bar a bit to get the links installed, when the vehicle is up on jack stands and the wheel is removed .

I love these. Picked up 2 for my Body Armor bumper and tire carrier system. Fits great. But I did use a stainless steel bolt to make it more theft proof.Update:  Well its been 6 months or one DC winter and the paint has faded to pink with white areas showing on both of the two cans I bought.  I used a color matched spray paint to being them back to a factory look.  That was $70.  If they are going to be in the bed of a pickup it would not matter.  And maybe it should not matter with them being on the back of a Jeep.  But it does to me.

Looks great in my 2015 Honda Fit LX! Makes the throws easier since the weight takes car of most of the work. I push it in the direction of the next gear and it pops right in. I love being able to palm it or wrap my hand around it.More of a gunmetal color than black to me.Does react to temperatures. My hand has been quite hot some days. I put an eyeglass bag over it when I park to help a little. I need to find a lighter colored one to hopefully bounce more heat away. If you live somewhere cold it will likely be very cold when you first use it so I'm guessing gloves would be necessary.

I give to this device a solid 5 stars. I am also afraid to be stuck with a dead battery. It happened to me once, I was alone, the phone was dead and I had to use a very expensive service just to receive a jump start.This device is great because it is a real emergency kit. It has just the right amount of V for a jump start. I also want to focus on the fact that this is a way better method for a jump start versus a car to car jump start. In fact, there is no risk of electric shock.The kit comes with a nice case and clear instructions. I will include an update in relation to how long the device can hold the charge.The 2 USB ports are also extremely useful in case of emergency, camping etc. for charging tablets and phones.The LED light is very useful and it has three option:Steady lightFlashingFast Flashing for alert and maximum visibility in the dark.This kit is now a MUST have for me. I am a AAA member but this item is so versatile that I really loved the fact I have it.be sure to check the charge % every 2 or 3 weeks and you are ready to go.I received the car Jump Starter at a discounted price in exchange of an honest review.

I'm not sure if there's different varieties of these black plates being sold, but mine was somewhat different than in the product picture (see the customer photos I've uploaded with closeups).The black metal plate has a slight orange peel texture rather than a clear flat black paint job.  The volt lettering was filled with a silver semi-reflective material rather than white lettering that appears on the product photo.Still even with those differences its still a perfectly good plate and I'll be more than happy to slap it on the rear of my black Volt.

Good so far. I do not understand why the cord from the charger to the car is so much heavier gauge than the cord from the wall to the charger. Gets warmer than the stock L1 unit that came with the car, so I think it draws more current at idle. Build quality is very good, status LEDs much more visible than Clipper Creek. Would give it 5 stars if the cord were a bit longer and there were mounting holes in the case so it could be wall-mounted. I have mine hanging from cable ties.Edit 161017: so far, so good. Unit has worked reliably.

So far so good, installed two hours ago. Hardest part was getting the old one out (stuck shaft). All the wires colors matched the old motor. Also comes with bracket already installed so you can cut the old motors bracket off if you are having issues removing the shaft from the squirrel cage. The wire for the capacitor had a black mark on the end, not sure if they were trying to say that it was a negative wire or what. On the old motor there was no negative or positive markings where you plug into capacitor. I don't think that wire placement matters on the capacitor, but I am not a tech. Overall I am impressed with the motor. It blows just as good if not better than my old one. I also had an issue with the air not getting cold after I installed it. A disconnect/reconnect of the breaker for the outside compressor did the trick. This took me about 4 hours to install with no experience. 2 of those hours were spent trying to get the motor out. I also removed the circuit board when I took this out for fear of damaging it. The old clips should fit right back into place as long as you remove them carefully. I also "set" the set screw twice on the shaft per a HVAC tech's instructions. Also, the shaft seems to be a different size than the OEM motor. In other words I couldn't push the motor all the way in. I has to pull the squirrel cage out onto he shaft about an inch to get the squirrel cage to sit in the middle. Hope this helps the next person, sure would have helped me. The furnace I installed this blower on was a GMS80904BNBD according to the sticker inside the furnace. But it seems like every time I searched that model number, google wanted to change it to something like GMS80904BNBA. So just to set the record straight, I installed this on a Goodman GMS80904BNBD. If you can change an alternator on a car you can do this!UPDATE: it has been almost a year since I installed this and it still works great!

We're all looking for that "just right" bag this is it ! Not too big not too small, Easy on/off, top quality material- rugged and stylish. Every feature extremely well thought out,room enough for the conveyance store stop(two 2 liter sodas and the family size chips or the weekend layover- 2pants2socks2Ts, 2breifs+all the bathroom stuff  and more will fit.A separate extra bag is included designed to clip on top of the outside of the main bag - a backpack strap is tucked into the outter sleeve bottom of the bag - a rain cover has its own pocket zip on out side for quick easy access(also it's sewn in like a hoody inside a zip pocket)  secondary zippers release the pop up expandability feature for longer trips or more groceries.Carrying handle, zippered pockets inside bag + pen and Sunglass holder - and the whole thing is very light weight - whether just a change of gloves or stuffed for the weekend this is it. Also has anti scratch  features for the strap hooks - wow really wow this company thought of everything on this bag.UPDATE - 10_23_2017I recently (10_23/17) replaced my first bag (Fastraxx) from the zipper separating. Dowco replaced it under the warrantee. The same Co That makes excellent products also has a customer service department that exceeds most billion dollar corpert Co's.Wow! A 10$ fee + you ship your warrenteed product and about 5 days later there's your new one delivered by fedex.But wait (?) it looks the same, but, nooo this has been upgraded, it's even better now, and I already gave it 5 out of 5 stars the last time.Whats even better now: Side walls are stronger/stiffer for much better form retention (holds shape).the old double zipper for expansion has become a single, one stronger zipper,the elastic cord with pressure clamp wrapped around the top is much thicker/more heavy duty.And, all the extra stuff that came with it last time is still included.Rain zippered pocket with attached pull-out cover,additional soft bag for more stuff attaches to top of main bagMore verity of straps then you'll need + soft covers for long straps to not scratch your bikeShoulder backpack strap built-in to bag.And, the retail price stayed the same - awesome  Dowco you killed it, this Fastrax is really Nice

This is a simple product.  The price and delivery were great.  Installation was a breeze, just take out the screws, place the cutout, then replace the screws.  I get so many compliments and people asking me where I got them.  I've had them for a couple months.  I'm curious to see how well they hold up after several trips through the car wash.  So far they've been great.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.

Don't neglect these - mine are filthy every time I replace.  As others have stated, simple to remove and install, just careful to not scrunch the 2nd one on install. Dealer cost for this is around $70+,  bought last ones at Lordco for $30, now these for half that - will definitely buy these again.

These neon valve caps add just a little bit more class to the car.As you can see from the pics, when the light hits the valve cap just right, the colors give off a color cast to part of the wheel. Of course the wheels have to be chromed, polished or highly reflective.The cap itself weighs in at .10oz, which in my case is the same weight as the valve cap that came with the car (I weighed them both). The cap looks like it's made to high standards. There looks like at the top of the inside of the cap there is a rubber seal to go against the valve stem; might help you get home if you had a leaking valve core.All-in-all, not a lot to say about a valve cap. Just a little more dressing for the pretty wheels. :-){Sample provided for review}

***updated review***USE THIS PUMP  Sierra Tools Battery-Operated Liquid Transfer Pump, Model# JB5684  works so well no hassles using the spout which is a pain, due to lifting the can with gas its very heavy and if you drop it..Once you fingure out how ti use the spout which is basically make sure to use the unleaded attachment and twist to vent it there is an arrow on it if it's vented pours reasonably well.. Only weak spot is the the attachment for the 50 state carb EPA regs. And that's not the manufacturer's fault it's the law. Make sure you use the unleaded attachment with the spout it doesn't have instructions just put it on the spout and insert into your fuel tank and it works like a charm. I didn't do that 1st time and the tip from the spout came loose and I thought it went into my tank turned out it didn't and it wouldn't. Just put the unleaded adapter on and it works perfectly no spills. Just keep in mind that it's 5 gallons and it's a fairly heavy lift I am able to do it but if you aren't just use a siphon.

This bag is 1/2 the price of the H-D branded bag that served the same purpose. The Nelson-Rigg bag is extremely well made and mounts in seconds. The internal construction of the bag is very stiff - likely some kind of plastic - so it holds its shape even when empty. It is very secure and does not move at all when on the tour-pack. My only complaint is the look of it. It is taller than the H-D bag and, in my opinion, looks just a little bit out of place on the rack compared to the H-D bag that seems to flow with the lines of the bike better.  Yeh, it's a minor thing and for the price point there is just no way I could justify the H-D luggage.On long trips I load all my clothes in this bag and keep heavier things in the saddlebags. I keep my jacket(s) and chaps in the tour-pack. At the hotel I simply lock the saddlebags and tour-pack, unstrap this bag and head into the room with one bag. It has a carrying handle on the back and also comes with a shoulder strap.Overall, this a great piece of motorcycle luggage from a reputable and well-known brand, with an excellent warranty. Highly recommend!

These lights are very nice. I have hid kensun in my buick lacrosse but I decided to give this brand a shot because they were a bit cheaper. They hooked up very easily in my 2003 Chevrolet blazer. The only thing that was confusing was the housing on the hid had a clip on both sides that plugs in to the factory plug. So pay attention to which is the positive and negative on your factory and then plug in correctly. I bought the 10000k lights (deep blue) it's the perfect blue and not to dark.  This brand I haven't heard of but major props to them because they look really good. I have a brush guard on my blazer and it looks really nice through it.

Add the reliability of LED and the intensity, these bulbs breathed life into the incandescent warm yellow hue that was my interior.The grey and black upholstery seemed muted by comparison. Such a simple upgrade revitalized my aging, but still new 2006 G35.The pack of four was enough to replace my overhead dome and rear courtesy lights in my sedan. Ensure you check polarity as others have stated.

Worked perfectly on our 2015 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring!The first hitch that was sent out came in a HUGE box with only a little paper around it, so it was all scratched up down to the metal (I'm guessing it was a return to start with). So I called and Amazon is always great...sent out another one...and the 2nd one was PERFECT. Came in an actual CURT original box that was packed perfectly. All the stickers were perfectly straight. VERY PLEASED!Anyway, the Hybrid Accords have extra "aerodynamic / plastic shielding" that needs to be removed and then trimmed in certain areas. Plus, if a person also has the Mud/Splash Guards (like I did)...it is easier to simply remove the driver's side rear Mud/Splash Guard completely, as there is another Push Pin for the shielding under that Mud/Splash Guard. I've also attached the photos with the exact dimensions that I cut into that "shield" and it came out PERFECT...could not be more pleased...works great with the Thule 9032 EasyFold Carrier, too...also ordered from Amazon last fall.2/1/2017 Pictures AddedAs requested by David...here are photo of the finished product. Also, I'd added a CURT Plug that I also got on Amazon.com (and the car was pretty dirty as we just had several weeks of snow and ice)...enjoy!

Tires tread design looks nothing like the ones I orderedon Amazon which was the reason I chose this tire to begain with. Plus description of tires said ST 205/75R 15 107L . The ones I received say on the sidewalls ST 205/75R 15 -107/102L, 102L which are close to three hundred pounds less then the 107L advertised. And too top it off both tires have one of there sidewall puffed out like they are inflated on the wheels, one of the tires much more so then the other.  A side view of one of the tires looks like the tread dips where the side wall puffs out. I worked for many years with new tires and have never seen this on any new tires not installed on wheels which has me thinking these are blems, which Tire Kings quality control " LOL" failed to notice.  Forty bucks to install is not a good deal to find out these tires are blems, Thanks but no thanks! Will be returning them both!Up Date.I returned both tires for suspected flaws in the manufacturing process and was real hopeful and expecting to get the tires that were and still are shown in the add on Amazon. But all I received was the same tires as the first time only with out the bloated sides effect. If it was not for the fact that I use my trailer for work and that both tires on my trailer were showing signs of separations going on I would have returned both tires and upgraded to better tires. Anyway to be fair I have put a few thousand miles on these tires so far. Plus have had them at numerous times both close to the ninty MPH mark for more than thirty minutes at a time which there only rated for seventy MPH they have performed real well.

Properly set, in order to avoid misshaps, you can operate the throtle without disengaging it and without much force applied. It works as predicted. I'm very pleased with this product and very glad I bought it. Recommend.

This stuff works!  I took an aluminum spinner I found in a box that has been stored for 20 years.  I used a regular shop rag and you can see the results.  Elbow grease?  Yes, I spent about 30 minutes rubbing the spinner and you can see the results.  This is not smoke and  mirrors this is the real deal.  I rely on reviews when I am considering buying a product and I am careful not to "over do it" but I am telling you the spinner shines like new money.  It is NOT chrome, it is very old aluminum model aircraft engine spinner that looks like new with only about 30 minutes of time.  See photos and you will see.  Amazing stuff and I will definitely buy more.  I purchased the small tube because I did not know if it would work or not.  If you have things that need to be renewed buy the big size.  I am buying it now.

I read the reviews and decided to buy these flares for my 1998 Ram 1500. They came quickly and were packaged just fine. They were easy to install, except that I had to take each wheel off because I couldn't fit my drill under the wheel well to screw in the self-tapping screws. I did find that they were not a perfect fit...very close but not perfect. I have some 1-inch gaps under the fender (see pic #3). It is not very noticeable but I am still happy with the look of this product. I had to cut a small part out on both of the rear flares to make room for the black trim piece in front of the wheel (like another poster said he had done). It wasn't difficult but that and the fitting prevented a 5-star rating. Overall, I am happy with them. They are priced right and I wasn't willing to fork over $500+ for a set of flares.

After getting pulled over numerous times for having a headlight out, It was finally time to get rid of that inconvenience and get some head lights. I just really did not wanna spend more than I had to at the store for a set so I went ahead and jumped on Amazon. I purchased some low beam head lights a long with these high beam lights so that I just replace all the lights at the same time. I don't use my high beams very often but these were not that expensive so I said why not. They came in the mail right on time and came packaged very nicely. Just like something you would see at the store. I went outside, popped my hood open and went to work. In the photo I attached to this review, I am comparing these high beam lights with a Sylvania HB3 bulb that has been in use for about 5 months. The Sylvania bulb is on the right side and this bulb is on the right side. You can see that this bulb is just a tad bit brighter than the older Sylvania bulb. Most likely due to the difference in use. Overall, these high beam bulbs works great. I wouldn't use them as an upgrade from a normal bulb but I would definitely reccomend this for anyone who needs to replace a spent bulb. I was given this product at a discounted rate in return for my honest and unbiased feedback and was never one pressure or forced to write positive only feedback.

UPDATE: The product now comes in plastic bottles!!!!!2.5 years ago, it came in a metal can, but they have since changed it. I also have photos of the new bottle.Wagner Severe Duty is still a good value and remains the cheapest DOT 5.1.--AAC<s>Since non-silicone brake fluid is hygroscopic (absorbs water), and can even absorb moisture through the plastic bottles that most brake fluid comes in (and thus it has a shelf life), the metal can is a very big plus. It was also a pleasant surprise for me, as I was expecting a plastic bottle. (I have also heard that many 5.1's absorb moisture even more quickly than DOT 3 and 4.)</s> no longer applicable, see above.It is also the cheapest DOT 5.1 by quite a big margin. Motul DOT 5.1 costs about as much for a 500 mL bottle (HALF the size of this item!). NAPA DOT 5.1 costs about the same as Motul, and Amazon's free shipping also sweetens the deal. (However, like all fluids, it must be shipped ground due to FAA guidelines)Like all DOT 5.1, it has a dry BP of at least 500 F, and a wet BP of at least 356 F. It also requires a much lower viscosity than DOT 3 or 4 (which is why many premium brake fluids with higher BP's than the 5.1 standard are not DOT 5.1)

I have a 2000 TJ and found out last year when I bought this box (from a different store)it would not fit under the front seat, so I mounted it under the back seat instead.  It is easy to get to and is well hidden.  I liked it so much I just bought another and mounted it under the back seat on the driver side.  The mounting tabs don't line up very well for bolting it down so I welded it to the floor.The box is well made, sturdy and during the last year has held up very well.

Absolutely amazing product!  Best detail spray-like product I've ever used, and the slickness it lays down is wonderful, smells great to boot.  I'm a detailing fanatic and this is now my go to detail/waterless wash/surface mitt lubricant and rinseless wash product all in one.  Let's face it, when you buy a 22oz bottle of waterless wash, or even detail spray, and use it liberal enough not to damage your paint, you will use a LOT of product making single bottles way too expensive.  With Ultima you can feel good about using a lot of it b/c of the cost per gallon, it has no equal out there in my opinion.  Thank you Ultima for making such a great product and keeping the price reasonable, please don't change and you have a customer for life!

SO the metal is great. The rubber has teeth on both sides so it will sink into the bar you are clamping and the mount. What I do not like is that it is supposed to fit on a 1 in bar. I have a Yakima rook rack on my truck. It has a 1 in (confirmed with the company) bar. So I got these. When you tighten the supplied screws down all the way the metal on the clamp meets so it can not clamp down anymore. The mount can move easily. It is not tight. I would think on a 1 1/8 or thicker bar it would be fine. (yes I am using the right rubber for the 1 in.)  Pic shows me pushing it down with ease.  The light bar is only 43in and is light (as in not heavy, I realize it is a light :)

I really don't have any issues with this battery.  If I had to do over, I'd get the yellow top.  The red top does not like to be drained for extended periods without recharge.  I have read a lot of reviews where folks have bashed the red-top.  I think that some of these folks never read the users manual for the red top - IF YOU HAVE HIGH CAPACITY HIGH DEMAND ELECTRONICS, the Yellow Top may be what you want, if you want an Optima battery.  Check the Optima website before buying.Now, regarding Amazon packaging and returns, I have to give Amazon A++ for my case.Update:  An Amazon customer asked for dimensions.  I measured mine at the base (largest there) and have approximately 6 3/4" W x 9" L.  The height is 6 3/4".

I didn't have a trans temp gauge for before and after comparison of temperatures but I can tell by hand that the temps are down a huge amount.

I bought this rear view mirror for a Polaris RZR 1000 XP.The bases are very easy to install (2 bolts each, T25 I believe, perfect size for the OEM roll cage).It provides a wide view, which is just perfect for the RZR.You can move it up or down, depending on how you want to place it, and to adjust the view.Update: 6 months and the mirror has came appart from its base.

Great bumper! Fit perfectly and looks awesome! I purchased this on November 9th 2015 and still love it. As you can see from the pictures I have put this bumper on two jeep TJ's. One was a 99 and the other is a 06. Sadly i totaled my 99 when a car hit my rear corner panel during a snowstorm causing me to fishtail and slam into a concrete barrier at about 60mph. I fully believe if I did not have this bumper i would have been much more hurt after the accident. Due to the bumpers thickness and strength, the frame became the weak point and took the full force of the crash causing the frame to bend beyond repair. Surprisingly the bumper was not badly damaged at all even though it is what contacted the barrier. Once i bought my new to me 2006 jeep TJ wrangler the first thing I did was throw this bumper on it. All I needed was new grade 8 bolts since mine were sheared off in the accident and a rubber mallet to put it on. I did my best to show the damage that was caused by the accident (as seen on the silver jeep) but as you can see, with a little sanding and painting this thing will look brand new!

Worked great on my 2006 Scion XB. But the vendor gives no instructions on how to put this on.Installation isn't really difficult but takes about 2 hours. You'll need to take the outside hatch handle off to get to the switch. To do that, first remove the inside panel cover on the hatch door. You can leave the upper plastic pop rivets in place, as long as you can reach up inside the cover and get to the two nuts that hold the outside handle in place. Remove these nuts with a 10 mm deep socket. Now the outside handle will come off easily. Unscrew the 2 philips screws holding the switch in place. Leave all the wiring in place. There's no need to disconnect anything.Now for the hard part -- scraping off the black sealant that Toyota glopped over everything. I used a putty knife and it took about an hour. Wear rubber gloves. Mineral spirits can be used to cleanup the switch (and your hands if, like me, you were foolish enough to think you'd be careful and wouldn't need gloves).NOTE: this rubber cover slips over the TOP plate of the switch. The switch itself is on the base or bottom plate. It took me a few tries to figure this out. The rubber cover has a lip around it that curls underneath. That lip should be tucked under the top plate so it gets trapped between the two metal plates, making a watertight seal when it's all screwed together. Screw the 2 philips head screws back in place, put the outside handle back on, run the nuts up and tighten them just barely snug. Remember, this is all plastic. Pop the inside panel cover on. Now you're good to go.

I just received these calipers and both are the correct parts but are very different from each other. One looks like a quality re-manufactured part and the other appears to be a lower quality casting and is actually defective. I think one is a re-manufactured OEM part, and the other may be a re-manufactured non-OEM part. Just a guess. The bigger issue is that the silver (left) caliper is unusable. It has a machining burr on its face that will rest against the pad's backing plate and prevent the pad from seating properly inside the caliper. It had to occur during the rebuild as it could not have been used safely like this on a previous vehicle. Also, the large spring clip doesn't stay locked in the mounting hole..it just falls out. The OEM-looking caliper is not painted and the clips mount securely. The bolts appear to be iridescent zinc-plated where the defective part has unplated silver bolts. These were probably sourced from different re-manufacturing suppliers. Only one of these can be used as shipped, so I'm delayed now due to poor quality control. I have sent a message to Callahan and will update once I get a resolution..UPDATE: Callahan was very responsive and sent me a return label and shipped the replacements once I returned the original set. The new set were nearly identical and had the same re-manufacture date and no defects. The tension spring clip still did not stay properly attached to the calipers but I was able to center it and make it stay in place when installed. The factory spring clip attaches so tightly it's difficult to remove. Caliper installed and working well so far. Upping rating to 4 stars.

Just did another oil change and decided to change my air filter as well. Saw this filter and was kinda reluctant because of the price but i figured my car isn't getting any younger so why not soring a little extra for the best. Looks like the filter has a oil on it not to sure how that works but i changed everything and got in the car for a test drive and she did start strong and drive well so im kinda impressed. I see they sell the filter oil amd cleaner so i will prolly pick grab some in a few months.kinda neat that its reusable

Like so many other reviews my experience with this product is disappointing. The end result is nice but the work and customization you do on your own is ridiculous. I'll start with the good: the package arrived on time and undamaged. The finish is great and the lock works well. The Bad: The hardware the door comes with is inadequate in quality and supply. With only three mounting points 2 of which use the rivets you drill out from stock door the unit does not sit flush enough to my liking and can be pried off. The instructions are a joke, they say to watch "You Tube" videos of customers installing THEIR OWN PRODUCT. Not to be rude but some of these videos aren't helpful AT ALL and should never be referred to. Maybe two videos can help but one is not even an FJ so it's not even the same model. I bought better hardware and rotated the longer Allen heads to make better contact. Some of the videos say to drill another hole (STOP)! I would not and did not do that. I modified a bracket the unit came with and now it sits flush and the locking door actually closes and locks easily. If you are not mechanically inclined I would not reccomend this product. I don't pay shops for install I do it on my own.

When I parked my truck this morning, and opened the windows a little, I noticed that the back windows had a larger opening at the rear of the window. Normally, when you vent the windows, the top of the glass is behind the vent, so rain won't come in easily. But, as you can see in the picture, the shade doesn't extend down far enough to cover the top edge of the window at the rear of the opening. If I move the window up so the gap is gone at the rear, there is no gap at the top, so the vent doesn't work.I have used these shades on many of my vehicles, but I have never noticed a gap like this before. They don't work on the rear windows of my truck.This is on a 2012 Dodge Ram Crew Cab pickup

I use a lot of Griot's garage products and like them.  So when I found myself running low on Meguiar's Gold Class Car Wash I decided to buy this Griots's Garage Car Wash.  I am attaching a photo of the bottle I received in this order next to the ruler - the 16 oz bottle is 6 inches tall.Griot's Garage Car Wash generated good suds and worked well.  However, it did not work any better than Meguiar's Gold Class Car Wash or several other car wash concentrates I used in the past.  I did not spend any less time on washing, I still needed to clay&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Griot-s-Garage-Cleaning-Clay/dp/B003POLA84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Griot's Garage Cleaning Clay</a>&nbsp;my car to remove small imperfections. The main difference which may matter to someone that Griot's Garage is totally orderless, where as other car washes I used have a scent.On the negative side Griot's Garage Car Wash is rather pricey.  At the price of $8.99 this works out to 56 cents per oz. Meguiar's Gold Class Car Wash that I bought at a local retailer was $4.43 for 72 oz., 10 cents per oz.  Overall, I satisfied my curiosity and will not be buying it again.Ali Julia review

This was exactly what I was looking for. I bought it to put in the back of my 2009 Jeep Wrangler JK (two-door). I knew when I ordered it that it would be too big, since my Wrangler has a tiny tiny cargo area. But for the price, you can't beat this mat. Custom made cargo mats for wranglers are four times as much as this mat costs. So I knew going in I would need to cut the mat to fit.The mat arrived quickly and was packaged nicely. I unrolled it. It took me all of about 90 seconds to cut the mat to fit in my car. It is not very weighty, but heavy enough that the mat stays down flat on the carpet and grips. I don't have any issues with it moving around or curling. It is not flimsy and has a nice sturdy build although it's not extremely thick. It's been in the Wrangler for about 2 weeks now, and it's just perfect. My carpets are protected, I'm less worried about throwing groceries in the back seat. It is excellent, especially for the price. I see no reason why this floormat won't last me many years!

I used these as part of a complete exhaust replacement, attaching a brand new exhaust header to a brand new downpipe.  The installation was a bit more than trivial.  The long bolts included with this kit are not tapered, so getting them started in the threads of the header is quite a chore.  Add to that cramped working conditions and holding 4 things with 2 hands and you'll have yourself a jolly good time.  Had the bolts been slightly tapered at the end, I suspect that the install would have been far easier.In case the description is not clear, the kit comes with the following:2 Springs2 M10 Washers2 Long M10 Fine Thread Bolts2 SleevesThere are no nuts included with the kit.  On the RAV-4, the exhaust manifold is threaded, so no nuts are needed.

Arrived quickly and properly packed.  Amazing quality for the price.  Install was simple and quick. The top fit fantastic. The upper door skins have different gaskets than the factory which make them fit strange but they are weather tight.  Overall, a great purchase.  Looks very nice.  I use my Jeep hard. In the woods. On the rocks. If the top gets wrecked some day, being wiped on a tree, I will buy another.  At this price, I can buy 3 of these for what most tops cost.

Firstly, I have to agree with people in regards to installation.....don't rush it! Don't start yanking, pulling, tearing things apart, you and your jeep with love you for it. No real installation instructions, just a diagram, so review before starting. Take your time, especially removing the Air Flow sensor.  Mine was a bit difficult, again, don't just grab some pliers and start yanking. I noticed how dry and conceivably brittle the plastic may be, so guess what?... a little lube goes a long way!  I put a small amount of silicone lubricant on the outside housing and worked it around a bit and VOILA, came out no problem.  So, that was the most difficult part of this installation. I would of given this 5 stars but the top cover did not fit that great, the holes were misaligned quite a bit.  Unfortunately with these things, they are made to get produced and out the door fast, so some quality issues will be apparent with almost anything nowadays, sucks.  I little tweaking, I managed to get the cover to fit better but definitely not perfect without drilling out some more holes and making a mess.  I'll live with it .  I also had to cut 1/2" off the pipe due to having a 1/2" throttle body spacer.  There was no way this was going to fit without cutting some off.  In the end, it looks good and I've only driven it a very short distance so far.  Nothing too spectacular but the sound is better and the butt dyno says there is something there.  My wife was in the jeep when I stepped on it and she siad, "Whoa, was that because of that air thingy you put in there!" lol.  So, there you have it.....wife approved!

From the man of the family. Let's tell the truth here. When you add a product like this to your vehicle's cooling system, you are not really going to see it working or know if it does. This is where you have to trust the manufacturer to have done a good job.I'm giving this 5-stars for what it claims to do. We have a 2003 Honda that we baby and want to keep going for a lot of years to come. We live in Arizona where summer temperatures can hit the mid-120s F. You can imagine how terrific the heat is in the engine! The most important factor to keep a vehicle running well is regular maintenance. I change the engine oil every 5,000 miles (no need to do it every 3,000 as your auto shop may want you to as today's engine oils last the 5K). I check the cooling system regularly and top it up with additional coolant when required. Ever two or three years, I flush the system fully myself and add new coolant.So the opportunity to beef up the quality engine coolant I use with this V-12 product just made sense. It's easy to use. The bottle fits your hand. You unscrew the cap, remove the seal, and pour it in. You could add it directly to your radiator of course (make sure the engine is cool before you remove any cap from your cooling system!). However, it's recommended that you simply pour the VR-12 into your cooling system reservoir. Usually, there's "head room" in that reservoir, and this is only 16 oz of fluid, so it should all go in.VR-12 is made from organic chemical components that protect from rusting. It promotes heat transfer, which lowers your engine's operating temperature (although it's too subtle to see on the gauge). It is designed to "re-energize" your antifreeze/coolant. It's good to know that it is compatible with any color of antifreeze, and it is meant for vehicles of any type and age.Recommended.

While traveling we "somehow" accumulated extra stuff for the drive back home so we felt something like this was necessary. As they say you get what you pay for and that is true in this case. The package arrived damaged and when I opened it the item was also damaged. Ideally I would have returned it without a second thought but since we were pressed for time I decided to make it work. I wasn't missing any parts as in other people's items and besides some scratches on the unit, a bent tube where the two halves join together was the biggest issue. Fortunately I was able to hammer it back good enough to assemble it and use it. The base does not join or assemble together in any way so I'm sure that will contribute to it's weakness. It is easy to assemble and it does feel sturdy but I'm not too confident I can load it up to it's full weight limit and not see some bowing or flexing. For the price it is a good deal and since we weren't home I kind of didn't have any other option, at least not paying an arm and a leg for. If it wouldn't have arrived damaged I would have rated it higher and I might change it after our 7 hour drive back home, depending on how it holds up during the trip.

Very bright. Very awesome. Looks great with other LEDs on my car. My favorite aspect of this plate light was the versatility of mounting and 360 swivel. I ended up putting it right underneath the plate bolts, but I don't see why this couldn't be top/bottom mounted onto a bumber or pretty much anywhere youd like. Some may argue that its too bright... but I kind of like the little glow it puts out onto the street in the rear. The metal that its made of is not of the highest caliber, and has slightly oxidized over a couple of months. But for the price, I am very pleased. For somebody looking to fashion some type of plate light / under hood / trunk / truck bed light.. This is for you.

I am always on the lookout for products that solve a problem to make my life easier or save me money.  My husband and I regularly flounder gig at night off our little skiff (boat).  We would love to hop out of the boat and gig on foot but the batteries we use to  run our lights are too heavy to carry for long.  I bought a portable power bank similar to this iCLever one and thought with all the possible attachments there may be some way to hook them up to our lights to use them.  It worked but it just did not have as much power as I wanted.  I saw the  iClever Portable Car Jump Starter, Auto Battery Booster, Power Bank and Phone Charger and thought I'd give it a try since it had 18000mAh.  I ordered one and thanks to Amazon Prime, it only took two days for it to arrive.The iCLever Portable Power Bank is very compact and lightweight.  It comes already charged, but I plugged it in to top off the battery anyways.  I tried using the jump start clamps to hook to the two wires on our gig lights, but it kept timing out.  Nice safety feature for jump starting cars, but not good when you want to run a light!  I next used a different plug adapter that I already had on hand and it worked just fine.  We gigged for two hours and used only a third of the power despite having two high lumen underwater LED lights attached.  This  iCLever  Portable Power Bank was EASY to carryI put it in a little fanny pack and didn't hardly notice it.  Having this for so many possible uses (jump a car, run gig lights, charging a cell phone, etc) makes it a very versatile tool.Flounder season is pretty much done for the year, but I cannot wait until next year to use this again!!!Overall I feel the iCLever Portable Power Bank is a great value.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A lot of thought is put into most of my reviews, and I write them as I personally rely on reviews when I purchase.

These driving lights remind me of those cheap nine-volt lights you get for bicycles... they barely through enough light out there to see where you're going, at best.  That's what the old headlights on my '95 GMC van were starting to look like, and I was hoping these would help illuminate things without the need for my high-beams. I also wanted some cool-looking driving lights on the front of my van.  Unfortunately, I think my old headlights are actually brighter. The two sets of them together are only slightly better than the original headlights alone..Sometimes spending a little more money for a known, trusted brand is a better gamble.  That's what I'll do next time, and maybe I'll hang these off the rear bumper as backup lights.

ATTENTION PEOPLE BUYING FROM GADGET-TOWN, they are advertising the CS800-S system and shipping you the CS801-S system. The 801-S system comes with two 1-button keyfobs. The 800-S system advertised here comes with two 4-button keyfobs. The 1-button keyfobs do have the ability to lock/unlock doors and remote start, but they DO NOT have the ability to pop the trunk. Additionally, I personally feel the single button on the 1-button fobs is too easy to press accidently. I've personally installed probably 40 of the CS800-S systems and know the 4-button fobs very well. The two packages are VERY similar and actually use the same brain, just different keyfobs. I would return it, but it's a Christmas gift and needs to be installed tomorrow.The Compustar system itself is perfect. I've been installing Compustar and Viper systems for many years. Though Viper makes a decent system, I feel they're stagnant as can be and haven't innovated anything useful in ~10 years. They're living off their legacy. Compustar on the other hand, make a system that's so installer friendly and offers several large advantages over Viper. First, changing models of keyfobs or upgrading from 1-way to 2-way keyfobs are easily done with any of their systems. Next, the programmer they use plugs into the antenna cable, versus having to dig at the brain after the install. So much easier. The higher end brain offers a low current start harness if applicable to the vehicle you're installing in. No wrestling with 12awg wires if it's not needed. The higher end brain offers a docking port of the immobilizer bypass module (BLADE) to make for a super clean install. All the wiring is on one side of the brain, again, making for a super clean install. The remote start reservation mode for manual trans vehicles (FT7200 brain) is much more natural than Viper's. Switching from - to + door lock control is easily done. You can add-on an alarm later if you want (FT7200 brain only). The DAS sensor is a beast. etc etc etc The list goes on and on. All advantages of Compustar over Viper. I'm not trying to brand bash. Just informing people reading this that Compustar has their stuff together and has been doing me VERY well for years. Nice price point, dependable, feature rich. Buy it. Just be aware if you're buying from the seller "gadget-town".

I can't express enough how cool this product is. I wanted to get something that would work for the back of my truck as a tent and I didn't think anything would be out there. Boy was I wrong. When browsing around I saw this product which was a tad more expensive then some of the more classic plastic like tents but I couldn't be happier. I haven't had a chance to use this product camping yet but I have set it up quite a few times for practice. Based on my initial tests the product is excellent. It fits really well over the box of the vehicle with the end closest to the cab having a flexible and adjustable end (probably for the numerous box sizes available on trucks), numerous tie downs and straps that allows for the product to stay secured onto the box (including 3 lightweight but durable steel poles for center support) and as far as I can tell is extremely durable and breathable. I would suggest this product to anyone looking for something that stands out as well as an inexpensive way to enjoy camping. When fully erect the tent allows for about 5 ft of clearance on the inside which comfortably allows for moveable room within the tent as well as the ability to place cots, storage, etc within the tent.

This set of lights look and work really well.  They produce a nice white or blueish white light and seem to be brighter than their standard replacement bulbs.  They fit the electrical sockets on my truck perfectly, and also fit nicely into the lamp hosing on my fog lights.  The electrical plug end is almost identical to the original light bulbs, and the other end is marginally shorter than the originals.  Overall, I am happy with these lights and think that they will last a good amount of time on my truck.Disclosure: I have received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review, but that fact has not influenced my opinion about the product. I was not required to write a positive review and no monetary compensation was received for writing reviews.

At 185,000 miles the radiator in my 2001 Accord EX started leaking at the top crimp. Denso being the OEM, I was surprised at how cheap this was. Exact match, fit perfectly and Im back on the road. If you need a radiator, why not go OEM, and cheaper than aftermarket at that!

The lights are great. Using 27 LEDs, they produce 280 lumens light, color temp of 4000-4500k and 2.8 Watts. As others mention, there is a out of box defect rate. Choose 4/5 stars because one of six lights had an inconsistent flicker. Sent defective bulb to Amazon. I really like these and hope they send replacement soon.

These are a must for import vehicles and some domestic vehicles that have the spark plugs in the center of the valve cover, and about 6" deep. Regular spark plug sockets will just get stuck to the spark plug, causing a nightmare trying to remove the socket.This three piece set comes in different lengths, has swivel heads, and the spark plug socket is permanently attached to the extension.I do highly recommend this three piece set!CPS

For starters, this is a well-made product. It is water proof, had a nice-fitting weather plug, and is overall good quality. The pigtail is pretty short, but that wasn't a problem for my application. I installed it on a Taylor-Dunn cart that lives outside, so I wouldn't need to keep slamming an extension cord in the door. The only issue I have with this is that it doesn't fit newer extension cords without a modification. Newer cords have a bump on them that prevents someone from plugging in a 3 prong plug backwards (so the ground pin is hanging out...) In order to use one of these cords, you'll need to clip off the bump. See my photos for a better understanding of what I'm talking about.

Very good product, leaves a nice shine. Both cleaner and wax look like semi thick black paint they are both liquid. I would highly recommend wearing gloves and being careful when applying as they can stain, my orange microfiber towels now look completely black after and I don't think the black stains will entirely come off. The kit comes with 2 bottles of spray detailer to help clean the precleaner and wax off after they dry to a haze, I used 1 and less than half of the other. I did find both precleaned and wax a bit difficult to buff offeven with the detailer spray.  I did this by hand so it is a time consuming process 3+ hours. Comes with 2 small applicators which are good. It is a great kit I like the whole presentation of it "black box" everything inside and out is black. The only thing that would make it better is if they included a black microfiber towel. I would rate the kit 4.6 stars. Leaves a mirror like shine I attached a photo of my cars hood, very reflective .

Great looking D-Rings.  Haven't had a chance to use them yet but they seem very much up to the task.  Will update review after a few outings. I do agree with other reviewers that these are much closer to 1" thickness than to 7/8".  It could be the thick red paint that makes the extra difference, but they just barely fit into my 1" holes (Had to help them in lightly with a mallet).  If you have 7/8" holes these will DEFINITELY NOT fit.

This is a very cool product. It serves as a isolation switch. I bought a 80 amp breaker for my RV/ inverter / solar system. I bought a 40 amp for the solar panels and a 80 amp for the 600 watt inverter, went with this breaker style so I could turn each one off and on easily. Great product. I wish I had found these sooner. Seems we'll build, it's a not blowing so it must work. I used both today when I repositioned my inverter, and turned off the solar because my batteries got to 120 degrees. After I was done and it cooled down I switched the breakers back on.

Got this to replace the VVT Solenoid (also called OCV - Oil Control Valve) on my 1999 Lexus RX300.  Replaced both the original solenoids (Dorman 917-214 & Dorman 917-211).  Look up for instructions at ClubLexus.  Took me about an hour to replace both.  My RX300 works great with no random misfire and with increased MPG.Dorman Part# 917-214 and 917-211 are essentially the same, except for the location of the bolt retainer bracket (front or back bank).

This product works well. It removed street grime and bug smears that were dried on my vehicle's hood. All it took was minimal "elbow grease" and a clean cloth. I have attached three photos. The mostly red picture, taken as the sun was setting, shows dried on insect and tar debris. The other two shots show what it looked like after I had used Star brite Premium RV Guard to clean it up. The color of the photos is different only because the sun was rapidly setting and not directly hitting the hood of my vehicle when I took the last two shots. The only spots left on my vehicle's hood  were actually pre-existing scrapes in the paint which will be there no matter what. This is a good product with a not unpleasant scent that kind of reminds me of grape scent. The spray is not thick but more watery in consistency. It works well though and that's all that matters in my book.

I put this on my 2012 Golf TDI and the fitment is perfect for all 4 windows. This is the only DOT approved vent visor. It has a nice low profile and smooth look. The front deflectors have branding stickers that can easily be removed. It only took me 10 mins to put on all four. Just make sure you muscle them into the window channel nice and tightly. Once in place pull towards you until they fit tight with space for the window to roll up smoothly. Contrary to other reviews found here on amazon this will fit all 2012 model golf's including TDI, GTI, R, and rabbit. Check out my customer pic above for an idea of what to expect.

I haven't had this cover for too terribly long and I usually like to wait a while before writing a review.  Nonetheless, my first impressions are very good and I think this will be a good long term solution for me. The fabric/material seems durable and firmly water resistant.  The elastic along the edges is strong and the restraining loops are perfectly spaced for me.  I've included a picture of this on my 1st generation Suzuki SV650 (2001).  This is a size medium and I don't think it'd stretch out much further length-wise.

This product looked amazing when I first put it on(pictures attached) but It didn't last as the hype for the product did.  I clay bared before application as well.  I later found out from Meguiars that there ultimate wax lasts longer so I guess that is my fault for not doing proper research.  My car sits outside 24/7 which adds to this, but I feel it only lasted about to weeks and the fine, oh so fine swirls were appearing again.  The beading was still great after months! Its a absolutely great product for looks, but for the price and longevity that's why I gave it a 3 star.  I am going to try it again soon and see if I see any differences and I will update if I do either way

I bought this panel to hold me over till I get my feniex 4200 purchased, first off for the price it's not bad.... It does what it's supposed to do. I have the momentarys set up as a in and out switch for my winch. One switch has always been hard to activate, tapped it with a hammer and works better, the biggest issue is if there is power present on any of the "input" lines the back lights will stay on. This is a issue as the power going to the box is constant, hience why you purchase the box to switch items on and off... So this means either the backlight says on all the time or, your have to switch power to the input leads....

Installed very easy.You only need a drill, an oversize drill bit, and the will to punch a quarter size hole in a perfectly good kayak. I was too cheap to buy the proper drill bit. Finish off the hole with a drywall knife. They don't make these kayaks out of carbon fiber. The whole installation process took all of five minutes. Now I can wash the inside of my yak!

This is my true story.Approximately 2 years ago I paid our local lawn and equipment dealership over 100.00 to pick up my John Deere L120 garden tractor to give me a estimate on what it would run to fix my John Deere because it was running extremely ruff. The small engine repair business said I would need a short block and that it would run me approximately $1,000.00 for a new one. After I got my John Deere back home I stored it in my garage for 2 years thinking I had to get a new engine. Until recently I came across the Best Line engine treatment and told myself I have nothing to loose but everything to gain. After watching many YouTube videos on Best Line engine treatment I gave it a go at on my John Deere tractor.I put new 5W-30 synthetic oil in, a new oil filter, gas filter, air filter, spark plugs, fresh premium fuel, and then I added the Best Line Engine Oil additive.To my complete amazement my John Deere L120 Garden Tractor runs smoother then it did when I bought it brand new.How could that be? But it does.All I can tell you is that this product saved me over $1,000.00 and it will be going in all my vehicles and anything that runs on an engine.I would be financially foolish not to.The proof is in the pudding and this product is the real deal and not some marketing gimmick.I highly recommend it to anyone who wants their engines to last a long long time.Hope this helps all readers out.It certainly saved me hundreds of dollars.Well worth the small investment.

Perfect fit for 2008 Honda Odyssey EX-L.RECOMMENDATION: Use an articulating socket adapter attached to your MAGNETIC plug socket.  Getting to the rear drivers side plug is very difficult without it, but absolutely no trouble with that adapter and 4 inch extension (I couldn't find my 4-inch, so assembled others together to make 4 inches).  Be sure to use anti-seize compound on the threads.

Wow! I can't even believe what a difference these AutoEC White 6000k 16SMD 41-42mm Festoon Dome Light Bulbs make. they are so bright! One thing that I notice as I get older is that everything is getting darker. During the day I can see things fine, but when it gets dark, I need a lot more light. Since I've installed these lights, I can now see as if it were daytime. I'm so happy with these lights, I think I'm going to buy more for my wives car. About the only negative thing that I can say about these lights is that, if you look right at them, it hurts your eyes. They're that bright! But as long as you don't look right at them, They are awesome! My original dome lights were a lot shorter in length, about 1" long. These bulbs are about 1 1/2" long, so I had to turn them kind of crooked to fit them in, but they work just fine.  I did receive these at a discount price in exchange for my honest review. I honestly love them and highly recommend to all! I added a couple before and after photos so you can see the difference.

Okay, so it's not a Harley trunk. So what!I pondered the purchase of this for quite some time, and finally pulled the trigger!Sue it has some minor inconsistencies, but overall - I am pleased.Since my Vulcan had a two tone paint job, I decided to find something as close as possible to one of the colors, this way it wasn't all black. So I prepped it out and painted it. It actually came out really good!I've already ad multiple compliments on it. And hey, it's all about the looks and convenience.

Great little Back-Up battery.  Has saved my ass multiple times when my motorcycle battery died.  Recently went on 6 month deployment and upon returning the battery only drained 50%, but still had enough juice to jump.  Recommend charging once every 6 months if you don't use it often.  Flashlight works great,  double tap power button to turn on and off.  When connecting leads to a vehicle battery,  always connect black lead (ground) up first, and when disconnecting leads the black lead should be removed last.  This goes for all jump starting, ground  should always be connected first, and removed last.

ITEM BEING REVIEWED: D-Ring 3/4" Pin.PACKAGING:  The packaging consisted of just a plain plastic bag with zip top that held the tow hook in it.INSTALLATION: The installation process was a snap.  Just took the pin out of the hook and then put it back in.  Easy as pie.USAGE: This tow hook was very easy to install and made a great addition to my 4x4 truck.  With it I was able to pull my buddy out of a mud hole just this weekend.  What great timing with getting this hook.  So far the powder coated surface is holding up and the color blue is still holding up after a bunch of towing.DISCLAIMER:  I did receive this product at a discounted price in order to test and evaluate and provide unbiased feedback to both the seller as well as other Amazon buyers like you.

Preliminary review at this point, but so far, I'm happy.  I'm building a light bar for my hitch mounted bike rack with these.  With 4 bikes on there, the car's lights are hard to see.  I've been worried about it for a long time.  As soon as I get this made, I'll feel a lot better.I bought http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H9JFS2 to attach the lights to, and some appropriate size U bolts to attach to the arms of my bike rack.  I'll load the bike rack, then attach this assembly to the ends of the arms and plug in the wiring.  The lights and the aluminum bar are a good fit for each other.  I bought a trailer wiring extension cord about 8 feet long to do the wiring.  It was cheaper than a whole trailer harness and is long enough for my needs.  I just cut off the end with the single bare lead.The lights sit flush surface mounted.  I'm going to attach them with pop rivets.  You'll either have to have a hole under the lights for the wiring, or Dremel/file an area of the lip of the back for the wires to come out from under the lights.  If you use a hole, also use a grommet or wire loom to prevent chafing and a short.  Solder the wires and use shrink tubing for insulation for best results.  There is plenty of space under the lights to hide these connections for protection from the elements.The wiring is simple, and pretty much follows wire color conventions for trailers with 4 wire flat connectors.White is ground, and most trailers use that color for ground as well.Black is the positive lead for the parking/marker lower brightness lights.  The trailer wire this goes to is most likely brown.Green is the positive lead for the brake/turn higher brightness lights.  On most trailers, the yellow one is for the left side (driver side) and green is for the right side (passenger side).I haven't actually put everything together yet. I have wired everything up, just twisting the wires for now, to test it.  They work fine.  In full sinlight laying on the ground, I could easily see the lights were on with the parking lights on.  They seemed about as bright as the car's lights.  I turned the emergency flashers on, and the lights were quite bright, and easy to see even in direct sunlight.  They should be just fine for what I'm using these for.Update:  Forgot I never updated this with a picture after I got it put together.  The picture is only of the tail light mode.  The brake/turn mode is much brighter.  They compare favorably to the car's lights.  The picture is without bikes so you can see my car's lights for comparison.

I bought this unit several months ago and have used it every day for the last two weeks to help feed my Goal Zero Yeti 400 solar generator. It is paired with a Goal Zero 100 watt panel, which is available from Amazon for about $300. Prior to that, I used it to charge USB powered devices. While the rated output of solar panels is computed under ideal conditions (very cold, high altitude and cloudless day), this one seems to do about as well as most. On a sunny day, the panels should produce about 60% of rated capacity when angled at the sun. It is monocrystalline as opposed to the less expensive polycrystalline design.The Suaoki 60 watt panel comes with a 5.5x8mm barrel adapter. It is the largest one provided for use with notebook computers. By the way, the 5.5mm output is a bit over 19 volts. Unlike the USB output, the 5.5mm output is not regulated. I don't recommend using the unregulated output on any computer that requires substantially less than 19 volts. A picture of the Suaoki provided 5.5x8mm converter is pictured along with the Goal Zero 4 port parallel adapter. The second picture shows the input of the Soauki 60 and Goal Zero 100 on a cloudy day.Suaoki sells two solar generators. One is designed primarily for use in Japan and produces 100 volts at 50 cycles. The other appears to produce US power levels and frequencies. Unfortunately, neither has a user replaceable battery. Additionally, neither is serviced in the United States. Returning the unit to Asia can be very expensive and time consuming. Accordingly, I bought the Goal Zero Yeti 400, which has a user replaceable battery and is serviced out of Salt Lake City, Utah. Goal Zero also has an toll free telephone number manned by native English speaking technicians. For additional tips on evaluating solar generators and panels, consult UGOV.Net (American Home Emergency Preparedness).

Fit and function is great. Some cheap levers don't fit well (need to be sanded, or have big gaps), but these are great.2 problems with these levers. #1, the nuts holding the levers to their perches were quite loose. Is it that hard to tighten them down? I could wiggle the whole lever easily. #2, the color is more yellow than gold. Doesn't match my forks at all.BTW, bike is a 2016 GSX-S1000. I attached 2 pictures I have where you can see the color of the lever and the forks. Not even close. Looks even more mismatched in the sunlight.edit: After only a few months, the levers have faded to a very dim yellow. Would not recommend these as they will fade from sunlight exposure.

I used to have a non pure wave inverter, and it left lines in the video screens.  This got rid of the problem and makes sure that my ps3 sends good signal to the monitors.

I got the product quickly, the ballasts and lights and everything work, HOWEVER... the electrical plug to connect to my bike was not a direct fit. As you can see in the picture, my stock bulb (in the clear plastic case) has prongs that are wider than the kit's prongs (Black in hand) that need to plug into my bike. Instead of being plug and play, I had to cut the black plastic to retrieve each prong so they would plug into the bike individually. I then had to electrical tape them. The install should have taken 10 minutes, but instead it took over an hour. Everything else works fine, but if you can't match an H7 bulb... I don't know what to tell you.. I feel bad for your other customers.

Granted, after 13 years of use, that outdoor fan blade was not going to come easily off the shaft. But I followed the directions, put in the center punch and tightened the four external screws such that the pusher screw was centered before applying pressure to the pusher screw. The puller then slipped off the hub twice, and as I applied more pressure to the four holding screws, they deformed and finally stripped. The photo shows the mushrooming of the screw around the hub.  This is basically harbor freight quality gear.So I removed the blade the old fashioned way (which works great if you merely want to salvage the fan blade). Cut the shaft (metal sawzall) between the motor and the fan blade hub. Then mounted a 3/4  pipe vertically in my vise.  Since no shaft was showing beyond the fan hub, no need to sand anything sticking beyond the hub.  Then put the fan shaft into the pipe and whacked the shaft with a punch from above. 3 minutes later, I was done, much less time than I struggled with this tool.So, this blade puller may very well work on indoor squirrel fan assemblies where corrosion is minimal compared to an outdoor unit.  But based on my limited experience, this puller has upgrade potential, starting with the use of higher strength steel. The screws do not seem to be designed to "bite" into the collar they are supposed to secure. Tool steel would likely do a better job, especially if it was pointed. Thus, Heavy Duty is not something I would associate with this kit.Also, anyone following in my footsteps: consider putting anti seize on the next fan motor shaft before inserting it into the fan blade hub. Then seal from above with heavy grease. Hopefully, keep the water out and hence make the next removal a lot easier. I've also attached a picture of the shaft I removed. As I noted above, there was no shaft showing beyond the hub, so what you see is what was covered by the blade hub and above (i.e. towards the motor).The shaft is not even 100% corroded. There is only some rust around the part of the "D"-shaped shaft where water was able to drip down between the shaft and the collar. If that had been sealed from above (grease, bitumen, whatever) then this likely would have been clean as well. The shiny part of the shaft was not retouched, sanded, etc. This is what it looked like on removal.

Item came damaged with zero instructions or warranty information included in the box. Purchased as open box like new - Nice product otherwise but extremely disappointed and mislead by description. Weather stripping completely torn, but was needed by the date delivered so no choice but to keep it. Total waste of money. Dont buy open box!!!

I was hesitant on buying this you always hear good and bad things about these but being bluetooth just download the free app no in app purchases either it's great with the wifi ones sometimes you lose the use of your phone while useing them not this just put in your vin and it's so easy to use it is not as fast as a direct plug in let's say like a actron scanner but it's worth it there can't say how happy I am enough highly recomended and someone posted another review and showed there's in. Pelican 1010 case thanks for the great ideaUpdateStill working great a little slow but my phone is outdated but works great no problems I had also picked up a pelican 1010 case and foam perfect storage And a thank you to bluedriver for the tshirts

A handy addition to any trailer used at sites without full hookups  I bought the 18 gal size size because at 8+ lbs/gal it was all I wanted to move around at one time  The larger sizes are good if you want to go longer between dumps but have more weight on the same 4 wheels and I prefer to make 2 trips and have the wheels carry less weight. Do not forget the double male adapter fitting sold separately as it is needed to connect an elbow fitting to fit into most sewer dump stations.  If you use for black water dump your gray water second so that it flushes tote.  Great product and would buy again and recommend to others  Arrived in great shape was packaged well and arrived EARLY

Works very well. Clear instructions. I notice in the description it says works with a  43" belt. Some V-belt part numbers would be a great help.I had to use a 38 3/4" belt for my pulleys. O'Reilly part number 7380 (15380).

This is a great idea, but it is made cheaply.  I ordered it to put in my work van for when I pull the our trailer. The instructions also tell you to mount it by the E-brake pedal. That is the dumbest thing you could do. It will be kicked and broken in a matter of days. In fact mounting it almost broke it.I mounted it in pilar behind the E-brake pedal. On a 2015 Chevy Express 2500 you can pull the plastic panel and there is a nice little hole for you to mount it vertically inside of. This will protect it from being kicked and damaged.What happened to mine:I mounted it where I described above. I used 3M double sided tape to secure it to the inside of the fender. After I buttoned everything up I took it out for a test with an empty trailer. I was getting upset that it would not work all the time and was only getting sporadic braking. I stopped and removed the panel to check the wiring and found that the cheap clam shell design opened up and the electronics had spilled out. I had to squeeze my hand back into the hole and pull the box off the wall. This is in the picture. I placed the electronics back into the clam shell and used a electrical tape to tape the box shut and more of my 3M tape to remount it. After this it began to function properly.Performance:At best it is ok. It is not sensitive enought on level 1 and on level 2 it jumps to 10% as soon as you touch the brake pedal. It is too much if you are looking to slow down slowly. Loaded it works fine once you mess with it to get the setting right for the weight you have.I would not recommend it until they fix the design flaw.

Great Product and great price. I had been waiting for the price on this to drop. Very easy to install with a little knowledge of wiring a relay. I installed mine on a custom bumper on a 91 Jeep Cherokee and I had a spare relay already in there that I was able to use. Looks good and is super bright.

Holy Crap.  This muffler is insane!  I have a 130HP 1.8L 4 cylinder with 2 inch piping and a cold air intake.  I slapped this thing on the back, and the sound is unbelievable!  It's so deep, and not overly loud!  There is almost no interior drone at speed either.  I have a manual transmission, and whats really cool is that when I shift gears, the muffler gives a subtle POP or CRACKLE!  If you're into that kind of sound effect.  It looks really good too.  The burnt tip feature is a nice touch, but I don't know how long that will last.  Once this one needs replacing, I will definitely order another N1 Muffler!

I bought this for my car after seeing all the 5 star reviews. I've tried other leather conditioners before and was sorely disappointed as most left a tacky residue . Leather honey is no different. It's a clear viscous liquid from the bottle(almost like dishwashing liquid, thicker than olive oil), which makes it difficult to apply sparingly. Fortunately I did only the drivers seat and not all the leather surfaces. It definitely leaves a tackiness to the leather, I could feel it especially as I pivot in and out of the seat. Wiping with a clean cloth does very little. I ended up scrubbing out the remaining residue.I didn't give up on Leather Honey. Maybe it was just the car right?So anyway I decided to give it a try LH on some newly tooled coasters I just made. I also tried other leather protectants and finishes, while I was doing this. The Leather Honey SIGNIFICANTLY darkened the LEFT most coaster. Raw vegetable tanned leather is all the way to the right for a color comparison -? I put it on using a sponge as sparingly as I could, wit occasional use of a fine round brush to fill in missed areas. I was tempted to simply mash the sponge into those areas as veggie tanned leather is quite thirsty. I let it sit for overnight and blotted out the rest with a paper towel in the morning.  After two weeks the LH coaster still felt quite oily to the touch, but it was soft. So soft I could roll that coaster into a taquito. I blotted out as much as I could while rolled. I tested out the finishes I had applied by placing ice water in a glass and the LH one did not appear to absorb water, but I noticed that it left smear on the surface it was sitting and as the condensation dripped to the base.. I decided to give the LH a scrubbing, maybe there was still excess. I used a tooth brush, dishwashing liquid and some water, my hands ended up coated with a greasy gunk. The leather honey had begun to weep out of the coaster and all over my hands. This was what was leaving the smear on the table. Definitely not gonna use this for water protecting leather, this could end up damaging a nice hardwood table or staining an expensive shirt!!!

I used this jack for a 48 foot boat trailer. When I went to put the boat on the trailer for the first time I ran into a problem. I couldn't safely grab the boat and lower it. Instead I used the tongue jack to bring the trailer up to the boat. I put blocks under the back of the trailer and used the tongue jack to raise the entire trailer up to it met the boat. What happened next blew me away. This tongue jack lifted my entire 5500 pound trailer off the ground and lifted the 26,000 pound boat with it. The trailer tires were off the ground! This jack must have lifted at least 7500 pounds if not more .

I used this stuff to coat numerous polished and unpolished aluminum components on a 427 Ford Sideoiler I built 18 years ago.I coated the polished valve covers, the unpolished intake manifold and cylinder heads, water pump, pulleys, brackets, and pretty much any other aluminum parts.With the only exception being it turned slightly brown immediately adjacent to the extremely hot exhaust ports, everything still looks exactly as it did nearly 2 decades ago.I initially sprayed it with a touch-up gun, but found that a good horsehair brush gives equally good results with much less prep and cleanup work.As with all POR-15 products I've used, it exceeded my expectations, but does require proper prep and application procedures.

Love this product, looks and works great. You can definitely tell the difference when your turning lol. Mine is a daily driver to work and a toy when I get the chance to use it.Boy what a pain in the a$$ those plastic pieces were to get in the bumper. The trick that finally worked for me was to angle it into the bumper slightly so that holds itself in place, and then slam the crap out of it with a rubber mallet. You're going to get some plastic scrappings after it's slammed in there, they really wanted a tight mofo'ing fit. Otherwise, everything else is suppper easy to install. Took about 5 minutes of cussing at the plastic pieces and then 20 minutes or less to put everything on.

Was A LOT smaller than I had expected, the pictures aren't scaled very well, also expected more than I got, but it was enough to do the job and helped keep a LOT of water out of my car (the original door seals don't quite cover it all so I needed some added help. Was concerned about other reviews which stated the haphazard way the product is placed in the box for shipping. It is a little chaotic, but with patience, it comes off the roll clean. This product does the job! I used it for the hatches on my bass boat, and not a drop of water has found its way in! You can't go wrong if you apply the 3M adhesive to a clean surface.Received this product at a discount for my fair and honest review.

This is the perfect tank bag for me and my V-Star.  The speedometer and lights are built into the top of the tank, so any larger bag would cover up necessary instrument panels.At first I was disappointed because I could easily lift this bag off of my tank, but when I tried to mimic wind by pulling it down, it was very secure.  Since then, it has held up perfectly to 90+ MPH speeds.The top has a small zipper compartment in which I put my keys for work/home.  I use the pocket of the main compartment to store my LCP, and the rain cover to conceal the firearm when the bag is opened.  In the main compartment, I keep my wallet, hearing protection, and anything else that would go in my pockets if I were in my car.  I haven't found a use for the clear "map pocket," other than blinding myself with the reflection.  I will probably just remove it.  It is secured by velcro and a few snaps, so it is easily removable.  It could fit my Note 5, but I have a handlebar mount for that.I keep an Anker battery pack inside as well, and there is a small hole protected by rubber through which I can feed the micro usb cable to my phone.  The rubber secured the cord so the wind does not pull the cord out farther than where I secure it.  Even at speeds of 100+ the cord does not get forced out by the wind.Many people have complained about the top handle flopping around and banging on their gas tank.  There is an easy solution to this:With the bag upright and the magnets facing you, rotate the top handle backwards twice.  This will force the handle against the bag, and keep it in place so the handle will not move while riding.

Lead is malleable and corrosion resistant. Though not the most conductive metal, I trust it because its the same material as the battery posts therefore you don't have to worry about dissimilar metals and galvanic corrosion.

Please leave a comment if you have any questions I'll be happy to help.I purchased this repair kit so I had spares of both the smaller standard sizes hitches.My intent was to add these to my "Emergency RV repair toolkit" so if myself or any other traveler has issues I would be prepared and have plenty of spares.This folds nicely flat in the bottom of the tool kit and doesn't take up too much space. I've included a photo of my kit and circled these hitch repair parts in that toolkit.For the price and piece of mind having the spare before you need it, especially when you're traveling; this is well worth it.

These ramps appear to be well made and I really like that the raised "holes" provide traction while snow, dirt, mud etc. fall through them for the best grip from the tires of the equipment being loaded. I'm using mine specifically for bringing my Kubota BX tractor in and out of my barn with a raised subfloor that's on skids. When not in use I'll simply take them down and hang them up. They won't be permanently mounted. I do however want to mirror another buyer's note that the ends that should be placed on the raised surface (think a truck's tailgate) are welded V-bars. Unfortunately mine were also damaged in shipping. This is a weakness that concerns me when considering safety. See picture.Edit: Well I gave it a shot. I figured since the ends that were resting on the barn floor (earlier described as the "V" bar) are designed to hold 1500 pounds each that the slight bend would take my 1500 pound Kubota without a problem. The bend straightened out to it's factory position under load. Then the bar snapped off entirely and the ramp fell to the ground. When 1500 pounds falls out from under you I'll tell you first hand it makes your heart skip a beat. I safely backed the tractor back onto solid ground and then inspected the ramps. The end bar sheared right off at the highest bending point and also the "steps" supporting the tires are also badly bent from the weight. Poor design. Weight rating is inaccurate. These ramps make a dangerous loading situation even more dangerous with these failures. Time to visit a welder and use these for loading my push mower into the barn.

One is not enough to completely dry my Optima's panels and glass, but I like it enough to buy a second one. That will be sufficient. It works well using the pat method, which I prefer. I hang it inside to dry. I don't hang it outside where it can catch dust and debris from the wind. Don't forget to remove the tag.

The only thing that sucks about these lights is the shipping. The product was $5.89 and the shipping was $ 5.10. They are not brighter, but a totally different kind of light. I found them just as bright as the stock Honda ones, but instead of a yellow light you get a white light. I've attached some pictures so check them out. Installation was easy and hassle free. Lets see how long they last.

Did this nearly 6 months ago. Appears very tough and durable. Be sure to follow the instructions. I used bulldog adhesion promoter just before application and after sanding. I used nearly a gallon to spray the sides of my pickup. The color (desert tan) was quite a bit lighter than I wanted.Also since I used the texture pellets it was very hard to determine how thick the application was and I now have some rust showing through. It should be easy to touch up.Do not try this indoors without the garage door open, it's incredibly smelly.The description says the order will include a spray gun and mine did not, so I had to ask for one. It took another week to get it so that's the reason I did not do 5 stars.

Just installed it today. My old Radiator developed a small crack on top of the radiator plastic part. The car has 178K on it and this was the original radiator. Thankfully the leak developed maybe a mile from home so when i was leaving the car i smelled the antifreeze, looked under the hood and saw the to of radiator full of antifreeze. Minute later I was on Amazon.com ordering this Denso exact replacement. Replacing it took maybe 2 hours mostly due to a very rusty bolts and nuts as well as being my very first Radiator replacement job so I didn't want to make any mistakes.. I definitely advice anyone attempting to do this for the very first time to watch few short movie on youtube . From the movies it looked like a very straight forward job and trust me, anyone can do this on Camry. Part was an exact replacement. Picture showing very common crack on the radiator on older Camry cars.

Application: 2003 Honda Odyssey EXMy van's performance slowly degraded to the point that it was 'hunting' for the top gear (actually the torque converterlockup) under slight incline and light throttle conditions. With the EGR passages being relatively clean and the original EGR valve having 190K miles on it, I figured it was time for a new one.I immediately noticed the port on the new part was a smaller, semi-circle shape compared to the rectangular port on the original part. The port on the vehicle's EGR mounting surface is rectangular as well as the gasket provided with the new part, so it was clear that this was different.I was going on a long trip the next day, so I opted to give this one a try. I did notice better engine performance, but my mileage was only 22-23 MPG where I usually got 26. This led me to believe that this part, even though better than one that was at the end of its service life, may not be allowing optimal performance.Standard Motor Products does not appear to have public-facing tech support, so I was not able to contact them for clarification. I did, however, reach the nice folks at Wells Electronics (they also provide many of the quality Duralast house brand products from AutoZone). They indicated that the correct part is&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Wells-EGR4201-EGR-Valve/dp/B000IYRHAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Wells EGR4201 EGR Valve</a>. If you see an off-site picture of this part (not shown on Amazon's listing), you'll see the port on this one IS rectangular, so it will match the application's EGR mounting plate port.I'm disappointed for these reasons:1. Standard Motor Products does not have customer support on Amazon2. The application info is WRONG on this listing3. The application info for a 2003 Honda Odyssey is WRONG on the correct part for the 2003 Odyssey,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Wells-EGR4201-EGR-Valve/dp/B000IYRHAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Wells EGR4201 EGR Valve</a>...how many other part applications are also incorrect? (Nov 17, 2015 edit: The make/model/year fitment for the part seems to have been corrected--thanks Jan 7 2016 EDIT!! I see the seller is indicating that this is the correct application again---WRONG!)4. The correct part doesn't have pictures that show the mount-side ports, helping us determine the correct part.I now have to order the correct part and return the incorrect one. This is an inconvenience due to an application chart being wrong at either the Amazon, retailer or industry database level.If you are contemplating replacing your EGR valve, take my advice of removing your old one first and making sure the new port matches your EXACTLY. Sorry to 'vent' (get it? EGR....vent....ha ha), but this is a mistake in the supply chain's information database that needs to fixed NOW.Best wishes with your project.**Jan 5 2016 UPDATE**I finally got around to ordering the Wells EGR mentioned above and indeed our 2003 Honda Odyssey runs better especially at the higher end (5th gear and torque converter lockup). I just got back from a 2000+ mile drive which included the Appalachians and the van performed great with the correct Wells EGR---no unnecessary hunting back and forth on inclines.The attached picture shows the Standard Motor Products EGV658 I had on my van for the past year. Note how a majority of the orifice is closed whereas the Wells EGR has the same size port as the original I took off. One picture shows the original taken off my Odyssey and the correct Wells EGR.Since Standard Motor Parts is either misrepresenting their applications or isn't paying attention, I have just downgraded this part to 1 star. Don't buy this if you have a 2003 Honda Odyssey, it isn't the correct part.

It's a plug, it's OEM, it fits and prevent oil from the engine to run away. I bought mine somewhere else as it was a bit cheaper. On my 2001 Civic LX, I have noticed some oil on the side of the engine. Sure enough, the plug was leaking slowly. Reading about it and how easy it was to swap it, I ordered one. It seems like the orientation (line) doesn't really matter but I tried to aligned them to the engine.To do the task I did the following:1) jack up the car on the passenger side (this will prevent the oil from the engine to run away2) pry gently with a screw driver the cap, you'll hear a pop when out, clean up the area with a rag3) rub some oil around the new plug O-Ring in order to seal properly (use the same oil as your engine), no need to use RTV4) go on the driver side of the engine and pull the plug in making sure the tabs are inside (I found it was easier this way than trying to push it in due to the space limitation), you'll hear a pop when in5) clean up the plug area with rag6) un-jack the car and check for leaksYou are done!Enjoy your new unleaky plug!

Menzerna FG 400 is a German made product with 'Diminishing Abrasive Technology' that can be used with either a heavy or medium cutting pad. FG400 has the ability to be worked longer with minimal hazing and dusting leaving behind a stunning last step appearance.If Menzerna FG400 does leave behind a haze, you can easily remove by switching to a softer grade pad combined with Menzerna SF4000 or your favorite light cutting polishI have my favorite polishes and compounds for boats ( 3M Perfect It), rvs, automobiles and UFO's but FG400 could be substituted for any of those other go to products, leaving behind brilliant results. I've been using FG400 since it first hit the American market in 2012 and it immediately became one of my favorite detailing products and still is today. FG 400 is oily, so if applying a sealant or coating as last step protection, you'll need to wipe down applied surface with CarPro Eraser or IPA before applying to achieve maximum  adhesionEnough of words ... I've attached some pics of the end results from using Menzerna FG400 in combination with with a Buff & Shine yellow pad....

I got these for my 2012 Ram 3500 Crew cab and they fit great! I wish they were a little more rubbery because they are a little on the stiff side. They do great job of covering alot of "exposed" carpet.  Another thing I would of liked for them to go up a little higher on the passenger side and driver side by the center console. Either way they perform great they look great! Im extremely happy with them. Everyone that gets in my truck is impressed with them. Thank you!

I travel a lot my family, The one year we went to Hawaii in the middle of a pretty big storm. All you could see is the waves crashing on the roads. All we could think about is the car getting swept out to sea with us in it. That whole rest of the trip we wished and talked about getting one of these GOOACC Car Hammer Seatbelt Cutter Emergency Tools. You here of people that couldn't get out of there cars from there seatbelts getting stuck to they were not able to break the glass from to much water pressure. This can do it all. What ever you need to survive something like that. So needless to say we take this every where we go and any trip we go on now. Its nice to know that the tool is at your disposal if and when you need it. We also have the piece of mind that its with us. Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount price for my honest and unbiased review.  I will like to thank the seller (  galigetget ) for the opportunity to review there product

I just got this today and started reading the instructions for programming the remote.  I was concerned that the first line on the instruction sheet read "All 2011 + vehicles require dealer or locksmith programming only."  I have a 2011 Tacoma, but this worked fine for my year.I followed the instruction the first time and made a small mistake on the procedure, which will cause the programming to fail. It must be done exactly how the direction say to do it.  It took me a couple attempts before I got it right, so be patient and it'll work fine.  The directions look ridiculous, but you have to place your vehicle in program mode and that's never an easy thing to do.  They are designed like that so you can't accidentally place it into programming mode.  There's no way you can accidentally do the steps in this order.  Good luck and may the Force be with you!

These Mirrors are awesome.  This is my second pair, as the first pair broke when a car struck my bike.  Anyway, they have great near vision due to the convex shape of the mirrors.  They are easy to install and can be tightened down right where ya want them.  If something happens to them, spend another $10 and get a new pair.

the bits keep spinning out of my black and decker drill and falling right in the sand. i eventually just stopped every few seconds and tightened it back the best i could. the round part that sticks into the drill is to long and the chuck cant grasp onto the part it needs too. i know my before and after pictures looks great but im not impressed. first of all i sanded the metal with 180, 360, and 400. I wish i would of had some 600 but i don't think it would of changed the end results that much. I think what i was really missing for the results im truly after would be a real buffer and those rouge stones. they are little bricks of polish you rub your buffer on, and in the videos online you can tell it shines after, like chrome even. anyways, theres no real shine to my finished product and you can just barely see a reflection. Im going to get what i really need and start all over. also my polish was watery, and ive used mothers before, its supposed to be a paste. not a happy camper at all, you get what you pay for. if you want your metal to shine, find some one with that right tools or get them yourself. I find the uploaded pictures on this product very suspicious, and don't let mine fool you either. I know it looks 100x better but its no where near the shine i was striving for. i honestly believe with the proper tools i can get this metal mirror like, probably 3x better than my current results. Which makes me believe more was used than just this polish kit in some of these before and after pictures, i mean obviously, but this whole kit could of been skipped and still had much better results in my honest opinion.

Was looking for a good set of pads for my JK. Most ceramic brakes I have bought in the past had little to no dust what so ever. Reviews on these didn't seem too bad so figured I give them a try. Honestly, I should have just spent more $$ and got some pads worth changing.  Heavy brake dust with just normal to slow daily driving. No hard stops, no riding the brakes. Dust quickly covers rims and tires in the matter of 2-3 days. To the point that my black rims and tires turn a nasty brown color. Guess I'll be doing a second brake job to throw these away.

Thank you amazon for same day shipping. Saved my nipples from freezing and driving with luxury heat! 2002 7.3. Air condition and vents working except when heat is turned on, actuator would not open vent to the heater core. This fixed it.To those installing this, pry it off with a flat screwdriver. Use a 7mm to turn it counter clockwise very slowly to position it correctly like the old one you took out. Wiggle it in then snap it on its attachment posts and you are good to go. Its not important the exact position of the actuator b/c the mounting holes are oblong and allow some wiggle room for installation. Cheers!

I am pretty happy with this purchase. First off these are NOT compatible with CK sockets so if you need those do not buy these. I purchased these for my 2007 Jeep Wrangler JKU to replace the front turn signals in the grill so I took some specific measurements that might help people out. These will fit your front turn signals perfectly however if you do not care about the dimensional specs just go ahead and feel comfortable purchasing these they work and fit great. They are a little on the yellow side rather then amber but I have smoked lenses in the front anyway so it is not really noticeable.Aaron 3157 LedL: 2.48"W: .70"Insertable length: 1.72" (What actually will be inside the enclosure and not inserted in the base of the socket. This is the important measurement because they are significantly longer than the stock 3157 bulbs (see my photos for reference)Stock 3157 BulbL: 1.92"W: .98" (at max width of the glass)Insertable length: .60"2007-2016 Jeep Wrangler / Unlimited front turn signal openings:W: 1.05"D: 2.25"

NOTE: I had a hard time confirming what light bars would fit, or not, with certain mounts.  As mentioned below, I ordered a 50 inch STRAIGHT LED Light bar off of Amazon.  The fit was nothing short of PERFECT...I bought this for my 2016 Jeep JK Unlimited Sahara.  I also order a 50 Autofeel 5D STRAIGHT (NOT CURVED) LED light bar.  I was a little skeptical about ordering this, due to some negative reviews, but I figured I'd give it a shot.  I like the look of this mount much better than the Rough Country, which I feel is the mark for affordable JK Light Bar Mounts.The mounts showed up at my home.  I immediately unboxed them, and was VERY IMPRESSED by how substantial they looked/felt.  During the install, I did notice that the holes didn't match up 100% with the body of the JK, but with some common sense, and leaving certain bolts loose until I got the others started in the holes, I was easily able to get every bolt screwed in perfectly.  The mount also came with some rubberized pieces to go between the mounts, and the body of the jeep/windshield.  Once I got both mounts installed, I called my neighbor to help me lift the light bar into place.  I started the screws in each side of the light, and it fit like a GLOVE.  ABSOLUTELY PERFECT FIT.  The light was perfectly level, and the mounts fit the body of the Jeep wonderfully...In closing, I HIGHLY recommend these mounts.  CAN NOT BE BEAT FOR THE MONEY.
Great fit!

This tool does work as advertised and will remove Jiffy-Tite fitting connectors. The storage case is nicely constructed and should last a long time. The tools are also decently made and should last a long time, if not subjected to abuse.However, the brad that functions as a hinge is not a tight fit and allows quite a bit of lateral movement, side to side. Additionally, the finish on the sharper edges, where the tool is inserted into the fitting, had burrs and was bent up a bit. I had to clean these edges before I initially used it. The first two pictures show some of the burrs. Look on the sharp edges to see the burrs. Sorry the pictures aren't better - I only had my phone camera at work.Lisle makes some decent tools, and this one would have received five stars if the finish quality was better, or the price was lower. I buy a lot of tools and recognize when the quality justifies the price. This tool falls short.I've also included pictures of the female and male side of the fitting, as well as the clip that needs to be spread to disconnect the fitting. I used this to replace the turbos on a 2014 Ford F-150 EcoBoost. It was tight, but this tool allowed me to remove the upper water pipe without removing the vacuum pump. A definite time saver.I recommend this tool and would buy it again.

First thing I tried to do was bolt the bracket up. Put some blue lock tight on and went for it. Had pulled up a U-tube video just to make sure since it does not come with directions. Guy pointed out the frame had paint in the built in nut that u screw the bolt into so its hard to get it screwed in. So im screwing it in and just about to get all the way out of the nut and the darn bolt broke of in my frame! This can happen to anyone since the two large bolts are very soft so u might think your just cutting paint... Come to find out they are the wrong bolts. Why would u put metric bolts for something that should be standard. Now I have to try and get this broken bolt out, then go buy the correct ones. Not happy at all. U would think they would have tried putting it on at least once to make sure it would work without problems like this. HEADS UP buyers.

This seat cushion is such a lifesaver when I'm working! It is made of nice memory foam & keeps my hips & back aligned where they're supposed to be. Sooo much more comfortable than my regular office chair seat!  I also really like the fact that the cover is removable & can be washed. I'd like to get one for my car as well. I recieved this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review and I would recommend this seat cushion.

Solid, standard replacement radiator for 90% of 90-97 Miatas on the road. Regardless of what the Amazon car configurator says, this works on Manual and Auto cars (just ignore the trans cooler lines when installing in a manual car).If the plastic top on your Miata radiator is brown/green/yellow-ish (pic on the left side), you have a ticking time bomb on your hands. DANGER TO RADIATOR!For most street driven Miatas, this is all you need...as long as your cooling system is in good shape. The radiator in the 1990 i just bought had a 1996 sticker on it...20 years old! I'll be more than pleased to get a solid 10 out of this new one. I replaced this and every coolant hose (including the Cursed Water Plug) on the car.Many people have mentioned that these are rebranded Koyos. I did not see any mention of Koyo on the part or the box, mine was labeled "TYC | China".There are aluminum options out there for not much more, but I saw many reviews of the cheap ones springing leaks. If you are going aluminum, spend the bucks and go top shelf. I would rather spend under a Benjamin for a stock replacement and know that the tanks will wear out at some point, but I won't be hanging around waiting for it to randomly spring a leak.

I purchased this to cover a spare tire on a trailer that will spend most of its life uncovered.Worked well out of the box.  Fit the 15" spare well and there is a hook on the back to help keep it tight.  Won't flap around in the wind and has a nice clean look to it.Attached is a picture of the sizing chart from the box.  I struggled to figure out the right size due to conflicting information.  Hopefully this helps someone.

The center cap HELO doesn't stand out to much but just right not to take away from the wheel.

Cover fits as expected.  It is a somewhat lightweight material (as expected), but appears water resistant.  The 6' poles with it are LOUSY for putting this on a full sized (tall) 5th wheel.  I bought 10' conduit and still had a little struggle getting it on.  20 minutes, plus time to snap the buckles.  Not that bad at all ... but 5 minutes is a bit of a belly laugh for me.I'd recommend this for someone needing an economy cover.

They fit a scion tC poifectly! They really add allot to the interior. Either these or the blue ones will add allot of flair to your car depending on what your color scheme is. I was surprised as to the overall fitment in the tC considering it's a generic mat. Very happy with these, especially for the low price!

I bought this to remove the steering head races from a friends 2001 Triumph Bonneville. The design of the steering head leaves little room for using  a punch or similar tool to tap them out. The tool came yesterday and the races were out in short order. The biggest challenge was finding the appropriate socket to use as a driver, as the neck of the frame is not a straight shot. So with as big of a socket that would fit on the tool and inside the neck, connected to an 1/2 inch extension, and using my no bounce hammer, out they came.The packaging says the tool is made in Taiwan, and the driving lip is well formed and clean of any tooling. I could not see any deformation of the lip after use. I'm very please with this one use.

I love this, very heavy duty and it worked to magnetize a screwdriver.  Now, if I can just get hubby to use it when he takes things apart!  People complained about the label being hard to remove, yes, it is really stuck on there (don't know why companies insist on doing that when there are removable glues now).  Anyway, with my trusty Scotty Peeler and De-Solv-It, it was not bad at all.  See my photos of removing it.

Shine is out of this world. Just used it yesterday on a brand new Hyundai. Make sure you let it haze or it's hard to remove. I would say this is a tough to remove wax. Consumer Reports states it's easily removed but I disagree. Perhaps the next coat will be easier but the car looks great! I used a clay bar on this car before waxing.

I've always had a problem hearing the CB since I installed it in the center console armrest area in my Xterra. I didn't want to put an external speaker out in the open, but I finally decided to see if I could put it under the dash.Just bought the RoadPro RPSP-15 for $12 on Amazon and found a spot under the dash on the drivers side where I could mount it. I just ziptied it on with 2 zipties, ran the wire to my CB under the shifter and cup holders, and made sure it was all wrapped in 1/4" split loom.I got to try it out last weekend on the trail with my off-road club and it worked great, sounded nice and loud and clear. No regrets, might be the best <$20 mod I've done!

There are a couple of reviews about this product that state is isn't Scotchlite. It is indeed Scotchlite, even though the package insert is Scotchcal. I researched the 3M product number (79922), and it is described as Scotchlite. To make sure, I purchased a roll of 79922 directly from 3M (twice the price of Amazon). Same packaging, same insert, same stuff. This product has an adhesive liner sheet that has to be stripped off to apply the tape. I found this product best applied when surfaces and tape are warmer rather than cooler. There is a clear plastic liner on the black surface of the tape that must be peeled away for the reflective properties to work. Once peeled away, it shines bright white when light is directed at it. The only thing that disappoints is that the angle of reflection is very shallow. The material is most reflective when your eyes are at 90 degrees to the material. 2 degrees or so off 90, either up or down, and the reflective properties diminish quickly. I would say that 5 degrees of 90 and the reflection is gone.I've put this product on the black luggage of one of my motorcycles. This bike is so black from the factory that I don't feel comfortable riding it at night. Adding this material give me a little piece of mind. The surfaces on the luggage are flat, and at a slight upward angle from level, so we'll see how well it works. I also applied some of this material to the tube structure that the luggage mounts to. This will give larger angular visibility to the rear of the bike.4 stars only because of the very shallow reflective angle. A few more degrees and it would be a 5 star product.***EDIT*** Changed to 5 stars. This make my bike MUCH more visible at night! And, the reflected angle is actually larger than I reported above. Am going to apply around base of my helmet as well as higher up on the back, to really be night visible! Will try and upload pics.

the fit is not totally perfect but I was expecting that since this is universal but still is really nice those front seats (the back one is a little harder and does not have holes for seatbelts so you have to cut it), easy to install and full of instructions plus videos on their site so you don't have to worry about that, it took me about 15 min per seat +20~25 rear seat.I really like the material that this is made of.

My new digital air gauge came in the mail today, its a nice modern instrument. Not crazy about the color (red) but nice. has readings in 4 different measurements PSI,BAR,KPA,KGF/CM admittedly I have no idea other then PSI. I have to say if you wear reading glasses make sure you have them on as the digital display is tiny; the first time I used it I forgot my glasses had to go home and get them impossible to read without, not a fault of the gauge I don't think a bigger display is possible on a hand held gauge. Once I had my glasses on it was fine good accurate reading, and it lights so you can use it at night very convenient. fits nicely into any glove box. In the event that you have a low tire this will wind up paying for itself. Two times i've avoided being stranded on the side of the road because I knew the tire was low, avoiding a potential highway blowout.The good Fits in glove box Feels right in hand Lights up for night useThe bad The tiny display

I purchased this cover to take to Sturgis with me this year as I don't like my bike being wet in the morning when I get up. The bad ass Moto gear cover seem to fit the bill. Good reviews and A quality product. It arrived a few days before I was due to leave so I tossed it in with the rest of the gear. Last night I went to put it on the bike and No go. Apparently when this product was packaged they used heat & highbpressure to fold it in as compact size as they could. After struggling with this thing for close to a half an hour I gave up and called it a night. First thing this morning I thought I would try again. The rubber inner lining is so  fused Together you literally have to rip it apart. To the point where you don't know if you're pulling apart something you shouldnt. This morning I spentvabout 20 minutes trying to pull this thing apart , Ive got better things to do so I left it as the picture shows and maybe sometime later when it hits 90+ degrees I may be able to pull it apart. From what I could see It looks top quality. Ill update after Ive had a chance to use it.

The factory filter is always going to be the best choice, but for the price I would say the Mann-filter comes pretty close. The filter replaced an old one in a 2013 XC90. Outside of the standard Volvo filter location complaint, the filter wiggled in with minimal issues.

While it states on the box, "Works with most devices powered or charged by AC, USB or 12 volt power ports", the same can be said that it does NOT work with most devices. This is because for its 110v outlets it uses a Modified Wave Inveter. It tries to make Ac current but does not do the job well. Should work fine for anything with an electric motor that does not exceed 200 watts (400w peak). I used it during a power outage with some 9 watt CFL and LED light bulbs to light my home. Would not turn on an electric throw blanked.As another reviewer pointed out, it would not work with a laptop's power supply. This person attached another inverter to the 12 volt sockets and stated it works for the laptop. I made the mistake and purchased two of the same inverters in that review. It should be pointed out that that inveter may have worked on the laptop, but is also a Modified Sine Wave inveter. Must just be a better one than what is in this power station. but it still does not work an electric blanket. I searched Amazon again and found a Bestek Pure Sine Wave inveter that does work an electric blanket. And it was not much more money than the previous inverter.But be careful when using an inverter on the 12 volt sockets. They are only good for a 15amp draw. As I was checking what the Bestek inverter in the 12 volt outlet could do, I lost power to both sockets. The manual stated that there is a circuit breaker and it would work again after a few seconds. Well mine never worked again. Contacted Schumacher Customer service at first told me to return it. Once I stated Amazon's policy of not being able to return this particular item, they sent me a return shipping label. But I was not going to give up. Not knowing what kind of breakers the unit has, I disconnected the battery as power needs to be removed for some breakers to reset. This did not help. So I removed the battery and looked around inside. I saw NO breakers, but did see two 20amp fuses in a hard to get place, one which was blown. Luckily after being in the auto repair business for 30+ years, I have a selection of tools. With some hooks and angled pliers I was able to remove the fuse and replace it and once again, the 12 volt sockets work.Aired up a tire within a few minutes. As for the accuracy of the tire gauge on the unit, I can't say because my Amflo tire gauge compared with may not be accurate. But the power station's tire gauge has a light that comes on while the compressor is running. The hose for filling tires is not very long. Should work fine for most if the back of the unit where the hose is faces the wheel. But then you can't easily see the gauge and if using the small work light on the unit, it won't be facing the work.Has ports to inflate and deflate. I assume for things like an air mattress. I have none to test it with.While the 110volt outlets may not work with your cell phones wall charger (or maybe any charger), the USB port should.If it does not work with a 110volt electric blanket, I can't imagine it work with a hot plate. So take a BBQ with you when camping. Should work with a blender though for the refreshments.

6/2/17 After getting caught in some rain I has to do a good cleaning and polishing on bike, I noticed surface rust already popping up.The good. Arrived early with free shipping. 5 stars for that. The pretty good. Fitment is tight but not to tight. Sturdy. Pulled up on rack and raised bike up. The decent. Couple of places chrome isn't great but not in plain view. The front attachment points will need a little attention. Left to right they fit great but the cutout is Just a tad big. Not biggie but might rattle over time. That's it. For the money I would buy again and recommend. 2017 FLHX

I think it might depend on the type of fog lamp you got in your car... my 2007 Sienna has a center shield type to prevent blinding oncoming traffic so it is not as bright as I hope you would be.  Nothing like the photo from some peoples who posted them here for sure.  Here is mine about six feet from the garage door.  Overall, it is a good bulb and hopefully it will last a few years.

I don't always write a review but felt I needed to for these. Some people were complaining about the straps, they have a loop on one end to attach to the ramp and a hook on the other to attach to truck or trailer. These seem very sturdy and fold to fit under machine in the bed.

Although the box they were shipped in was open, all parts arrived safely.  It took two tries to get the loop for the valve stem in the right orientation, but other than that no problem installing them.  The plastic seemed fairly flexible, and there seemed to be no danger of them cracking or breaking.  I used a rubber mallet to seat them firmly on the wheel.  I wonder of the reviewers who had problems with them breaking were trying to install them in very cold weather, which might make the plastic more brittle.  They don't look quite as good as in the product photos, which make them look chrome, but still not bad.  And for the price, you can't beat them.

I bought these because the Amazon website said they fit my car. In all fairness to Amazon, that website also states: "The information provided is ONLY a guide. To insure proper lug nut, lug bolt or wheel lock selection, refer to your current lug nut to determine correct lug nut style and thread size for your vehicle."  I don't remember if  that disclaimer was there when I placed my order and, if it was, if I read it.When I started this quest, I knew almost nothing about lug nuts. Now, after much research, I realize that they come in all sorts of sizes, shapes, lengths, and styles, open end and closed end, right hand and left hand thread, 3 types of seats, and more. The type of seat is very important, because that's where the compatibility of the lug nut with the wheel comes into play.  Wrong lug nut and the mounting hole gets chewed up and your wheel is toast. Just because the lug nut is the right thread, doesn't mean it's the right nut.So... the first thing you should do if you're thinking about buying new lug nuts from Amazon is to remove one old lug nut from your car and compare it to the pictures on Amazon. If I had done so, I wouldn't be writing this review.  Fortunately, returns are easy and free on Amazon.These Gorilla Automotive 91733 Acorn Bulge Chrome Lug Nuts are high quality and I would give them 5 stars, except for the fact that the seat is incorrect for my car. Amazon's website says it fits my late model Jaguar, but Amazon is wrong; it is not the proper lug nut for OEM Jaguar wheels. This lug nut has an "acorn seat" with no washers; the OEM lug nuts have built-in washers and are called "flat" or "mag seat". Using the incorrect lug nut is unsafe. See the attached photos, in particular the one that shows the differences between seat types - (1) Acorn, also called Conical or Tapered; (2)/Mag, also called Flat; and (3) Ball, also called Radius.One other thing - be sure to keep one set of OEM lug nuts and the OEM socket wrench and tools in your car, since you'll need them for your spare wheel/tire in case you get a flat. The new ones might not work.

This Jeep air deflector does exactly what you would hope it to do. No longer do I have to drive by peeking through the clean areas between the thick splattering of bugs that was my front windshield. Now most just fly up and over the roof, granted you will still hit some of the larger ones, but that's part of the charm of a Jeep. All told, I would say that this product reduced the insect explosions on my windshield by about 80%.Add to that the fact that it really does look nice on the front of the Jeep, and was very easy to install with just a few included screws.

The gaskets and O-rings all fit up perfect with no problems. BE SURE to just press straight down and not run your finger across and push down the corners first. USE PLENTY OF ASSEMBLY LUBE (as you can see in my pic.It loses a star because of the material. It is very soft and that kind of quality scares me. The original was a very strong metal and I was able to beat it out with a rubber mallet - causing no damage.I had to get this new one back out of the housing because of my own mistake by putting in the smaller o-ring of the 2 smallest ones (I have an 03' - 6.0 - F250, which doesn't need the smallest o-ring) and didn't realize it until I saw the slightly bigger one laying there after. So when beating this one out using the SAME method (mind you, it was greased up really well so it didn't take much force) and it bent both "coolant inlet/out" fitting faces down and one end chipped once tried to get the Orings back off with an Oring removing "pick" tool.With all that being said... Kudos to Dorman for honoring the warranty and replacing it with ZERO questions or trying to get out of it. It was replaced with the exact same model and I got everything in perfect (including all new gaskets and orings... once again - perfect fit) and did not have to put any force to it by doing it right this time.Being that this was my own installation mistake,,, I will be sure to come back and comment in a few months after it runs for awhile to be sure and provide a review for the important part... If it actually works right! If it is running well, I will change it to 5 stars.

I bought these to level my small motorhome when I am camping, and recently they came in handy. They had no problem holding up the front end of  the vehicle, and I was parked on them for days. In this case, I needed more lift on the driver side than the passenger side, so I drove up on one ramp (driver side) until I was level left to right, then inserted the right ramp and drove up to the desired height. They didn't sink into the ground, and they are plenty big to accommodate a small truck tire.

Due to 3 snow storms that prevented me from doing this bearing swap earlier, I am now passed the window of return. DESPITE this part being listed for a 2004 Lincoln LS - it IS NOT the correct part. It is not the same diameter, or even the same shape. This company should be ashamed of themselves selling an essential part for a car that the part was not designed to fit. Now I have a car in my driveway that cannot be driven, a job to go to tomorrow that I cannot get to, and (literally with any falsehood what so ever) a SICK son with a 102 deg F fever that I cannot even get him to the doctor's office, which I scheduled the appointment for this afternoon under a false belief that this part would fit as it was listed to fit. I am enclosing pics to prove my statements. I am furious!The first pic is the two pulleys side by side. My old part is on the right with the WRONG part on the left - notice the lip on the old part and zero lip on the WRONG part sold by this company. The second pic shows the old part fitting COMPLETELY inside the WRONG part without touching any of the sides of the wrong part - the diameter is nearly 0.4" different from the correct part.Even the kids hired by Advanced and AutoZone can use a computer to identify the correct part vs an incorrect part. I do not know what I am going to do now.

I purchased 2 kits, one as a gift and one for my Jeep. Both kits and installs went easy and look/fit just the same as OE hitch. No need to remove bumper to get nuts in place. It is tight though. I stole a move from the NASCAR Playbook (think lug nuts glued to wheels) by supergluing the washers on the bumper side to the hitch. Made it easier since I only had to get the nuts in place with help from a little masking tape and an open end wrench. Wiring harness installs easy and is OE quality and fit as well. All in all I am very happy with the hitch and wiring kit. Especially given the savings over OE or other brands of hitch kits.

Obviously a cheap setup. Bought it for temporary use as it is a fairly straight forward install and I don't know my cars platform yet. Doesn't pull oil from the air completely but it is ok. I don't believe it is baffled. No brackets included, had to make my own. If it came with a bracket I'd give 5 stars. Color is holding up, I used different hosing. I believe it was 3/8 braided hot water heater hose from Home Depot. $1 a foot or something. Picture doesn't show the product but you can see the before and after lines. It works a little.

Based upon another reviewer's opinion, I bought these to replace the "JDM Astar 800 Lumens Super Bright AX-2835 Chipsets" tail lamps I purchased last year.  As the other reviewer stated, other LEDs, including the other JDM brand LEDs I own, don't have a large distinction between the running light and brake light.  He used a 10 point scale to rate them which I believe worked very well.  I'd rate them this way in regard to brightness:  Running Light  Brake LightOEM:  5  10JDM Astar 800:  6  8JDM Astar Extremely Bright:  6  10Of course, my numbers aren't scientific.  However, I hope they provide some measure of clarity if you're trying to determine if these are worth trying.  Assuming they turn out to be reliable, I'm very satisfied.  If the company is reading, even brighter brake lights would be a plus but I'm certainly not complaining.  I have included photos showing the two LEDs mentioned here in comparison (the left side is the "Extremely Bright" LED, the right side is the "800 Lumen" LED).  If you look closely, you'll even notice that the brake light is reflected off of the shrub next to my garage door opening (which further demonstrates just how bright these lights are).

I now own a couple of tractors. My first tractor I bought a pair of 20" super lug tires. I have had nothing but amazing performance from them since the day I got them. So, I decided to replace those old turf savers on my other tractor with a pair of these again. These are very similar to those AG tires found on farm tractors. They have a deep tread in them that allow them to grip the ground. It literally bites into mud, water, soft sand, or even wet grass on a hill, and will plow you right through it with ease.I have been very impressed by these. Usually these tires are very expensive too, I was able to get them off Amazon for an affordable price. And if that aint good enough for you, I elected for the super saver ground shipping option and I received my tires in two days! Best shipping in the world! I love Amazon and their products, that is why I always come back. Its experiences like this that make me want to keep coming back. Those turf savers arn't doing it for you, get a pair of super lugs!

This fit my 2018 short bed F150 perfectly and was simple to install.  No tools needed. Looks great and creates a nice seal.  The quality of the frame is solid and the vinyl is tight.  Have not taken on the highway yet to check for noise but doing 50 it is silent.  It is simple to open and close with the light weight frame.  No issues opening and closing the tailgate with the topper down.  This is a great product at a reasonable  cost.  Wish it was made in USA and not China.

installed.....bright?  Hell yes...no doubt.Crisp white/blue tint light?  HELL NO! You can see by the pics below.Make sure your headlight housing & wiring can withstand the extra heat generated by these 100 watt monsters... This is my second pair of 100 watt halogens I've bought to try and match the main outside headlights which are 6000k led's. Not even close. Nice price tho if you're just looking for more light and don't forget about heat generated...  If you have to run these long periods of time make sure your electrical system can handle the extra power draw.

Bought the all-black lugs. Work great with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Focal-428SB-F-04-Matte-Black-Wheel-17x7-5-34-5x100mm-42-mm-offset/dp/B00C5THKDY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Focal 428SB F-04 Matte Black Wheel (17x7.5"/5x100mm, +42 mm offset)</a>.It's worth mentioning that the "key" obviously fits the lugs perfectly, but is designed to fit inside the lug wrench that comes with your vehicle (which makes sense, especially for removing or "breaking" them for removal). What this means though, if you want to use a torque wrench to tighten them onto your car (which, you know, you should, otherwise you may under-tighten them, have a couple back off completely and your wheel could fall off, or more likely, overtighten them and have the bolts snap, especially when it's cold, which is a REAL PAIN to fix), is that you need a socket the size of a standard lug nut within which the "key" will fit, because there is no receiver-hole in the "key" that would otherwise fit a standard torque wrench. There's no hole at all through the key. Hope that helps.No issues with the coating scraping / scratching off. I just didn't scrape them on the ground, slipped them straight into the "key", and put them on the car. Probably just don't scrape them on something right? It's just a coating, you know, like the paint on your car, or your house... Don't scrape it, and it won't scrape-off.

I have a 2007 GSXR 1000.This thing sucks....the instructions are horrible, you don't know if your putting it on upside down or the wrong way round at all. The installation consists of trial and error, one would think this would be a breeze to put on but you would be wrong. The main problem is the bracket slips over the stock subframe bolts, unfortunately the bolts have about 1-2 threads that you have to get a nut on and tighten. Once you get the nut on and try to ratchet it down the force pops the nut off before enough thread is on to prevent it from coming off. Also the holes for the subframe bolts don't match up so you have to drill the holes on the bracket wider to get it to slip onto the bolts.This took me about two hours to put on and I had to drill the bracket and only 1 bolt has a nut on it. Granted its tight as hell and hopefully won't make a difference but still.If you don't believe me look at your bike right before the seat shock and locate the two bolts, you'll notice that they are essentially flush and have the subframe bent up around them, then take a look at the bracket it's flat so how are you suppose to get a flat bracket over two bolts that have the frame surrounding them??? Poor design period the bracket holes should be bent at a step angle in order to have enough thread come through to properly screw it up.I'm going to try and add pictures so people can see what I'm talking about.

This little bag is a lot roomier than it looks. Its nice not having to wear a backpack to carry stuff when I go out to run errands. I can fit a thick medium sized textile jacket with elbow and shoulder pads and a back protector in this bag, and there's enough space left over to put my gloves in the little net compartment. So when I go somewhere I just throw my helmet on the helmet hook under the seat and throw my gloves and jacket in the bag. Overall it feels very nicely put together and it has enough space for my needs. It is well worth the money.

The best cruiser helmet on the market.  In fact I got one last week from the Honda shop- the new model and this one is better than the new versions.  This one is a bit lighter and has air vents in the back.  I love it.  My wife has the same head size so I gave her the other one.  The visor is great as well- it is smoked not clear.  I rode to work this morning and had no trouble seeing with it down.  I ride with it 3/4 of the way down as it does come a bit close to the nose.  I have a windshield on my bike so - yeah I can do that.  Great helmet- great price- I would recommend this one to anyone on a cruiser.

Installed on a 2015 Subaru XV Crosstrek with perfect results. It stays tucked up out of the way from being hit by anything and the spring-loaded valve lever has to be pressed AND moved in order to open the valve. I installed a tight-fitting valve cap for extra insurance, but I strongly doubt anything can make this valve fail under normal use. Build quality is top notch, and convenience of being able to control the drain flow is priceless. I'm able to drain the oil into quart containers if I wish for easy disposal, or take a sample for an oil analysis easily. This valve pays for itself since I no longer have to purchase the crush washers for each oil change.

These light up the interior of the car. I had originally replaced the pathetic OEM tungsten bulbs with some cheaper LED bulbs that were white, but not very bright. See my photo and compare those other LED bulbs with these ones.  The JDM ASTAR LED bulb is on the left side in my photo and noticeably brighter. I wouldn't use these as a license plate light because they are so bright, but for interior lighting they are perfect if you want to light up the car.

Measuring tire thread made easy. I found the other manual tire thread depth measuring tools online sometimes made a mess -- as they were lubricated to keep the up & down measuring friction -- and felt I should give the digital route a try. Am glad I did. The reading is big & very legible & It really helps when taking photos for online commerce in order for possible buyers to feel more confident in the tire they are getting.I personally don't use the pressure reading piece as I have another gadget for that but it's nice to know it's there if I need it. The manual says the battery should last 3-4yrs. Time will tell if that's try but I am glad it's easily replaceable by the user.

I used these KYB KG54317 shocks with 4x4 Moog 81041 rear springs and paired them with the FCS 1336341L and 1336341R Complete Struts sold here on Amazon to give my 98 2WD 4runner a little lift. So far this combination rides great crawling the bombed out streets of New Orleans.

Do I use these inside the car no? Do I use them for long periods of time outside of the vehicle yes.I currently have a set of 3258 on my jeep for rock lights that I leave on for hours, they go through the car wash 2-3 times a month, they are covered by some mud. and i have not had a single one go out.On to the 5050s these will replace the 3258s here shortly and they are lot brighter then the 3258s, now something I did with the 5050s that I didn't do with the others is submerge them with no waterproofing done. and they work flawlessly, the 3M pad provides plenty area to stick and lasts.

This went on pretty smooth especially considering that I have ever done anything like this before. I really ended up enjoying doing this myself. The instructions were ok but it definitely helped to have the you tube video loaded on my phone:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JycmxpounEIt helped I think to have another person help me install it. The end result was about 4 1/2 inches rather than 3 inches. I understand that this is done because the manufacturer is expecting other equipment that will weigh the jeep down and bring it down to 3 inches. I was able to fit my 35s without any issues. The ride quality definitely improved and was noticed by everyone who had taken a ride in my jeep pre-lift.

I bought these bars to replace the horrible stock bars.  I initially tapped the pin underneath the stock bars and rolled the forward.  That helped but the pull back of the stock bars was too much and uncomfortable.  I installed these bars on my '16 Road Glide Special.  Road 6 has an very good install video on their website.  I watched that twice before installing the bars and had no issues.  It took about two hours.  The '16s are easier because Harley got rid of the green throttle wire connector and the six-pin connector was reduced in size so there was no need to unpin that connector to fit the wires through the bars.  The finish on the bars is excellent and they look great on the bike.  More importantly, they are very comfortable.

Garbage. Once you get the LEDs just throw them away. That way they will serve you better. Flickers when the light is on. Half of the LEDs glow and the other ones glow whenever they feel like turning on.

I wasn't looking for anything to haul a huge load and just needed to replace an old rusted out bumper. This was easy to install and only required one additional hole to be drilled in each bracket for proper fitment (see the photos I added) which, for a product sold as universal, is pretty good.Shipping was super fast and installation with the Westin 66000 Fey Diamond Step Black Rear Utility Bumper was a breeze.This was installed on a 1996 Nissan Pick Up (Hard Body).

A decent regulator replacement. It's not genuine BMW of course, but it's quality enough, and came pre-greased for the job. It's worth noting again that this does not come with a motor (as specified). That's alright though. The motor's attached to the old regulator with three Torx T30 screws and is super easy to swap.It also came with replacement clips and screws to mount the glass, with hilariously brief directions (see image): "pls use the glass clips and screws to replace the old one". Not quite confidence inspiring, but I don't judge.Anywho, it fits just fine in my 1999 328i, works smoothly and quietly, and after 30 minutes hasn't broken yet. Aftermarket regulators are infamous for self-destructing within months, so I'll keep this updated.UPDATE: Hello! 8 months later and it's still working fine. No grinding, no noises, no problems. In fact, a week ago my righthand regulator went kaput too, and this replacement worked so well I bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/righthand-version/dp/B00P2VXOUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">righthand version</a>&nbsp;to replace it. That one works fine too. Eight months isn't a whole lot of time I'll grant you, for for 30 bucks, hey, I'll take it.

I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about, the bolts that came with it were more than long enough, almost too long actually!  Pretty easy install really.  Was super stiff the first few hundred miles but has softened up now and rides great.  Combined with a 2 inch shackle drop and these add a leafs you get a cheap functional lift for the back end!

For the money you can't really complain... it does what its supposed to, decent size, and doesn't look super generic. However, somehow water gets in around the Philip head screws and leaks rust water all over the place. Now this can be resolved with some patience and some silicone, which should be included with these type of racks because they all do this. I've owned other comparable brand racks and have always had issues where the 2 pieces join together, but never from the bolt holes. I'm thinking the little rubber seals provided with the screws is what is causing this issue. I don't believe the other brands used seals. Mine was also a warehouse deal so saved a nice little chunk of money and all it had was a tiny scratch.

You simply won't find a better product and better service. I wasn't sure if I needed the Canbus version of the lights, so I ordered the wrong item number. Turns out I mis-ordered. I contacted the seller to see what module I needed to re-order to make these compatible with my Dodge Ram pickup - and they put them in the mail at no charge!  Now that's serious customer service. I have since purchased all my other LEDs from JDM Astar for our truck and camper trailer, and am totally pleased with every item.  See the attached photo for the difference in LUX between the stock incandescent and the new LEDs. To see how they installed: [...]

I had recently purchased these when I wanted to touch up my vehicle's interior.  The lights are nearly invisible in daylight but very vibrant (and not blinding) at night.  There are several different light configurations (it mostly blinks through a few colors and repeats) but I am a fan of the original blue.  It also has a feature to synch with the music (I have not used it).  The wires that attach to the main unit are long enough that you have room to work with them and small enough to tuck under vehicle trim.  The lights themselves are solid enough and their wires are durable.  Above all, it is reasonably priced (though it may be more costly if you have someone install it for you).Though it comes with some ties for mounting, I recommend 3m double sided tape (since not all car interiors are accommodating for the ties).Here are some pictures of the lights inside a low light garage.  The wires are visible until the new floor mats arrive.

This Trunk Organizer is one of the best things ever for your car. I have so many things always flying around my back seats and trunk and now they are all in one place and organized. I had umbrella's, reusable grocery bags, bottles of water, first aid kit and more. Now they are all in my organizer and my car is so much cleaner.This also works great after a small trip to the grocery store. Nothing is more frustrating then putting bags of your groceries in your car, only to get home and find some of them rolling around the back of your car because the bags fell over and groceries fell out. Now I can set the bags in my organizer.The size is nice and large measuring at approx. 23" x 14" x 12 1/2". Folds down flat if you don't want it open all the time too. There is a mesh pocket on the side too for bottles and such. The quality is awesome. It's nice and sturdy and very well made. There are plastic hooks to hook it closed and you can also just have 1 side open if you don't need it as large. Definitely loving this and very happy with it.**I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.

Looks good and comes with the bulbs as well which I didn't expect.  I would have given this 5 stars but NO SCREWS ARE INCLUDED in the package to attach the unit or the cover so I had to reuse the old ones, which are slightly too short as the new cover doesn't have a recess for the screws like he OEM lights did, meaning they aren't going to screw in as deep. I think at least two screws wouldn't thread, I may stop by Home Depot to find longer ones. Makes me wonder what else they cut costs on to save a few Yuan.  I guess I'll see how it lasts and will know soon.

Product desription was very vague. Bought it hoping it was what I wanted, it was even better. This is for a 2" ball coupler, just what I needed. It is a class 3, which makes it beefy, and it is! It comes assembled, It comes drop shipped from CURT, and in pretty good time. Price was SUPER, Less than 5 bucks delivered, how is that even possible............This latch stud was a little bigger than the one I replaced so I had to file out the slot in the coupler a little, 2 minutes worth of my time. I will upload a pic. Product description says made in USA, please note pic. Also does not weigh 7 pounds, 2 or 3 maybe.

For the price, I can't complain much. You get what you pay for though. The glasses them selves aren't bad but whoever put the foam on the insides i think was blind. The foam is wrinkled and indented and not straight. I can feel the sticky at the top and bottom of every pair. The first time I ride through some dust ordirt on the highway I imagine it's going to stick to the glasses. I will use these until I can't anymore, but I will not purchase them again.

Not all motor oils are created equal. This stuff is hard to find but is miles beyond the dealership gunk, and cheaper if you do it yourself. Car runs noticeably smoother and doesn't break down as quickly as other synthetics. I even saw a slight mpg bump; only 2 avg mpg but hey, when premium gas is required, I'll take it.

Decided to take the gamble and see if this would work good. Although I've never had a foam cannon before I am super happy I purchased this.

Track bar is very solid and centered my front axle after a 3 inch suspension lift. The track bar doesn't come with any instructions, just the bar and two sleeves that go on the frame end. Installation was very simple. It took me two tries to get the axle centered within an 1/8th of an inch. I may take it a part again to get it perfect, but it is fine for now. This is the cheapest adjustable track bar I have come across and it works great!

the muffler was actually red, not black, but still ended up working with my terrible spray paint job lol the bracketry was kind of useless, made my own use spacers from the original OEM muffler moving the lower bolt to the middle location.  I have a Wildfire 150cc and it fits relatively well and is secure.  it sounds like a 250cc ATV now with a deeper louder tone.  it is a straight through glass pack style muffler.  could be excitement but feels like it has more grunt in the mid range.  slight modification but overall happy.

I bought these for my enclosed car hauler trailer. I wanted to have the lowest draw on the batteries running the trailer and because of the decent reviews and good price I bought these.So far they are great. They put out slightly less light than the standard bulbs I was using but that's to be expected. I really like the blueish light they put out.

I've only been riding with this product installed for a little over 2 weeks now, so far it seems to be holding up great. I ride around up to an hour almost every day on my 2003 Triumph America. The seat design on the Triumph really hugs your bum so on the really hot days we had ~90+F this product literally makes you feel a breeze on your hind end. The beads also help with blood circulation in my opinion because its not a flat surface and it also allows you to scoot around a bit easier with your bum not sticking to the leather, thus preventing your bum from going numb. It's awesome. It seems to be made of really thick and high quality fishing line string. We'll see how long it holds up though

I felt bad for the delivery driver that had to deliver this thing... it is heavy!  Seems extremely well built, you will not be disappointed in build quality.I installed it on a '99 Ford F-350. Installation requires 3/4", 15mm and 18mm sockets, and a 5/8" drill bit (a step bit works well here). I'd also recommend a hole punch and small drill bit to drill a pilot hole. If you have an impact wrench it will really help, otherwise you will likely need a 2-3' breaker bar to loosen the bumper and tow hook bolts that have likely never been removed before.  I had to use Kroil in addition to a large 3/4" impact wrench to break the bolts free on the tow hooks, so have some Kroil or other penetrating oil handy and maybe give the bolts a squirt an hour or two before you tackle this.Instructions were included, pretty straight forward once you get started. You do need to drill four holes on the back bumper brackets, then basically reassemble. Think about how you will attach your front license plate as the new front receiver will likely be where your license plate used to be.  They make 2" receiver hitch license plate holders that slide in which could be a good solution for that.I took away one star because the rectangular thick reenforcing washers on the back side of the bumper mount had to be modified. One per side had to have a corned cut off with a cutting wheel to sit flush.Overall install time took me about 2 hours, a fairly easy job if you are handy.

I love the way they look on the truck and like the fact that the are one piece aluminum with no endcaps to lose. At 5'11" and 275 they support my weight with no problems. Took me about 1.5 hours to install myself while laying on the ground. I bolted everything loosely, adjusted the brackets and bracket supports individually and tightened them as i went along.  I agree with other reviewers that the bolts should be painted black as you can notice the gold and silver colored bolts and nuts. Minor thing, but tomorrow I'll be underneath the truck spraying everything black.

These gauges are pretty accurate for what they cost.  The temperature gauge was exactly right, testing against a known calibrated thermometer.  The oil pressure gauge sticks slightly for the first 5 psi or so, but hardly noticeable.  The voltage was off by .3volts low.  14.1 volts actual measured 13.8 volts.****EDIT****After more than 3 months, I just wanted to say I still like these gauges.  They are working fine as reported earlier and now that I've been able to check them out after dark, the lights are just right for night driving.  Enough to see the needle position and tell that things are working right.  Any brighter and they would be a distraction.  Don't bother wiring the lights through your dash dimmer switch though.  You will want them full bright and if your dash is dimmed at all, they won't be bright enough.I've very happy with this purchase.

I was a little nervous that installation would be labor intensive but it turned out to be quite simple. I scrubbed all the bugs off my grill, thoroughly cleaned it with rubbing alcohol, and put the snaps on per the directions. I did use my wife for an extra set of hands to make sure I didn't pull it off center and it went on in about 3 minutes.Now I haven't road tested it but my initial impression is good for this. I'have several camping trips planned in the coming weeks so I'll update my review with road notes. Out of the box, A+

Wow... what a difference.  I just hit 100k miles.  I replaced all 4 disks and pads.  The old disks must have been warped because an annoying shake at higher speeds has gone away.... even with my tires that are nearing end of life.  My truck stops better than I can remember it stopping for the last several years.  Smooth and tight.  These disks are sourced from China... so set that expectation.  Over 3000 miles now and they are still doing great.Installed with 17D792CH and 17D785CH ceramic pads.

This muffler is heavy and very solid. You can tell it's quality stuff. Now I had this installed for about 59 bucks at a muffler auto shop. I talked to the muffler guy before buying this and he told me he recommends the Magnaflow over Flowmaster for small cars like Civics with 4 cylinder engine. He said Flowmaster is better for sports cars and cars with bigger engine. He did inform me that most customers likes the sound better without the resonator. I had it installed with the resonator inside and it sounded awesome when I turned on the engine and reved it in the shop. When I left the place and drove for an hour I realized it's very quiet but it does sound a tiny bit better than stock. You can start to hear the muffler better when you drive 50+mph on the freeway. I'm gonna drive it for couple more days and see if I should keep the resonator in or not.Pros:Looks goodGood PriceQuality ItemPreferred by guys that work at muffler shops because mufflers with tip is easier to install and faster than ones that come separate with the tipI can't really give any con's because my car is a 4 cylinder. Now if I had a Corvette or Mustang and it sounded dead silent like my Civic, I'd be disappointed. Thing to keep in mind is that these are universal mufflers so some mods may need to be made to fit this bad boy under your car. Another thing to keep in mind is that it may not stick out of your car. Mine under the bumper and you cant see it from the side. If you're buying this not only for the sound but to show off, I'd skip it and buy the exhaust and tip because these muffler's with built in tip have a limit to how far it can stick out of your car depending on your bumper.Anyone take off the resonator? Do you like it?UPDATE 3/27:I've had this muffler on my Civic Em2 for over a week now. The muffler does sound a little louder now as I've drove enough for the muffler to break in. It's a Civic so I don't expect it to sound like one of those street cars. I bought this to add a bit of style and sound. If you don't expect race car sound you'll notice the difference in sound from the dead silent stock exhaust. I wish my civic was a SI so I could enjoy this muffler even more but I'm still happy with this on my dead silent Civic em2. Adding ram intake, header, and catback would improve sound but thats way out of my budget.

This is a great item for such a reasonable price!  It is very large and fits the key fob for my 2015 Lexus IS 250 with the OEM leather key fob cover still on it, so I'd imagine this would hold pretty much any year or model key fob.  It is probably much too bulky for a man to use if carrying keys in his pocket, but for women this thing is superb as it makes finding keys at the bottom of a large handbag SO much easier.  There is no missing this case. I have taken a photo of it next to an iPhone 6 for sizing comparison.  Looks just like the photo, good quality, strong zipper and clip. The Lexus "L" logo is excellent, the word Lexus is a little wonky but not enough for me to care at this price point.  Would definitely recommend it despite the less than perfect logo stamp, it's almost perfect and not a genuine Lexus manufactured item which would cost at least 3-5x as much.

First off, I live in the PNW and it rains a lot so our car usually smells like a wet dog and there's always moisture. This summer though has been a mix of rain and sunshine and amidst the moisture and wet dog smell, there's also the smell of spilled drink or food that often starts smelling before I can clean it up, thanks to my 3 messy kids. So I was super excited to try this.The pros are that it's all natural and made from bamboo and charcoal, it's odorless, it's well made and my fave color: green! But it's really big, and even though it comes with a strap and clip, I don't have anywhere to hang it. I can't really tell if it is working either. It had rained the other day and I did notice that my car didn't smell like a wet dog, so I think it definitely helped. We are also a mill town so there's always a nasty scent coming through my vents. I wish it had like a natural scent so I could find a way to hang it in front of my vents and blow a fresh scent into the car. Only time will tell if it really works but I like the idea of having something natural in my car.I did get to try this free but these are my own opinions.

Im gonna give these LED's a 5 star only because if you use them in the right application they are perfect.They are to be used as high/ low beams only to be effective....not as your main beams if you have projectors. I will go farther in explaining....I own a 2014 Hyundai Sonata which has 2 settings for the lights:1) daytime running lights (high/low beams which don't throw out many watts to effectively juice these puppies up)2) Main beam lights which are projectors (for some reason they don't like projector headlight housing at all and are not as bright as a pair of 7000lm @6000k which i run for my main beams.NOW.... running them in the daytime running light housing they are effective as far as looks during the day and when at night and you need to put the brights on. You will be surprised how bright these puppies are. I mean blind the crap out of somebody !!!! Mind you that housing isn't projectors.Also these LED's are massive and square and will not fit for the Hyundai's main or daytime running housing, the clips will not hold them down because of the design! If the heat sink/fan was round then it could work!Another thing i recieved these packaged well but when unboxing and pulling them out to inspect them. The glass housing that incases the led's was cracked and missing some glass in the bottom half of the led housing , which the glass is paper thin so be careful when installing!!! I didn't mind that so much cause it's pretty much just a barrier. My other led's are open and do just fine in the weather!So just to reiterate don't use these in projector headlights cause you will be disappointed. And i can't comment on how bright they would be in main beam non projector headlight housing. But im sure they would be bright as hell ! Because the brights are extremely bright !!!!! So that is why i am giving these a five star rating.Also these are more on the 6500k to 7000k side than 6000k. They do have a small but noticeable blue tint to them if your comparing them next to a true 6000k led.If the seller is looking at this maybe they can give me a refund of some sorts cause im sure they didn't know they wouldn't fit.I'll update if anything comes of that !!!UPDATE: LEDKINGDOM has contacted me and is sending me another set with no hassle!5 stars for customer service and company relations!!!

The Standard is the right width for a 2015 VW Golf, but its about 6" too short for the vertical distance.  Rather that deal with the hassle of sending it back, I'm going to just keep and use it for the season.  It's better than nothing, and does cover about 80% of the windshield (although the wiper area is the most important part of the glass).See photo

So I bought these was very skeptical in buying them as they are cheap. Got them very quickly, looked nice in a box took em out they were all there. So broke em out and installed them fairly simple, just wish they were marked for which window they go on. Other then that looks good and does the job. Best of luck

Perfect fit for 2001 Odyssey!  Easy installation.  Once interior door panel has been removed it required the simple removal of 9 10mm bolts holding the window regulator/motor, guide rail, and glass to remove the old and install the new. Unit came with written instructions but I would highly recommend watching Youtube video (there are several) to see how easy it is to remove & replace.  Quality of unit looks as good as the OEM.  Only time will tell if this holds true.Adding photos. The unit on left is obviously the broken unit.  4th photo is of door with mounting screw locations identified. The green circled are to the 2 screws supporting the glass.  To access requires bottom of glass be pushed up to the holes so the screws are visible. This is easily done as glass was not that heavy and everything slide easily.

These are a must have if you don't want to crimp your brake hoses while doing you brakes. I've been using bungee cords for over 25 years and their junk compaired to this method... I wish that I had stumbled across these a long time ago.

I only use Meguiar's products because in my opinion they are the best. I just finished cleaning my truck using their compound, polisher and ultimate liquid wax and I love the way my truck looks. I only wish I had known a shower was going to come through tonight but at least I know it beats up great.

They put out a mild light, not particularly bright.  The wire is very short, and there is NO 3m tape on the bottom, it says 3m on it, but it is just a light adhesive/ no tape (real 3m Tape costs as much as these lights).  They are Great for the cheap led install such as under the dash or on a bicycle, but I would not recommend these for under the car use, or other uses that might splash the light with water.

I've put over 10,000 miles on mine, no issues. They're good for keeping wind and rain off my hands.To get them to stop rattling, I  used a couple of 5/16" Danco 80352 Tank Bolt Washers washers on each bar end(two each side).

Product is great. I used 2 cans of plastidip and 1.5 cans of metalizer. Put it on 18" wheels and did not skimp. Looks really great. Even when dried and cured, the surface has a tacky feel that attracts dirt and brake dust like a magnet. But they look awesome when they are clean. Very easy to use.

I install these today in my 2016 Ford Focus for my front and rear dome lamps. The little plastic dome on the tip of the bulb makes them too long to fit into the dome assembly or the floorboard courtesy assembly. I used an exacto knife to carefully cut the plastic dome off of the bulb and they fit perfectly into the assembly. This also made the bulbs seem a bit brighter. Looks really great in a black interior and the car is also red so as you can tell I'm going for a theme here lol. Very happy with this purchase!

This phone mount is most definitely better than nothing, but I'm afraid the positives end there. If you're planning on using this to record dash video, you can stop right here and look elsewhere. As other reviewers have noted, this thing shakes like crazy - I have a feeling that's mostly due to the mounting location and the fact that Jeeps are just shaky in general (shakier than, say, a Honda Civic anyway). I mainly just use it for GPS and notifications, which it's fine for (the shaking isn't enough to get in the way of that). I took off a star off because, as other reviewers have said, this thing WILL scratch your dash, even if you're careful. I had considered trying to put some adhesive-backed felt on the contact point between the clamp and the dash, but the fit is so tight it probably wouldn't have room. I took off another star because the included tray is hard plastic (read: garbage) that doesn't properly seat all the way down in my 2012 JK. This thing is overpriced by about $15, for sure.Something else you should be aware of is that if you have an aftermarket head unit and have removed the OEM metal bracket from behind the factory stereo, you're going to need a short bolt with 2 washers and a nut in order to properly secure this to the dash. I ended up having to shave a bolt I bought at Home Depot in order for it to have clearance to fit between my double DIN head unit and the dash.

Nice light bar for the money.  $75 plus shipping for a 50" curved light bar.  It took a bit to get the correct brackets in final form but she us up and provides plenty of extra light.  I mounted this on the front of a 2017 Polaris Ranger.  The second pic is at dusk in competition with a street light.  That is about 75 yards out.  Plenty of light.

Great addition if you're looking to perk up an older engine or to give your new engine extra ponies.Pros: Very easy to install, you can truly feel a horsepower improvement, helps to improve throttle response, great written instructions with step by step photos, fantastic step by step video instructions on K&N's website, only 90 min install, top notch customer service, you get to remove 15lbs of complicated plastic and replaced it with 3lbs of simple straight pipe tubing and a ginormous filter, vortex sound when you accelerate hard (personal preference), military discount if ordered direct from K&NCons: Pricey for some plastic tubing and a big air filter... but still worth it, pay close attention to the bolt diagram, it can be easy to mix up which bolts go where and it doesn't help that they give you extra hardware (the extra hardware is needed for some of the  year models)Notes:K&N Does NOT make ANY claims to improved gas mileage.While you have the throttle body off it's a good idea to clean it (if needed) with some carb cleaner. Carbon tends to build up around the edge of the butterfly valve and can degrade throttle response and cause the computer to make your truck run rich at idle. It only takes two minutes and you've already done the hard work by removing the throttle body... just a thought.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Gumout-800002231-Carb-and-Choke-Cleaner-Jet-Spray-14-oz/dp/B005LD2GLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Gumout 800002231 Carb and Choke Cleaner Jet Spray - 14 oz.</a>

Bearly had a couple months and already broke some how and u can see how cheap these plastic crystals are that are bonded to it. Look and feel cheap and are gigantic compared to normal size ones. Bout the size of a quarter and the gem in the middle looks like something out of a quarter machine. They are metal but super thing and feel like plastic. I think I heard one crack as I was tightening it. These would be totally cool with less plastic gems and if they were smaller

Yorkim lights are bright and they look much cleaner looking and packaging is super nice but that's where it ends. These lights start flickering with in a month. I've gotten dirt cheap LEDs that last 3 to 5 months before flickering. These should NOT be an option for LEDs. I've had a lot over time and I can say go to your local auto store and get the Philips LEDs the reliability is much better and worth your dollar!

Quality product with just enough tooth to remove oxidation from RV electrostatically painted aluminum sides as well as Gelcoat covered fiberglass.  Electrostatically painted aluminum generally only has 10mil of paint. Heavy oxidation can mean that you could lose half of that thickness if you use the wrong product.If you look at the picture I submitted, the spot to the right of the door has not yet been compounded. The left has.Meguires is second to none in my book.

Absolutely love this product! The shipping was a few days faster then it was expected which i was very happy when i recieved it ahead of time. The product is exactly how it was advertised. Instructions for wiring and turning the different modes on and off are precise and accurate. When mounting it takes a good five or ten minutes to mount this product in the fairing but not because of any faults of the taillight itself... i took the extra time to make the light flush with the fairing around the edges to make it look very professional. This light is very bright and the difference between the running light and the brake lighting are great... some products don't get much brighter when the brake is applied but this product does a fantastic job. The running light is very bright as is but when the brake is applied is gets 2x brighter very visible difference. I was unable to use the sequential blinker mode because i do not have resistors on my flush mount blinkers in the front and it makes the blinker rate too fast for the sequential to work its way from the center to the outside of the light. Product does state to start install with factory blinker rate which i did not but i can easily add resistors to the front blinkers to allow me to use the sequential blinker mode as to the regular mode. All in all i am very pleased with this product it was a great buy i have no doubts that you will be pleased with this product as well.  *ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT I WILL BE SURE AND ANSWER WITH DETAIL*

Installed these in front differential of 1999 Ford F250 super duty built after 3/22/1999. What a job, with few tools and in the drive way. Make sure you have good jack stands and properly placed. And before going under the vehicle, try to shake the truck off of the jack stands. It would be better for it to come off before rather than during. Also, these seals do not have a seat. You can drive these straight through where they are suppose to be and into the axle, or the differential, depending on which way you drive them. I used a 2" rigid coupling from a piece of electricians conduit. It fit the outer part of the seal, but would not pass into the area where the seal was to be. O.D. 2&5/8". This with a piece of 3/8" althread and I was able pull the seal into place from the outer knuckle.

NO!  They DO NOT fit your standard 5 gallon bucket that is sold at the big box stores.  Just because they go inside does not mean they fit as they were designed to.  They stop 4 inches from the bottom of the largest 5 gal bucket at Lowes.  We all believe they will be resting on the bottom of the bucket when we buy these Grit Guards.I cut off  1 outer ring and filed down the sharp plastic edges and now mine fit to the bottom of my 5 Gal buckets.  They are 10.5 inches as advertised...so if you don't want to trim these to make them fit..make sure your bucket at the bottom is a little bigger than 10.5 inches.

Why edelbrock don't include this with their carbs when you buy it? I've had hard restarting issues after the motor got hot on my edelbrock 1406 600cfm. The carb would get hot and boil the fuel out. I read about this heat insulator and ordered it. Install was simple. Kit came with longer studs. Used the old gasket between the insulator and carb. No leaks, no issues with hood hitting the aircleaner wingnut. Best of all, after getting the motor hot, I turned off the motor waited 5 min. It restarted with no prob. Problem solved.

Love this stuff.  Use it as a drying aid after every wash.  You'll get at least 2 weeks worth of durability out of it, beading is insane, application couldn't be easier and protection is very good for a spray wax.

These are great triangles. Super visible and reflective. The case is not heavy duty enough for them in my opinion, latches are thin. For keeping them while in your trunk it has been fine so far for me. They are easy to use, set up, take down. Instructions are poor, they are molded on the inside lid of the case. I would not want to have to read them in the dark. I cut up the label and taped it on the top of the case since it is not well marked and the instructions are lacking. I have needed them and not had them. Road flares only last about 10-15min(been there done that). I had to use my triangles the other day and am glad I had it. Compared to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/AAA-4342AAA-Emergency-Warning-Triangle/dp/B002SIR8RU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AAA 4342AAA Emergency Warning Triangle</a>&nbsp;which was my first triangle but a bit more expensive at about eighteen dollars each with no case. the AAA has a white sticker on it in the pictures.Over all I would recommend these triangles, especially considering I bought them twice for 2 different vehicles.

Pretty cool.  Just installed a generator in Michigan and needed something to store more fuel.  Mounted it on the wall and out of the way so it can fill all the power toys, and high enough so I can fill the lawn tractor.  The main purpose is for the generator, so I put 5oz of StaBil in it, then filled with 14 gallons of ethanol-free fuel.  Just filled it today (2/3/17) with 14 gallons and would recommend 13.5 gallons or so.  14 puts the level just above the bottom of the fill cap.  Not a big deal in the winter, but in the summer I suspect the pressure will push the level higher, and I don't want to find out the hard way if the fill cap leaks at some point.Having almost three 5-gallon gas cans worth of gas hanging on the wall and out of the way seems like a good idea in theory.  I will post updates if I have any issues, but I still kinda laugh when I walk out in the garage and see a gas pump hanging on the wall.

I drive a Chrysler Town and Country van and found this sunshade was too small for the large windshield.  I attempted a couple of angles but it did not fit at all.  Too small.  I took the shade over to a neighbor and we went through the process with her car and it fit perfectly.  She has previously used accordion style sunshades and they drove her crazy.  The wire frame on this one helps keep the shade in shape and we just needed to pull the sun visors down which kept it in place.  The wire frame is only around the 2 circles not the entire sunshade.  Loose fabric fills in to make the entire shade square.  The reflective side didn't totally keep the heat out of the car but it helped.  We live in Florida so keeping heat out of the vehicles is important.  The fabric is nicer than the crinkle aluminum type sunshades.  It takes a little figuring out how to fold it back up but it was not hard, just follow the instruction sheet.  The elastic band to help keep the shade folded was a nice touch, then just slide the entire thing into the fabric case.  It folded up into a small size which allowed it to be stored in the side compartment of the driver side door.  We gave this 4 stars not 5 because it didn't fit the larger vehicle windshield.  BUT it did fit the car perfectly.I received this item at no cost so I could provide an honest review.

Like other reviews this item came a little scratched but the box was not damaged.  The scratches are due to items rubbing together inside the box (see scratch photo) and not being packaged properly.  The cargo carrier seems well made otherwise.  It took me about 20 minutes with hand tools to put it together.  I would recommend this carrier but keep in mind that this item will most likely have a few scratches on it when it arrives.

Great for a Grom with Pro Taper Honda Mini 7/8" bars. Look at my pictures. They do vibrate a lot but the Grom is buzzy anyway. They do droop on bumpy roads and the ball gets loose over time. Worth the $10 just to stay legal but if you commute, I suggest buying a sturdier fixed mirror that won't change position on its own.

Bought as replacement bulbs for our forest river 5th wheel.  Brighter than the bulbs that came with it and I am assuming they consume less energy.  I have not checked as we are plugged in most of the time.  One of the bulbs was very blackened missing its top and obviously burnt out when it arrived but I had extras and all the others I tried worked and are still working.  The light they put out is whiter than the bulbs that were in it but not so much that you would notice.  We are happy with them.

Purchased this item from the same supplier (just another site).  Consider myself pretty handy, but have always stayed away from auto wiring.  Remember someone burning up their car miswiring a radio back in the day.  My kit arrived.  I found a bunch of parts and a photocopied instruction packet.  Pulled out all the parts and spent about 30 minutes looking around the inside of my engine compartment.  Guess I had a little bit of an easier job since I own a Toyota Tacoma (exactly like the white one showed in the description).  But I really only used the photo to determine where to mount the light best and route the wires down the hood hinge.  Followed the instructions that said to mount the light first, then route the wire towards the power source.  Best to run your wires to the battery side.  Got the cable close to the battery and determined that I wanted to mount the switch there.  Didn't have the proper sized hole and had to drill another, no big deal.  Mounted the switch.  Split the wire down the middle, red to battery positive and black to switch negative.  Cut wires to proper lengths, allowing for some slack.  I used the included crimp connections and just wrapped them with e-tape.  Tucked wiring.  Used included zip ties to properly route the wire down the hood hinge (to prevent it from getting crushed).  Had to adjust the hood switch up to allow the hood to properly compress the switch (it really doesn't have to go down far to turn off the lights).  Took my time and was complete in a little more than an hour.  Actually had fun doing this project and it gave me some confidence to do more electrical work on my truck.  I'm sure anyone would have a similar easy experience on any car.  Considering installing this on my wife's pilot as well.  Don't hesitate.  Great product!!  Great price!!

Very pleased with this bag! I am using it on my 2003 Honda Valkyrie cruiser. Has 7 magnets on the bottom. I have already recommended this tank bag to my brother and will others too! Quality seems great! It does state in the instructions to make sure you do not drag the magnets across the tank and make sure your tank is at least wiped off before installing in order to not get scratching. That is a givin though! Of course, Magnets can mess up electronics. So don't put your screens right next to the magnets. That is a givin also... Love the bag! Buy it!

Couldn't pass up the price but once I received them I realized why they are enexpensive. The rubber seals on the sides of the clear lens were not seated properly possible exposing the internals to moisture. I took a light apart and noticed the side seals do not sit/lock in place securly thus during production it's allowing a misalignment of the seals. 3 out of 4 had this issue so i clear siliconed all 4. So far no issues on this 3rd day of rain.

I am very happy with this purchase. These aren't your run of the mill crappy door visors that stick so far out or look very cheap. This combines quality adhesive with a set track for maximum strength and durability. I also love how low profile these visors are. They allow me to have my window down a bit which helps with the subtropical climate here in Florida. They look amazing and add that extra touch of sportiness without coming close to looking over thought. I'd recommend this to anyone who has a Fit. Mine came with directions (but even if it didn't; it's super easy to find the directions online in .PDF format). I just had a custom auto place do the install for me. They put them on perfectly in less than 30 minutes and cost me less than half for the labor (compared to Dealership). My only complaint is that they do scratch rather easily. I'd be careful handling them.Conclusion: Buy them already!Happy Shopping!

This would probably be a good product for any other RZR than the model I have.  I have a 2018 1000XP Ride Command.  With the Ride Command, there are built in speakers in the doors and thus, these don't fit without modification. Right into the process, I emailed Jake at UTV who said that customers with my model generally make mods to make them fit...OK  I;ll make mods.  Three were just new holes for the screws to pass through but one had to be ground out and enlarged to allow an over size plastic "dimple" (for lack of a better word) to fit in.  Of course my meager shop doesn't have the grinder necessary and a trip to town to the hardware store was in order (50 miles round trip).  Then there is this plastic door mount screw that needs to be replaced... So far, one side is done and Im tempted to take it all apart, put it back in the box and send the whole darn thing back.

The spacers serve there purpose.. the bolts only catch 3 threads if your lucky. If your body is older it may only catch 1 or 2. This makes the bolts sort of work the first time you put them in, but it is highly unsafe, and the bolts end up stripping out due to the three threads not being enough to screw in tightly. Eventually you will get to the point where they turn.. turn.. than plop down.  very fustrating. Save yourself the time and head ache and go to an ace hardware and get a slightly .. very slightly thicker bolt, that is maybe 1/3 inch longer. I have seen others without complaints in the reviews.. so who knows maybe its just some xj model jeeps .. also, best bet for the oem studs coming from frame .. vice grips and lubricant.. GOOD LUCK! Wish my ace receipt said bolt size but it doesnt.. so cant help you there.

Installed these today and it was a snap. I plan on painting the Jeep black soon so these smoke corner lights and turn signal light sets will give the XJ a great "tactical" look. I ordered Sylvania amber LEDs for the turn signal and white LEDs for the side lights. I'm super happy with the results.

Bought this battery in October last year (2015), now August 31, 2016 the battery is dead and plastic warped and bulging on top. Guess I'll have to try another seller/manufacturer. I'll pursue warranty replacement since it was only installed and used for about 10 months and update my review accordingly, but I'm not going to hold my breath. At this time though, I can only say the battery was alright. I expected it to last longer, the OEM ones I've bought in the past seemed to last about 3-4 years a piece, this "approved replacement" turned out to be a dud. Proceed with caution when buying this battery, if I didn't catch the problem when I did, it looks like the battery could have exploded and burned my house down.

I switched from 100% dirt tires to this 50/50 Tire. It cost less than $100 for an entire set front and rear, and I paid $10 for three Tire spoons. Installed the tires myself and put balancing beads within the heavy duty tubes. I added counterbalance weights on my front and rear rims to cancel out the rim locks. These tires ride super smooth on the street and hook up when I need it off road and spin through a turn when I want them to. They have a more aggressive turning rate than my old Maxxis desert tires. I feel like I can drag knees with ease on these tires... And I absolutely can! I installed them and with less than 100 feet on and off road I was able to easily do wheelies in wet grass and On Pavement. Excellent tire for the value! In my experience when I install those Auto balancing beads I will get nearly double the mileage out of a tire. Stay tuned for my reported mileage! Best part is that both tires came shipped new. They were both made at the end of 2017 and I purchased in January 2018. Incredible value and excellent Tire!

Good price, color is just right.. it's not the weird blue color you'd get from another style/color bulb, it's a nice white.  I wouldn't say they are brighter, but it does light things differently and makes them stand out more vs that ugly yellow halogen color.These went in my 07 Jeep Commander very easy, and was a 2 minute install.. DON'T TOUCH THE GLASS PEOPLE!  (But you already knew that)

If you are not handy, do not buy. That being said, my parents needed a cheap radiator to replace theirs in a 2001 Town and Country with the 3.3L. In the pics, you'll see that I had to cut the bottom brace so it would accept the mounting bracket. It came with a new top bracket but not the bottom. And you can also see the difference between the original and this one. Also, the radiator came with a curve in it which made for major difficulty in lining up the bolt holes. Did not contact company for replacement as I needed to install then. All said, so far it has been holding pressure and was about the cheapest radiator for this vehicle here.

I've scuffed the paint a bit on my tailgate, anyone who uses their Jeep as more than a pavement princess has. This helps to protect your Jeep, and creates a tighter seal at the base of your hard top back window. The front piece creates a nice accent that also helps to deflect rocks and bugs while headed down the highway. Some of the early versions of the front piece only had one strip of adhesive to hold it down, but they've fixed the problem with things getting caught under the back/hood side by putting another strip of adhesive in.

I bought this filter for my 2001 VW Golf TDI.  I've used other brands but nothing is as good of quality as this Mann filter.  It fits perfect and is made in Germany.  I noticed a huge difference in the quality of the air in the cabin.  I no longer had any odors coming in from the outside.  The air was much more fresh smelling due to the activated charcoal in the filter.

Talk about an easy installation.  Just peel off the protective strip on the adhesive on the back of the light strip and firmly attach to below your tailgate.  Then take the connector plug and insert to your 4-pin tow connector and you're done!  You can also cut it and hardwire it directly, but that is going to take a little more work.  Just make sure to match all the colors with your towing harness wires and use butt connectors and heatshrink wire sleeves for water protection.In order to use the reverse lights you will need to put the truck in reverse and remove the tail lights.  Find the reverse light wire and splice the white wire to it.As you can see in the picture it works perfectly and makes the back of the truck more visible.Disclaimer: Product sample provided for free or discounted for an honest unbiased review with no means of payment or incentives offered in exchange.

This thermostat works as intended and opens up way earlier than stock or other Tstats to start the cooling process.  One significant note that is not included with Tstat nor why its there.  There is a small Jiggle pin on the Tstat, this little pin does play a vital role in the install as it lets air pass thru.See Install Vid:  [...]

Amazing solution for a 2013-16 Ford Fusion, error free so they won't turn off after the car is on. Great light output, stronger than stock and no compromise on the spread. You just have make sure they are installed vertically and you will see the gap through the projector for the best output. Pure white light and instantaneous when turned on. Coming from the XenLight is a much more refined product, so far a month with the lights and no issues, unlike that other kit that burned out in 3 weeks. Will definitely buy again.ProsWhite lightStronger than stockInstantaneousFull beam spreadConsClearance, the heat spreaders are quite large once spread out so make sure you have the space for them.Must be installed a certain wait for the best output.Post note for Fusion OwnersYou will have to cut the stock boot (water seal) in order to push through the spreaders.February update.Product is still strong and no signs of wear, still good as new and looking forward to longevity. Also going to purchase the H13 for the high beam on my 14 Fusion.

Assembly: Pretty easy, instructions are pretty vague but you can figure it out by looking at the pieces. Took about 45 minutes to put together.Quality: Okay. Not terrible, not great. Metal is pretty thin so it dents fairly easily but I think it will hold up just find over time.Installation: I couldn't get the hitch pin that was sent with it to fit properly in my receiver so I used another one I had. I had problems with the holes lining up with my hitch receiver so actually had to drill out the holes on this carrier to get the hitch pin in. After that it fit fine.Other thoughts: I have a 4runner with a 3'' lift and bought this based upon others saying the ramp works fine with lifted trucks. Not the case. It's at a pretty steep incline to wheel the dirt bike up on. It's doable but I had to have a 2nd set of hands to keep it straight and push it up. Even with a stock truck or SUV, the ramp should be longer to wheel the bike up on to. Straps down pretty easy but has some play in it so make sure it's tight.All and all, for the money it's hard to beat but it's not the best thing in the world. Cheaper than buying a trailer and stores smaller so it's worth it.

I needed this for some brake calipers pins that I heard was needed so I decided to go with this brand instead of the 3M brand. Well it didn't disappoint me it worked really well and was about $3-$4 cheaper than the 3M brand.For anyone wondering what color the paste is it's like a white/transparent color and came pretty full. It comes with a brush that's attached to the cap of the bottle. I've only used a small amount but I'm sure this will last me quite a while.

I realize this is not labeled as a cleaner, but It also cleaned the painted surface under the hood of my car which I've tried to clean many times with many other cleaners with no luck. So bonus!

I think all Rvs should come equipped with them. Made in the USA great quality and easy install.One Install tip is to been back the curved part of the spring that hooks to the screen you will have to bend it a little bit otherwise you won't get it to hold the more square side of the spring is the one that grabs onto the actual outlet of the furnace

The one area in my husbands cars that have always showed wear and tear was the lower back of the drivers seat.  He tends to carry a wallet, miscellaneous keys, etc. in his back pockets and the rubbing against the leather has always taken a toll.I have tried over the years to devise a comfortable car seat protector but he has usually found them to be a nuisance to keep in place. Even though this car seat protector seems primarily to be designed as protection against child car seat damage, I hoped that it might be a solution for his back pocket problem. It turns out that it works very well to efficiently protect the seat without being an inconvenience to the driver.It fits neatly into the drivers seat and stays in place when entering and exiting, something my makeshift coverings never did.  Because it is thin and flexible, it fits to the contour of the seat and is not uncomfortable.  This car seat protector seems very well designed with extra reinforcement at corners.  It is nicely put together with strong even stitches and the mesh pockets on the bottom are a nice addition.  The only thing that I think would make this better is the option for a lighter color choice to blend with some car interiors.Disclosure: A complimentary product was provided to me for trial and evaluation.

I ordered this net as I wanted the plastic hooks, 1) because they can't rust, and 2) because they are nonconductive, these details are specific in the product description & photo so there was no mistake on my part. I paid extra for this version from amazon prime. What I received was this: http://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Bicycle-Bungie-Cargo-Black/dp/B000WY6ZXA/ref=pd_cp_hi_1 a cheaper metal hook version. Amazon will let me return it, but they give me no way to correct the order and exchange it for what I wanted, I only have the option to return it and re order it, Likely getting the same incorrect one again. This is the first time amazon has failed me at this level, aka given me no real way to fix the problem, and get what i ordered. In addition amazon does not give any way to contact them and tell them one of their merchants is substituting a cheaper model,. Other than a review,. So that's where I'm putting it,. Amazon,.. Seriously,. Epic fail! Sad it's on such a cheap item, but if I can't trust you on a cheap item, why should I trust you with more money.

3 year warranty! All the other hub assemblies have only 0 or 1 year warranties. I'm not sure why they left it out of the description. I don't know why hub assemblies go bad so often. I hope these will be the last ones I buy on my Saab 9-7x. These are made in Korea, which I feel is a lot better then China. Nothing is made in the USA anymore but it is a USA company so you're still buying American. I didn't buy these on Amazon because Advanced Auto sells it for cheaper (after coupon). My only complaint is that the clip for the ABS sensor didn't "click" and lock like the OEMs did so you can slide it in and out without much force. I just zip tied the 2 connectors together. I'll update if anything goes wrong.

I've had these in my 06 f150 and they look awesome! I use them as DRL lights (just turn on my parking lights) and they look great! Super bright, and they flash when I lock my truck. They make the truck look more luxurious and add a different style. Have nothing bad to say about them. Install was easy, just make sure polarity is right..READ THIS!! Get a FLASHER from your local auto store. I've read many negative reviews because the product hyperblinks or doesn't work properly. Your vehicle thinks it's blown out so it'll show on the dash or hyper blink. Buy an aftermarket flasher that connects into your stock flasher. It's way easier than splicing your wires!! THAT PART IS IMPORTANT! This will fix the hyper blinking and any problems related.Update: 8/29/15 for about 2 weeks, my passenger side white light has been out. It works with just the parking lights and turns orange with the turn signals, but does not have enough power to supply light when my headlights are on top. They become very dim. So, they lasted me about 5 months. Will be buying another set.

I bought these for a license plate light for my camaro but they are a little bit bigger around than a standard 194 bulb so they wouldn't fit in the housing. As luck would have it, my other car takes the same bulb for the license plate lights. I waited until dark so I could take good before and after pictures but it turns out both of the old bulbs were bad so I can only show the after. These are actually brighter than I expected. I will be ordering more of these to replace other bulbs throughout my cars.

Quality of parts is really nice but when you first open the package and the first thing you see is a disclaimer saying they will not be responsible for missing parts,  from my experience that just means you have poor instructions and this holds true. Very bad instructions. The small package of retrofit parts for a 1990 Sportster were wrong and would not fit without the correct without cutting threads or drilling the hole larger. If I did this wrong it's because of the poor instructions and absolutely no phone number for customer service I wouldn't suggest this kit for somebody that didn't have the ability to drill or tap holes. If it wasn't for the problem with the specific parts for the 1990 model it would have been a great kit.

Seem to be very well made and the size fit perfect based upon measurement. Well packaged storage bag for when not in use.I placed them on without ties for the bottom and they are snug so Im hoping the stay in place with any wind. The corner ties seem like they will require climbing under the chassis to connect them? If needed if most likely use a bungee cord but would still need to lay down and pull it behind the tires.

I still used a Bristled brush to agitate the dirt but the cleaner did most of the work ! I have their liquid paint sealant as well and that stuff is amazing as well. Definitely a great product will order again.

Perfect for under hood lighting. I installed this on my '15 Tundra. Very simple to install. The directions were easy to understand if you're not confident with wiring things.  I used a pre-existing hole for the spring/hood switch. Tuck the wiring away and use the provided zip ties.I bought this because recently I had helped someone jumpstart their vehicle in the dark. Not that it was difficult, but it would have been nice to have some light in the engine compartment while using the jumper cables.DPLake Stevens, WA

Extremely easy install! Looks great under the hood and it does its job. I had no issue with any of the clamps as I read in some reviews. Luck of the draw I suppose. Great product highly recommend for any 6.0.

Looks great, a bit thinner than I expected, but if it holds up under normal conditions, it's worth the money - the raised Toyota logo is sharp!

before you start filling read this and save a lot of aggravation.first start by marking acid bottle with five marks 3/4 inch's apart with a permanent marker  will load pic, this give's you 6 cells,  funnels doesn't work don't use , . next take the over flow tubing that comes with it, snip off the pouring plastic opposite  the red cap, don't touch the red cap. don't try t puncture it its wobbly, snip it or a very sharp knife, just the tip. , slowly slip the over flow tubing on, make sure it's snug and won't come off,. then put the other end in the fill hole, its snug but fits nice, .push it gently .till  it hit's the plates in the battery, just get the acid bottle above the level of the battery and don't squeeze the bottle it will run out on its own, when you see it has stopped filling and has some in the tube above the fill hole lower the acid bottle below the level of bottom of battery and the excess acid will run back in the bottle, squeeze the fill tube close to fill hole pull out and move to next hole. again push till it stops on the battery plates, raise acid bottle above battery let gravity fill,there is exactly enough to fill to the top mark on all cells with no extra keep a paper towel to whip small drops of acid on battery.safety.. have a open container of water if you accidently got some in your face or hands .took me a hour and half, but could have been done in 15 minutes, looking for tiny funnel that will no work.gave it a 4 star because of no directions to fill

I needed a plastic and sturdy license plate frame that will not really rust.  I'm also looking for a cheap one.  Most steel license plate frames are kind of expensive.  This did the trick.  After more than 2 years, this frame is holding pretty well.It came with 4 black screws and caps.  I didn't use them because I needed those screws that couldn't be removed easily.

Excellent panoramic view. Placement is at the discretion of the user. I used masking tape to temporarily attach them on my rear view mirrors so I can see what works best for me. After a couple of test placements and seat adjustments, I decided to place mine in the upper right corner of the left mirror and ULC of the right mirror. They work real well. I posted a picture that was taken while stopped at a light. You can see a white pickup truck on the Blind Spot Mirror that doesn't appear in the regular rear view mirror. Wow!I highly recommend this product to anyone who's looking for a blind spot mirror.

Be warned! The 20mm spacers come with bolts that only have about 37-40mm of thread. This only allowed for 4.5 turns to torque spec.Emailed the seller and they replied with the bolts being 50mm as advertised is total bolt length. So plan to also buy bolts with 45mm of thread for correct fitment or risk your wheels falling off.Also noticed that the cone seat may not be 60 degrees as im noticing only a small ring of wear instead of the entire seat making contact.

Installed on my 2014 chevy silverado 1500 double cab. Instillation straight forward. Rear end took about 45 minutes total and front took about 45 min each side. Extra jack and extra set of hands helps. Installed 275 70r18 goodyear duratrac, no rub, fits perfectly and fills out wheel well. Also purchased Hellwig 987 springs to eliminate sag when loaded as we tow multiple trailers weekly. Works perfect, photos of before, leveld, and level plus tires.

This is a tough review to write because I could see giving this product anywhere from 2 to 4-5 stars.At $660.28 (Amazon price at the time of this review; other prices in this review are also from the time of this review) it's very reasonably priced for a 3500w generator (especially when compared to some of the big names: take a look at, for example, the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Yamaha-EF2400iSHC-2000-Running-Watts-2400-Starting-Watts-Gas-Powered-Portable-Inverter/dp/B00AYUWDZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Yamaha EF2400iSHC, 2000 Running Watts/2400 Starting Watts, Gas Powered Portable Inverter</a>&nbsp;(btw, I have this generator and really like it). Same feature set as this Coleman, but only 2400w and almost twice the price!).Cost, though, is about all it has going for it. It's not exactly feature-rich (the feature set is almost identical to the Yamaha I just mentioned and the Yamaha is a model from 5 or more years ago), very heavy (70 lbs), louder than what is sort of the standard today (63 db versus 59 db (not sure how much I can hear the difference, though)), no parallel capability, no electric start (doesn't really need one, though), and only two 120v and one 12v DC outlets. This is a feature set one would expect from a 2000-2400w generator (or smaller). The lack - on a 3000w or greater generator - of a 120v/30amp outlet and additional 120v outlets and features really highlights that cost is where the emphasis is.To drive home the point about cost being the selling point, compare this Coleman with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Briggs-Stratton-30651-P2200-PowerSmart-Series-Portable-2200-Watt-Inverter-Generator-with-Parallel-Capability/dp/B01A6I1WUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Briggs & Stratton 30651 P2200 PowerSmart Series Portable 2200-Watt Inverter Generator with Parallel Capability</a>&nbsp;(another generator I have experience with). Note that the Briggs and Stratton has far more features (to include parallel capability (using the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Briggs-Stratton-6278-120-Volt-Parallel-Cable-Connector-Kit-for-PowerSmart-Series-Inverters/dp/B00N8QI3NO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Briggs & Stratton 6278 120 Volt Parallel Cable Connector Kit for PowerSmart Series Inverters</a>). It's quieter (by spec; again, I can't really tell after 30 years in the military) and weighs less. It's a far more capable generator at roughly the same price ($631.69), but it's also only rated at 2200w. So you're getting 3000+w for the same price as a 2000-2400w generator.Perhaps a better comparison is the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Briggs-Stratton-30545-P3000-PowerSmart-3000-Watt-Inverter-Generator-with-4-120-Volt-AC-Outlets-1-12-Volt-DC-Outlet/dp/B00IWJOOU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Briggs & Stratton 30545 P3000 PowerSmart 3000-Watt Inverter Generator with (4) 120-Volt AC Outlets & (1) 12-Volt DC Outlet</a>. Again, far more features (to include some very handy wheels and a pull handle), but it's almost $500 more expensive! So you're getting the same wattage, but at a far lower price.So it seems the prospective buyer has decide which of the following is important: price, features, watts, performance. It's not very versatile, but not everyone needs versatility. If versatility is a must, then I'm not sure this is what you would want to buy. But if two outlets is really all you're going to need, then I can see this - at this point - as a nice purchase.But there's more that needs to be considered I think. I just stated, "if two outlets...." I purposely neglected the 12v DC outlet because it's - to me - fairly worthless. Many (most?) generators give you a "cigarette lighter" style 12v outlet that can use adapters to accomplish different tasks. This has a special "T-style" outlet and all you get with the generator is a battery clamp accessory to fit this outlet. Disappointing. You do get a spark plug wrench and a screwdriver. But you also get a disappointingly vague user manual. I always start with 5 stars and go from there. Lack of features and strange design choice cause it to lose a star. So down from 5 stars ("I love it") to 4 stars ("I like it").But don't go looking for a more comprehensive .pdf version of the manual or other support-related info online. You won't find it. This is a Coleman-licensed product offered by Coleman Powersports (colemanpowered dot com). If you go to the company's website you will find absolutely zilch about generators. No mention that they sell them, no support, no parts, nothing. I took the two access covers off to see if I could find out who makes the engine. Nothing. I guess I might be able to tell if I totally disassembled the engine from the casing, but I'm not going to do that. So while this might be a great deal in the short run I'm not sure it's a good one in the long run. It runs. But for how long? What about support? Will it serve long-term needs or will the lack of features make it less useful down the road? This lack of information and support concerns me. As a result I subtracted another star. Now we're at 3 stars ("It's okay").I think "3 stars" is a fair place to stay because when all things are considered I'm not at all in love with this generator (or even really like it). I think there are two better approaches. First, spend a bit more money and get more features (if you really need the watts). Or second, spend the same amount of cash (if you can spare the watts) to get more features initially and upgrade as you can. I opted for the second approach: I bought one of the 2200w B&S generators and then added a second (along with the parallel adapter I mentioned above) a little while later. (And btw, I'm very happy with the choice of generator and choice of incrementally adding on wattage.)Some closing thoughts.... To my surprise the color in the product photo is quite faithful to the real thing. I thought the photo was almost certainly "off" a bit and fully expected a "Coleman red" generator to show up. But what I got was a "Coleman pinkish/reddish" generator (just like the photo). Not bad, but strangely un-Coleman.Finally, at 70 lbs and with no integrated wheels/handle this is a bit heavy. So I use a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Olympia-Tools-85-180-300-Lb-Capacity-Folding-Platform-Truck/dp/B003ES5TK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Olympia Tools 85-180 300 Lb Capacity Folding Platform Truck</a>&nbsp;to wheel it around.3 stars. Lots not to like. But if you need 3000+ watts and cost is an issue this might just be worth considering. If so, I can't emphasize enough  that the prospective buyer needs to go in with eyes open; this isn't exactly feature-rich and the lack of info and support may mean trouble down the road.

I installed these as interior lights in my F150.  I wanted something brighter for when I'm trying to find things in the massive center console and also something that did a better job illuminating the rest of the interior.  I've had them installed a few weeks now and they are working great.  They are a clean white light, not blue or yellow.  I plan on ordering more to replace the remaining incandescent lights that are on my truck.  I received these lights at a discount in exchange for testing and reviewing the product. I stand by my review and do not give discounted products great reviews if they do not deserve them. I count on honest reviews when making purchases as much as you do!

Finally got a chance to use this and when you follow instructions to a "T" (totally no fun, but...), it works like magic. Takes some pressure, but letting it heat up good and hot is key, along with slow, steady, firm pushing, not trying to rip right through. Works, gets hot, REALLY hot, and cuts a lovely groove that looks factory. Also, the package said it was made in U.S.A., I looked at a map of China and couldn't find that town? Odd. No matter, quality built and works just as it says. Before, during and after pics with the groover.

Previous owner installed this, however they never cleaned the filter. It was seriously coated in dirt and dust. I cleaned it using a K&N recharge kit, and now the engine can breathe. The Mass Airflow Sensor was bad in the car, was throwing P0172 codes and causing a crappy Idle. I replaced it, and the issue was fixed. I tried cleaning the original sensor, however it seems as this filter wasn't taken care of, the crap that got through killed the sensor. Sounds good, doubt it gives any noticeable performance benefit unless you make a heat shield for it. It would probably be better to keep a stock airbox and use a Randal intake, but if all you are after is a good growl, then this is for you. Just be sure to take care of it so you don't kill your MAF

This thing works great. As far as the water proof part I personally believe the front display section of the product is water proof. But the rear portion where wires are located isn't water proof. It appears the gauge was designed to inserted through the front of a panel/dash. If the gauge was installed in this fashion with some type of RTV or gasket maker to seal the back section from moisture I'm sure it work just fine. Another solutin would be to coat the entire back of the gauge with glue form a hot glue gun. I'm installing this gauge in the dash of my car. So this exceeds my requirements. I tested the accuracy and it was great. It only displays in tenths. For example say the battery is at 12.18V the gauge will display 12.2V. But if the battery is at 12.11V the gauge will display 12.1V. This gauge is a great deal. Here's a picture I took to show its accuracy. Sorry for the poor lighting but you get the idea.

I've had this system on a Wrangler JKU for about a month and a half so far.  We've taken two short camping trips with our 2,170lbs trailer with this airbag system installed.The positive:  It helps dramatically by lifting the rear of the Jeep back up when towing.  It's also very easy to install (although I deliberately installed this upside down because their way doesnt make sense).The negative: After the first trip a bottom spacer fell out, but airlift sent a new one for free (they are now secured with zipties).  After the second trip, the system wouldnt hold air.  I found that a bag was leaking due to a hole in the side.  I don't over inflate the bags, and haven't been off-road with them.  But once again airlift sent a new one for free under waranty.Overall, after such a short time with this installed, it doesn't seem like a very sturdy system.  Blowing a bag after two short trips is obviously not what anyone is looking for. I'm not sure this system can be depended on for long distance or long term.  But airlift's customer service and warranty is great.  Fixing the broken parts is easy as well.  I'll be adding a weight distribution hitch to my trailer for longer trips now because I don't trust the airbags to hold up.

I have both a 2008 Nissan Altima and a 2013 Nissan Pathfinder, so while Amazon said this was a good fit for the Pathfinder, reading the reviews made me a bit skeptical. So I decided to buy one, try it out in my Pathfinder and if it didn't fit, I would just use it in my Altima. First, let me say that Nissan's engineering of the Cabin Air Filter "holder" leaves a lot to be desired. Getting to the filter is a bit of a pain, though it is much easier on the Pathfinder than the Altima. The filter slides in (as opposed to dropping in like most factory engine air filters) and Nissan's cover for the cabin air filter is much shorter than the length of the air filter. So you need to slide one corner of the filter in, then compress the filter to get the other far corner in; Then do the same on the near side. That's why you see so many pictures of filters looking like mangled accordions. As many other reviewers stated, wonderful people have contributed video tutorials on YouTube for exact install details. Know the process, take your time, and you'll be fine.So when I removed the factory air filter from the 2013 Pathfinder, the Fram had the same width and thickness--the length was about an inch longer. So I tried to install it, figuring the filter may just compress a bit. The filter did go it, but the sides buckled a bit, which likely left more gaps along the edges than there should be. So I removed it and instead of just installing it in my Altima, I decided to cut it down to the same length as the factory filter and try again. This worked out well. The filter went it and the buckling was reduced (there was still some buckling because the edges are kind of a cardboard material and once creased, they'll likely always bend at those points). Seeing as this is a cabin air filter and the impact of not having an absolutely perfect fit is likely insignificant, I'm going to call it a win and move on with my life. I picked up another for my Altima and the CF11173 matched its size perfectly.When comparing this side-by-side with the Nissan cabin air filters, the Fram appears to be much better quality--but I have absolutely no quantitative reason to make this claim. It just feels sturdier and better made. And one of best features of the Fram filter is it includes a small tab that you can use to get the filter out when the time comes to replace it (getting those factory filters out is more challenging than it really should be). I've run this Fram filter before in an Infiniti and I was happy with it. It's a car cabin air filter, so it's hard to get too excited about it, but it seems to do the job. The air in my cars smells, well, like clean air.At under $20, you can save a [relatively] good bit of money by doing this small piece of automotive maintenance yourself.

Good urgency and increased volume to horn's sound. It is a 6 amp draw, so one horn will work with the vehicle's original relay. Easy to install, the vehicle's power lead fits this horn's spade connection. I didn't use the OE mounting bracket just the one provided with this horn. It mounts the horn higher and allows the power lead to reach the horn easier, even though I clocked the horn to point down (to prevent water and debris from collecting inside). 15-20 minutes to install, works very, very well!

I installed this winch and it would not wind in. I contacted Truck & Winch and they responded withing 6 hours of my e-mail. They had me reverse the black and yellow wire to see what happens. If it winds in its the solenoid, if nothing happens its probably the motor. Nothing happened and they will be sending me a new motor I guess. They said they would honor the warranty Will update later.

Like it and it was worth the buy for my dodge diesel truck. I had it mounted outside of the wheel at first but isn't very practical. Now it's inside and seems to work much better. Also I needed to add a little rubber filler piece to make it bolt down snug. I cut a piece of an old washing machine hose, split it down one side and it worked perfectly. Rock solid.

This magneto brought my 257 back to life.  I was a little reluctant to purchase this magento after reading the reviews saying the plug wire was too short.  The plug wire was very near the same length as the original in my saw.  The kill switch wire looks very close to the same length as the original but I didn't use it and reused the original instead.  I knocked off two stars from a five rating due to fact I had to make a slight modification to mount the coil.  The "ground tab" is different than the original and had to be modified to install the coil.  I cut the ground tap/loop in half, moved it closer to the coil body and soldered the two halves together.  I have come to expect this over the years with aftermarket parts, some assembly/mods required!  I would have purchased the OEM part for $50 more if I was certain the coil was the issue on my saw that has been in storage for 10+ years.  I can't complain too much given the price of this coil vs. the OEM part.  The attached photos show the original and aftermarket coil, the ground tab, and the modification.

Definitely worth the money and we've had them on for over a year now and haven't lost one to any potholes or anything.(I even sold the OEM hubcaps on Craigslist for $40-bucks so it was almost a wash!

**Update**Seller contacted me saying they didn't know that their vendor changed the switch style?? Seriously??I explained that the reason I bought the light was because of the switch.  That way I can select lighting modes.  They then stated they have one for sale with different modes....down side is that I don't need that one.  Nor is it the size I require!!Hopefully they stand behind their ADVERTISED product and at least send out the proper switch. We will have to wait and see.The light however does work as it should. Nice bright crisp light.Dissapointed.The ad shows that includes a switch so you can turn in either the spot lights or flood lights separately.The switch that was included with my light is just a single switch that turns the whole light on or off......

15" spring steel w/ wire wrap for noise cancellation. Black coating, no thin areas. Made in USA.Installed on 2017 RAM Laramie. Direct mount w/ stainless threading, no spacers needed. Small drop of thread locker added for extra security.Why 15" instead of 6"? Basically function over form. Initially I tried a rubber 6" antenna and a aluminum 6" version. Both had range issues over 20 miles with a regular broadcast and difficulties with HD signals over 40 miles. The little antennas are quite noticeable as they are very unique and scream "pull on me!"I travel 100 miles from home daily. Major city centers are located 60 miles north and 70 miles southwest. My home has 2 stations with no HD. The 15" antenna picks up HD broadcasts from both city centers just a good as the OEM antenna. There is no whipping or bending at highway speeds.All-in-all, this is a very capable antenna that blends in with any exterior, receives standard and HD broadcasts as well as the OEM antenna.

Works great as a replacement for power wheels cars with a little wiring modification.  No need to spend over 2x the cost of a power wheel one!

I had a sprayed in bed liner. I took a Dremel and sanded the three holes out in the F150. If your sprayed in Berliner folks did it right you can skip that part. Took my hand and not a hammer. Stuck the plastic insert in. I needed a T50 torx bit to tighten. It's an outstanding extender.  What  I like about it is it will unlock in the middle and fold lock to the sides. You can then put long stuffs in your bed without removing

I love this Product. Fits my '07 CRVs door pillars perfectly. It literally is like a mirror. Although it is a fingerprint magnet, literally it makes me want it to shine even more :-) Im very pleased with it.Now, if you have deflectors installed b4 this product, which was my case. I shall say - Unfortunately; It will require complete removal of those, which added extra time to whole installation process since deflectors were taped and the goo was horrific to wipe off completely. And more work to come as to put the deflectors back, which I might buy darker ones since the set I have is more of a light brown than deep black which really is my desire.Apart from that, these pillar covers are very neat and change the look a whole Lot. It also covered little cosmetic dents to original pillars which seems to have a rubber coating and was little ugly tear n scratch here and there. Now It looks fabulous, I don't know why Honda didn't put these as stock with all their crvs since lining around windows is chrome by itself.Very easy installation, I personally recommend applying it on a hot day in direct sunlight when both the pillars and these covers get super hot b4 taping it down, and before pulling the protective film off I still used hairdryer on the hot hot high setting and pushed on it so that the 3M adhesion will bond to it permanently, Especially at all the edges, mainly the edges which will face the wind when driving fast,even with the deflectors. Just in case.I'am very satisfied with the product, and the seller as well since I could see it was packed to withstand any possible, even impossible handling by the shipping companies nowadays. Thank You so much! :-)

Ok. I got this idea from a YouTube video. I wanted to dress up my boring engine compartment. So I went out looking for high heat engine paint. So I was like why not try one of the biggest names in the spray paint business. So my choice was this paint. So I prep my valve cover, cleaned it up got all the grease and grime off of it. I dedicated one of my off days to see what happens. I mean it's mainly for me. The hoods close and I don't do car shows, but I think that those car show guys use this as well. So I sprayed a few light coats on and basically took my time with it. I also changed the valve cover gaskets also. Perfect time to do it. I think it turned out pretty good. I will update my review to let you guys know how durable it is. But it went on smooth.

Works great! The air compressor circuit on my old truck was messed up, so I wanted a way to turn the compressor on and off in the cab.  I wanted a nice large switch so I wouldn't accidentally leave the compressor clutch engaged and run my battery down.  I gave this a shot and am very pleased with it.  It looks great and feels very sturdy.  I'll definitely buy more of these!

I've seen youtube videos and form posts of low quality snatch blocks blowing apart so I was concerned going with such a low priced snatch block. This TGL snatch block is greasable and will require you to have a grease gun before your first use as it doesn't ship greased. This shouldn't be a big deal because most people buying offroad recovery equipment should already have one.So far I've used this snatch black 3 or 4 times pulling out my Jeep. It makes redirecting pulls a breeze and when you're really stuck it's great for doubling the pulling power of your winch. I also like to use it when I don't want to spool out a lot of rope and don't want to potentially strain my winch with multiple wraps on the drum.I also have a couple TGL d-ring shackles, and a TGL tree saver that I use with this block and they've been great through the abuse they've endured.

Much thicker  than Saddle man gel pad and also a few bucks cheaper....I have been installing many gel pads for motorcycle seats and it makes a HUGE difference in riding, comfort and heat stress on your bottom!This material ( first time order ) seems to be very high quality and is very thick....should be no problem install.It even comes with a finishing foam to cover the gel padded seat ! Nice extra to have...I usually use head liner foam, but this works same way. It is very important that you cover your finished seat with a final thin layer of foam to keep pad in place and make it look smooth when reattaching seat cover !!Will order more of this gel pad in the near future....

I bought the Trektop NX in Black Diamond to replace my 2005 TJ stock factory soft top mainly for the Sunrider roof. I love the idea of just flipping the top back and letting in the sun/fresh air without the hassle of taking the windows out, lowering the roof, etc. I don't think I will even miss or care about taking the entire roof off because I never have anyone sitting in the back seat anyway and like the idea of having the Safari roof, which looks incredible and is pretty much how I ran with the factory soft top.Many have concerns about window storage and taking them with you in the Jeep. If you take the plastic inserts out of the side windows you can indeed roll them and the rear window up or put them in a window bag (Bestop now offers the Window Storage Portfolio, and specifically says the Trektop NX windows will fit in it). After removing the plastic inserts (which is extremely easy), I was able to lay them in my Cloverpatch bag and roll them up same as the stock windows. It helps if you lay them out in the sun for a few minutes to soften then up. So no issues with window storage as far as I'm concerned.I was very impressed with the high quality of this top. I ordered it from Amazon (shipped from Jegs) and it came in a few days. Everything was in order and in perfect shape. The directions were fairly clear but it helps if you watch the excellent video that's available on Youtube or Bestop.com and gives you step by step instructions on how to install it. Everything you need comes with it and is factory quality. The black diamond color I got looked great and matched my Bestop soft doors perfectly.The hardest part of the install was putting the knobs into the door surrounds. For some reason the front part just didn't want to line up and I needed help to manhandle it on this part so everything would line up and I could thread the knobs in all the way. Otherwise the entire install (including taking off my factory top) went well, without any problems and took me about 2 hours, and that was with frequent breaks.It helps if you do this on a HOT sunny day. It was 85 degrees and sunny and I laid out the top and window for 3 hours in the sun and installed it in sunlight. HIGHLY recommend this!They give you 8 screws, which is what came on my factory top, to attach the top to the headliner but there are 14 (earlier years came with more screws from the factory) holes in the headliner. I added 6 and found that the top laid much nicer on the headliner.I also recommend waiting until the top is all buckled down and attached front and back before attaching the front straps to the rollbar to get the best fit possible.The only part I wasn't impressed with was the rear straps/buckles. They seemed attached rather flimsily and after reading how they broke easily I was careful not to pull on them too much. IMO, they should be reinforced at the attachment point and made of thicker/wider material. I installed mine without any problems.The window install went well but the windows had been sitting for hours in the sun so they were soft and pliable. Everything zipped up nicely. Be sure to follow the directions for putting the windows in EXACTLY and in the right order. I am letting the windows stay installed for a few days so they will stretch out. I am wondering how well they will do when the weather is cooler and I put them in cooler temperatures.Once in, the windows and top looked great and factory. Everything zipped together and fit perfectly. Windows are tight and wrinkle free. The Sunrider feature works well and I flipped it back with doors off and took a ride and there wasn't any flapping or problems. Am looking forward to taking the windows out and enjoying the Safari top with Sunrider this summer. Taking the doors off just adds to the fun!Highly recommend this top. Will update and add if this changes but I'm really, really happy I got this top.UPDATE: Over 2 months later and the top is holding up beautifully. No issues. Rear straps are staying on well and it does great at highway speeds. I've had the windows in and out and have gone though the summer without the windows, leaving it with the safari top. The weather has been hot since I installed it. Will see how it goes when it gets colder.

This is my 2nd bar of this curved type, I had previously put a 42" 300 watt on a 92 D21 pickup and it fit the brushguard very nicely.This shorter one (28", 144w) is a near perfect fit in the grill of my 96 Pathfinder. I sawed out the old grill section and fabricated a horizontal mounting bar tied to the radiator support and hood latch riser, and bolted the light bar to that. This worked out even better than I expected, has a clean OEM look and keeps it safe, behind the bumper. Also, being "frenched" in like this the hardware is harder to get at, so its a bit less likely to be stolen.Can't say enough good things about these, for the money they are just amazing. In addition to offroad, I use these when in deer country as they light up the sides of the road well into the fields and have helped prevent deer/truck incidents.OK, now for the Bad. -1 star ...the driver circuit in this thing has terrible RF interference and wipes out even FM radio. I'll be opening it up to fix it and will post a solution, some day

First off this thing is not 14" x 14".  The outside dimensions of this lid cover is 13" x 13".  This is just FYI.  There is only one size of Jensen bathroom vent, so you don't need to worry about size.  What you need to worry about is the hings system.  There are two Jensen hinge systems.  If your RV is newer then 2004, then you have the new hinge system.  If it is older then 2004, you have the old system (unless the whole unit has been replace with a newer one.) For new RV owners, this information is not readily available anywhere and they might get confused by the size discrepancy of their vent cover and what is listed on the box.I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 only because I think Camco could do a much better job of describing this product.  The product itself is fine and fits my new style Jesen vent perfectly.

fits my Hidden hitch receiver, good quality parts... works and looks great... would-be meddlers will keep looking for easier prey.UPDATE:  APR16 2017 - So I'm getting ready to pull my camper to the driveway for the 2017 season.  Only to find I cannot get the key in the lock to put on my hitch!  ! Hit it with WD and PB Blstr, 24hrs later, still no go  :(  VERY FRUSTRATING!!Ive re-reviewed other comments (which I thought I did before I bought this product)... and im def not the only one with this issue.  Had to cut it off....  See picture of how yours may look in a few years if you buy this one.The rubber seal connecting lanyard fell off during first year of use I think, and the round rubber seal went missing shortly after that.  I suppose its true I could have sprayed lube up there a few times/yr and not had this issue.  Master Lock is better than this... but then, maybe not?Buyer Beware

Driving home from a camping trip, my truck tells me the right turn signal light on the trailer wasn't working. I didn't even know my truck could do that. I found I had used all my spares, so I dug around on Amazon, and found these led replacements. The bulbs I need are the two element type, one element for "driving" lights (the lights that are on when the headlights are on), and a second element that turns on when you apply the bakes, making the bulb even brighter, also known as a "3157" bulb. Installation was easy, the red lens is held in place with tabs on both sides, no tools required for removal, just a slight flexing of the plastic around the tabs. The bulb is a press fit, it slides right in and out, no turning or twisting required. If you are replacing a bulb that is still working, TURN IT OFF AND LET IT COOL. It will burn your fingers if you try to pull it out hot.  If it is burned out, check to see if the glass is cracked, it could easily break into sharp pieces when pulling it out if it is cracked.The led bulb is very compact, I there is plenty of room in the fixture and absolutely no clearance issues whatsoever.As you can see in the pictures, this bulb is an almost exact match to the brightness of the incandescent bulb it is replacing.  The led bulb is on the right, the incandescent is on the left. One picture shows the light at "driving lights" (headlights on) level.  The other shows it with the brakes applied.  I am very happy with this bulb as a replacement.  BTW, the small white thing on the tool box is the burnt out bulb from the right side.I replaced both bulbs, and plan on buying at least two more as spares, should I ever need them while on the road.I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review

I bought a truck that had a flatbed on it, the original owner put a 05+ wiring harness on it, therefore the yellow turn signals were now used as a running light as well. So I bought these since they are completely red and tinted perfectly, they fixed my issue and look even better and cheaper than factory replacements...they can be seen during the day without hazard..

Just hooked up the new LED light on my 2010 Harley Ultra Glide. It now looks like the fog light. It's bright but thought it would put out more light. Pretty simple to install. There is a small fan that you can hear when the bike is off but that is it. I have before and after pic with the led fog lights.

I don't have a garage so I keep my bikes outside. Ordered the sporty size for my GZ250, covers it well- to the ground in the back, and half-way down the front tire. I ordered the XL for my C50 Boulevard. Fully dressed it fits the C50 great- to the ground on the back (over my bags and rack) and enough to keep the front disc brake covered on the front, even with my windshield on. Both sizes of this cover have kept my bikes completely dry and have held up to heat very well. I've covered my bike immediately after a long ride, and had no issues with the material. I love the clip underneath- it keeps the cover on even in the Kansas wind and during storms! Cover isn't dust-proof, but does everything else. It is also nice to have the option to run a lock through the cover.

I matched them with some 6k VLEDS Triton V3 switchbacks in smoked depot corners and they look amazing. They're a little slow to power up or switch back to white DRL from amber turn, but that's alright because it gives them a cool effect as the Tritons are quicker to go to white DRL. The amber turn is instant though, so there's no delay with the hazard or turn signals.When I say these are stupidly bright, I'm not joking around. I've been flashed at night with my low beams on, and during the day drivers of oncoming traffic are always staring at my car.I've taken a video of the AEs installed in my 2001 BMW e46 325xit with the OEM halogen housings. The install was pretty easy and straightforward. My car is programmed for double-flash hazards and to flash the turn signals on lock/unlock. I have the white DRL tied into the ACC line by the ECM, so the DRL mode comes on when I turn the key, and turns off a few seconds after the car is shut off.The only downside to these is they produce a lot of electrical noise and inject static into my FM radio when in use.UPDATE: I have since done an HID retrofit into my halogen housings using FX-R projectors & the E46 rep shroud. I used some JB Weld to secure the AEs to the shrouds as the included double-sided tape was useless. They look just as great with either halogen or HID lights!

I used this tool to perform a timing belt service and to replace the camshaft seals which requires the removal of the camshaft gears/pulleys in my 1998 Toyota 4Runner with the 3.4L engine.  It worked great for all three pulleys (two camshaft and one crankshaft pulley).  I was also able to use it to pull off the harmonic balancer/crankshaft pulley as I did not have a puller for this task.  I don't recommend this as it was not built for this, but it worked beautifully as a makeshift puller to avoid having to ride my bike to the parts store to rent the tool and was an added bonus for buying the tool.

The part is great.  The shipping lost parts for both lower arms that I received.  Both had damaged boxes with the ball end protruding from the box.  One was missing the bolt and the grease fitting.  The other was missing the grease fitting.  I could not use the old grease fittings as they were pressed in.  The closest auto parts store on this project day only had the size I needed in a $14 variety pack.So what about the arm itself?  It was a perfect fit.Should I have replaced them when the ball was still functional?  Well, I was redoing most of the other parts in the front end and this is literally to bolts and the last part you will take out... and the the first part you will put back in.  In the end the 13 year old ones had some issues.  The rubber fittings on the frame side were cracked, or the rubber had shrunk/compressed away from the ends.  So, YES it was worth replacing them.The front end rebuild results are amazing.  I won't miss the bobble head motion I had adopted on bumpy roads.

I ordered these for my '08 Honda Fit Sport. The item was delivered on time and arrived in perfect condition. Upon looking at the decals, they do seem like they're possibly slightly smaller than whats actually on a Civic Si, however this doesn't affect my rating as the product is as advertised and overall still looks great.The only reason I would say the install is pretty easy is that I am a terrible judge when it comes to lining things up straight. My advice is to just take some time to measure out where you want your decals and "mark" your measurements with some painters tape.These decals are typical "rub on" vinyl decals. Before peeling the backing I ended up cutting off the i and the dash so the decals just read VTEC SOCH as first gen Fits have Vtec engines, not the i-Vtec. Cutting off the i- was easy and did not affect the decal in any way.Applying the decal was easy. Take your time and pull from the corners as if you go to quickly some of the letter edges won't lift at first, but again, this doesn't affect my rating as even if they start to lift when peeling the backing or after applying and removing the cover layer, just press down and try lifting slower next time and they will stay put.Overall the results look fantastic and I am very happy with the end result.

I used this paint to coat my dull grey engine covers on my Mustang. First I used adhesion promoter, them hi heat silver paint as a base. Then you apply several light coats to cover the part. If you look closely you can spot a few runs. So work carefully in light coats. And to finish it off clearcoat and wax. When done it looks anodized. When compared to buying a quart of Deep Impact Blue and Clearcoat it's much more affordable. In case you were wondering, the white lettering and stripe comes from The Anchor Room on ebay. It takes a while to get the lettering to sit right but probably faster than painting.

I wish I would have known this existed back when I needed a solution to relocate the fuel inlet on my Edelbrock 1406 in order to have room to install the air cleaner.  I had purchased the Edelbrock 8089 banjo fitting which worked but not as well.  The banjo fitting sits VERY close to the body of the carburetor which means you can't slip the fuel line onto it and the hose clamp over the hose once it's installed.  I found i had to actually install the fuel line and hose clamp on the banjo fitting first and then attach the banjo fitting to the carburetor.  Not with this gem!  This routes the fuel inlet down the side of the carburetor, under the choke linkages and out the front side of the carburetor.  More than enough room now for the air cleaner and it's a much cleaner looking installation.

Rugged good quality! The cigarette lighter plug and dual USB DC charger come on a thick plastic panel but they can be removed and individually installed. the panel is 4.15 inches wide by 1.67 inches high and a beefy 0.21 inches thick. Each plug comes with a splash proof plug to seal the socket preventing water or sand from entering the empty jack. The two plugs can be removed and put into either side. There are star nuts behind each socket that lock the jack down tightly into either the panel or directly into a waiting 1.13 inch hole. The length of the threaded portion of the jack is 1.2". There are standard 0.25" spade lugs and the vendor included the correct matching female jacks.The USB adapter has a blue LED light that is illuminated under the slash plug indicating available USB power. It has a 5V (volt) 1A (amp) and 5V 2.1A outlet to charge both lower and higher power requirement devices. Most cell phones will work fine in either outlet but larger devices like an iPad or other tablet will charge faster in the 2.1A circuit.The description mentions AC power - this is purely a DC device meant to be hooked up to a 12 volt battery in a car, truck, boat, or RV. The cigarette adapter is not marked as to its power rating but it appears to be very rugged and I would guess it's good for 10 amps. My requirement is only for 3 amps and its handled that with no problem.In my application for use in an RV it's worked very well.

This filter element is a very tight fit. It's slightly bigger than the dealer-installed element I replaced. It also has a different filter pattern.The included photo shows the difference between the new one and the one installed by the dealer. The old has plastic separators that make it more rigid and sturdy than the new. YMMV.It's entirely possible that the dealer installed an aftermarket item. I wouldn't put it past them.  In any case, this filter works just fine.

Can't say anything bad about the gun -- well constructed and built to last a lifetime. However, I see what people are talking about with the instructions. They're not really instructions. No parts labeled, nothing but a drawing of the unit itself, and another small diagram showing the spring release pulled back and locked. Other than that, the instructions literally consist of one 107-word run-on sentence that leaves you scratching your head. So just don't even read it, just throw it in the trash unless you want to laugh.

Do you NEED these? Maybe not. They sure come in handy though. No looking for zip ties or wire to bend.  They're hanging hooks, I'm sure you'll find other uses for them around the garage as well.They also offer a stainless steel set for the same $ (at the time of writing). You might accidentally let the stainless ones drive away. I'm fairly sure you won't leave the yellow ones hanging. (Hey, I made a pun there.)

i did Mother's 3 step process that include the polisher & micro polisher. I applied with a microfiber applicator and buffed with a electric polisher.  My car is less than a year old so wanted to protect the paint. I used this on the rims, headlights and parts of the chrome trim as well. It was a long day since I had to vacuum and wash first. The next day it drizzled rain a bit but by afternoon the sun came out and there were no unsightly spots to ruin my hard work. i am very pleased with the results. this pic is of that day after it rained. im impressed.

I personally think this is over priced however, it is well worth it to avoid the hassle and avoid painting the stock chrome bezel and it a direct replacement. So it's a no brainer.

After two years of putting this armor through hell & back.. it has really upheld very well. No ripped mesh.. all the pads still stay in place and the elastic is still in great shape. Love the built in kidney belt! Comfortable and doesn't restrict movement and I've gone down many times and it's kept me from major injury every time. Sometimes I wear it under or over my jersey and even wear my Ogio Enduro vest over it with all my tools & supplies. I can't say enough about this jacket. I love it!

Ordered these after realizing I drove 159,XXX miles without doing the recommended 100,000 miles preventive maintenance. Exact fit! Cylinders #1 - #7 were easily removed. #8 took a little bit more time and multiple attempts but finally was able to wiggle it out.

I absolutely love this cover! It's a great alternative to anyone who's looking for something "outside the box" when it comes to winter storage.  I'm not a huge fan of car covers that sit on the car's painted surfaces, as taking them off and putting them on is literally just dragging all of the contaminants on the car across the paint every time you take it off or put it on.  The Car Capsule was the answer for me.The 16' model fit my 2010 Corvette convertible perfectly, and even has a good foot or so of extra room. The one thing that I insist on mentioning is that once it is fully inflated, it takes up more space than you think it will. As general rule of thumb, if it is already tight in your garage just parking the car itself, a car capsule will likely be too big for your garage. The good news is that creates a cushion of air around the car, so even if stuff bumps into the bubble or runs into it, it just bounces right off. Its just a little cumbersome to move around it if you need to get beside it while its inflated in a tight garage.It is inflated by a small 120mm high-speed fan which runs continuously and is basically a computer fan on steroids.  That is also how it is able to continuously exchange the air 4 to 5 times an hour...always compressing in fresh air.  The air is filtered though, keeping dust and other particles out of the bubble.  This also will all but completely eliminate moisture in the car, and makes the Car Capsule even more desirable if you plan to store your vehicle in an unheated space.  Remember, moisture is the real enemy when storing vehicles, as it gives way to rust and other issues down the road.  There is a hole near the fan assembly to route wires through for a battery float charger or other electronics that may also need plugged up during times of storage.  Lastly, for those wondering, using a Kill-A-Watt gauge, I found that running the fan 24/7 costs approximately $0.04 cents a day to run, or roughly $1.20 a month.It is an excellent means of storing your car if it will be for a lengthy period of time. However, if you plan to take it in and out of the capsule frequently, you may find it to be a little much. First time setting up takes a good half hour to 45 minutes, however once you know what you're doing it can be done in about 10 to 15 minutes with two people.In the end, the #1 selling point for me was this: Nothing, not even a cover, touches the car. Only air. What could be better for prized vehicle?Continues to oooh and ahhh everyone that sees it. Most people don't even know it exists. That's a shame too...the best storage option I've seen yet for longer term storages.UPDATE #1 - 8/27/15After 2 winters of storage, I still stand by my initial review.  Everything has held up very well, and nothing shows signs of wear.  This cover seems to be built for the long haul.  I've also included a few pictures from the last few years to give you an idea of the size.UPDATE #2 - 11/25/15Shortly after writing my last update listed above, I got the capsule out for storage this winter.  The fan was very sluggish, had a wobble to it and wasn't inflating the capsule completely, leaving it "mushy" or softer to touch.  A few days later I came out to discover that the fan had stopped completely.  Upon dis-assembly, I discovered that the bearing in the fan was almost completely seized up and made a grinding sound when trying to manually spin it.  Not so surprisingly, CarCapsule does offer a replacement fan, but it runs almost $60 with shipping, which I considered asinine for a $10, 120mm high speed fan.  I looked all the specs up on the fan that was supplied and found a suitable replacement that was near identical for approximately $11 on Amazon (Found here:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Swellder-Delta-AFB1212VHE-120mm-X-38mm-Very-High-Speed-cooling-Fan-2Pin-2-wire-Connector-148-CFM-NEW/dp/B00XDXHTFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Swellder Delta AFB1212VHE 120mm X 38mm Very High Speed cooling Fan 2Pin 2 wire Connector 148 CFM NEW</a>).  I simply cut the red/black wires from the fan, removed the old one, screwed the new one in, soldered the wires together, and presto...new life.  I will disclose that CarCapsule does consider the fan to be a consumable item with a life expectancy of 3-5 years.  Still, I was quite disappointed to have only gotten 10 months (total cumulative time with the fan running) out of the stock fan when I used it in a clean garage with a steady 45-70 degree temperature range.  However, I don't feel that a simple fan failure makes the product less desirable or speaks to the longevity or reliability of the actual product, and would still give it 5 stars.  Just keep in mind...the fan will, sooner or later, need replaced.Update #3 - 7/15/17Having used the CarCapsule for 4 winters now on 2 different cars (2010 Corvette convertible and 2013 427 Corvette convertible), I'm happy to report that it's still working great without any issues.  It's starting to accrue a film on the inside of the bubble that needs wiped out, but it only take 15 minutes to do so.  The new fan listed in the update above is still plugging along without any issues.  No signs of rips or tears and all of the sewn/mended sections have shown no signs of unraveling.  I've yet to take the car out of the capsule and find any issues with mildew, mold, rust, discoloration or any type of odors or smells.  It always comes out in the same shape I put it in.  Still a 5 star product, easy.

Attached to my review of this spare tire cover are four photos showing my tire in different stages of before and after. The tire size is 255 70R 16's at about 29.9 in diameter. As you can see by the pictures. The cover fits quite nicely albeit ever so slightly loose around the tread and is made of a thick like vinyl reinforced canvas that is quite pliable and durable.Overall I am pleased with the material and workmanship of the cover and suspect it to last for several years even being hung underneath my truck. Recommend.

Works well and adds some stability to the leveling arms. I bought an old pop up and immediately added these as it is easier than placing blocks when you level. As a side note these are somewhat custom so you may need to cut the rubber bushing to make it fit. Not hard at all. Also some have complained that the supplied screw is really small, but the way this is designed the screw is just to hold the plate on the foot when raising it. When the foot is down it puts its weight on the plate, not the screw.Also one of the arms on my popup was different as it was at one time replaced. Whoever replaced it didn't get it lined up fully and when the foot is down it sits at an angle (see photo). I don't think it will be a major problem as you virtually are never on level ground but it could eventually bend the footplate.

Bought this to replace the ALL FIT lip spoiler I had due to that one being to flimsy and starting to get ratty due to me getting to close to parking bumps and sidewalks to which I have learned my lesson in parking further back.I wanted something more durable and thick, and this seemed to fit the bill from the pictures and discription. When I received it, there was no doubt that it did fit the bill! Beautiful carbon fiber piece and heavier and more solid than the All Fit rubber.This comes with two sided tape as do all other lip spoilers, however these also came with some fender screws which was a nice touch- I think maybe 6 of them. I installed one on each corner where in my past experience is where these start to come up and lift. I did the usual in preparing first starting with purple degreaser, than scrubbed with alcohol. Let dry for awhile and then installed the spoiler with the 2 sided tape- and again ending with the fender screws to the ends on the sides.Fast forward a month later and the tape is starting to come off from multiple places. The pictures above (first 2) show the tape is actually separated from the bumper as well as its starting to come up off the piece itself. I will adhere another fender screw here to help keep it up - side note I have had to do this twice already AFTER the original install.In all the piece is great and very nice! ( last photo is of the lip shown from atop which looks great ) I don't think the company will survive very long if they keep using this tape. I do believe it was 3m, but obviously not the right bond strength.**** NOTE TO SELLER/OWNER AND OR MANUFACTURER***** GEt BETTER ASHESIVE TAPE AS THAT IS THE ONLY FLAW!ThanksJason

I really do like this bag. I got the roll bag. The size is just right for what I wanted it for, using for my fender rack, so I don't have to use my back pack anymore. I gave it four stars because I would have liked them to include two more mounting straps, as they only include two. I guess that doesn't take away from overall functionality, but I'll probably have to use zip ties to ensure it's more secure. Update: 11/12/16: I've upgraded my rating to 5 stars, and the strap issue is irrelevant. I played with the setup and found the 4 straps they include to hook the roll bag to another bag, work perfectly to secure it to my rack.

These are the cheapest set of lights anyone can buy. <--- everything in that sentence I mean literally and figuratively. There are rarely any places where you can buy a 2 sets of working headlights for less than 10$. That being said they are cheap. The light output is less than my stock halogen bulbs. The casting of light is diffused and splotchy. And the worst part is that these light aren't super bright white. They are "Not so bright tint of blue white light". Buuut for less than 10$ I give them a 3.5 star. If you're debating to buy these just buy them and if you don't likem keep them for emergency backup.I am using the 9006 for fog light and the 9005 for DRL/high beam.In the photo I have the 9006 in the bottom left. The picture doesn't show the slight blue tint but it's there. You can see the cast of the bulb compared to the bottom right.Again $10...just buy them and try them out!

These DO NOT fit out of the box on a 2010 Mazda 3. That said, I did install them and they seem good so far. There is a longer spacer on the bottom of these shocks that prevent you from threading the bottom bolt. I took a hack saw to it and cut off a big enough chunk to thread the bolt just fine. See pictures. I included the stock shock as comparison.

I have loved Chamberlain's Leather Milk products since I first tried their #1 product. When I saw the promotional offer for the Water Protectant I had to get it and put it to the test on my hubby's leather work boots.I rubbed some of the water protectant #3 onto the top of the boot, as that is where it seems to always get wet, from rain or just walking in the wet grass.I used some of the #3 leather milk and amazingly it really darkened up the top of the boot showing me the protection. Made them look hydrated and new again. As you can see his boots have really faded out.These products are fabulous! I love each and everyone that I have!The leather milk does not smell chemical based like alot of leather cleaners/polishers/waterproofers. And it leaves my hands so soft after using. I love how they send you a new cleaning pad with each product.And as you read the back of the products, you will find a bit of humor in each label! Great company, great products! Highly recommend!!

Haven't had to use it yet, thank the good Lord.Goes on a keychain really well, not too cumbersome to carry around in a pocket. I was worried that the black piece (which has the key-ring) would come loose from the main piece over time ... but nope. Still looks good and I trust it will work if I ever need it.

Light out put is decent, brighter than the original incandescent bulbs. As a plus, no "light out indicator". However, the color of the LED are not Amber as advertised, they look more warm white to yellow, looks somewhat similar to the color of a clear incandescent bulb. If your vehicle has Amber light housing than the color may not be an issue. I decided to return the bulb. I did order these bulbs in red and did like them and kept them.

I got a good work out applying 2 coats by hand and it feels like I barely used any of the 9oz of wax. I used to use the 845 formula of the collinite brand and it lasts anywhere from 3-4 months. After my bottle of 845 dried up I wanted to try 476. Visually the 845 insulator wax is only slightly better with 1 coat. 845 has wetter shine IMO, I know appearance is subjective and there may be variables that I need to take into account such as age and condition of my paint since the last time I waxed . The reason I did 2 coats is because I was able to get a deeper wet gloss and It assures me that I have as close to 100% coverage as humanly possible. After 2 coats I love the way it looks. I will see how this wax fairs the california sun and dust due to the dro0ught and comment on its durability at a later date but am optimistic because collinite themselves say this is more durable than 845 (lasted approx 4-5 months). If you have a large carlike a wagon, SUV or truck I would recommend 845 for the convenience factor.Pros:Protection from the elementsWarm carnauba  gloss9oz can lasts a very long timeRemarkable price for the qualityConCar needs to be cleaned with pre-wax cleaner (Polishes work too) and Clay bar recommendedAfter hazing the wax is more difficult to remove than average waxes- water spritz or breath fogging helps remove the wax- use a detailing micro fiber towel.Tin is cool but doesn't seem air tight. Tin will be stored in a ziplock bag

I haven't rode with the jacket yet so this will be based on fitment and quality. I tried on a lot of jackets, I'm a big ole boy and finding normal clothes is hard let alone specialty stuff. After other reviews and measuring and trying on jackets, this jacket is what they say it is. Due to others being to small in a 3x I decided to order the 4X. When I got it, man was it huge but it was what they said it was. So I sent it back and got the 3X like I should have done to begin with. The 3X fits almost 100% perfectly. Where it doesn't fit is in the collar, but that because I have a short fat neck so I don't blame this on Joe Rocket at all. The fit and finish is spectacular all the way around. Sleeve length, torso length, chest and waist are all perfect for me. The ventilation with the jacket works great with me standing in front of a fan, you can feel the air moving through the jacket and out the back just like they designed it to do but that is with a fan and not running down the road. The removable liner is great and easily comes in and out. The liner does naturally tighten up the jacket but that will help keep your body warm. All the zippers are easy to work while wearing gloves because they put big pull tabs on them.So far I'm very happy with the jacket all around. Now I can't wait to get on the road with it!!!!!!

Just installed these on my 2007 Wrangler Unlimited (2AUG16). They look great and are made out of a sturdy metal. I almost didn't give a five star rating for a couple of reasons. 1. The spacers are white. In my opinion, they should be black to match the trim or red to match the tail light. I spray painted them black. 2. The provided screws were plenty long enough but my tail lights had two different diameter screws. The screws in the shallow (inside) part of the tail light are smaller since they screw into a retaining clip. The screws provided with this set worked but required quite a bit of torque to "resize" the retaining clip. They look great and the white back-up light does NOT show through the flag portion as seen in the seller's photo. Even with the two minor issues, I would still buy these again.

Awesome gauge. Installed in my 99 Runner via the T option as close to my out pipe as possible. Easy installation with clear instructions. Tells you not only where your wires go but why they need to go there, makes improving a breeze. It only took me about a hour and that's with rigging the included mount to fit a little "cubby" in my dash. The gauge glows well in the daylight, about as bright as my stereo controls, without being obnoxious at night and the 30% dimmer with my headlights is nice. It can be set to hold each color constantly (there's even a constant hot wire so it remembers your setting when keyed off) as well as a 3 second hold on each color with a instant change to the next and a gradual scrolling as well. All and all I'm very happy with the gauge. I'm likely to buy the oil gauges as well.

This review is 12 hours after installation, I will update if need be down the road...I was pleasantly surprised, Install took about 5 minutes by myself. I do not care for the fit as far as how the coverage is in places. The Tailgate on my 2014 GMC Sierra Z71 Texas Edition 4X4 has a curve at the tailgate and I would have liked to see the topper stay with those lines. But the cost of this item offsets my dislikes. Seems to be built fairly well. I have got to remember not to lock my tailgate because if a thief thinks I am hiding something in the bed of my truck a quick slice with a blade and my topper is gone. The lock downs seem a bit flimsy but its not like they have hundreds of pounds to secure, the topper is pretty light weight but sturdy.

This is a great pulley that replaced my OEM Honda Accord Pulley that was squeeking at startup. The OEM pulley has an NSK Japan bearing in it and this one has a NTN Canada bearing in it. Do your homework, NSK is the largest supplier of bearings in Japan with NTN a close second. The NTN bearing is just as good as the NSK at a fraction of the price. Car idles better and runs smoother now. 2006 Accord 2.4L

The style and fit of these goggles are near perfect at a fantastic price point!!  I use them for my motorcycle and they feel great.  I haven't had any fogging issues and they have been protective for their intended use.  I haven't had any debris or dust find its way into my eyes through the ventilation system so far, but I don't ride with them on a daily basis.  The foam liners work well for comfort, but will probably wear out quickly.  If they ever make an upgraded version priced higher with refined quality and some minor improvements, I would purchase it as well.

Product was well-made. Installation was pretty easy. I did not notice any gains in horsepower or torque.  I don't know about fuel economy because I haven't driven it enough.  Only giving it two stars because it's quality made, made in USA and it was easy to install.  This was installed on a 2000 Chevy Silverado 4x4 with a 5.3 L.  The brackets that come with the throttlebody spacer to relocate the throttle linkage make it difficult to install. The bolts actually hit the intake manifold.  I also had to cut a small amount of material from my fan shroud. Don't really notice any whistle noise, just a slight noise at about 1600 RPM.

I received a moderately USED jack that showed significant evidence of prior usage including heavy scratching in the area that actually comes into contact with the vehicle.  There was also significant grease with debris in the grease on both ends of the jack.The first tip off was that the product's box showed significant abuse and was damaged in numerous areas and the shipping box was undamaged.

My husband loves it when I surprise him with new useful toys for our vehicle.  Of course I have to keep color and style in mind and if it benefits us.  We both use seatbelt extenders and at times I find myself holding onto the seatbelt to stop it from being a little uncomfortable.  I had in mind to get a pair of these to prevent that.  Not only that they also protect your white clothes from grimy seat belts.  These are easily removed, washed and replaced.Being Australian, when I see something that says 'sheepskin'  I believe that means that there is an actual skin involved as there is with many genuine Australian sheep skin items, moccasins come to mind, saddle blankets I used to have made for my show horses, even car seat covers.  I think that is where there is come confusion.  These are wool or the fur of the sheep, no skin involved.  It has a material backing and a strip of male and female velcro attached to adhere it in place.  The edges are bound in color co-ordinating binding.These fit our 96 Yukon perfectly in color and size and are very comfortable when in use.I received this item complementary for in home testing and evaluation purposes in exchange for my honest review

Be prepared to spend some time doing the front flares. The quality of the finish is great. All the holes will line up but only with a lot of manipulation, two people are better than one. There is a recess on the inner flare providing room for the hood latch, even an aftermarket one. Other than basic tools I used a sawzall, dremel grinder and a drill. The directions provided are "grainy" at best and too dark, just go to ( www.bushwacker.com-sites-default-files-product-instructions ) where the directions are terrific. They come out from the side at least 2+ inches further than stock flares. Don't lose any of the supplied hardware or be prepared to drive to the hardware store,( there are no extras ). I am very pleased with the finished product.

I took a shot on the Slick Mist Tire and Trim Shine by Lucas Oil. Over the years, I converted from Armour All to Meguiar's then back to Armour All including some dabbling with Eagle One and a few other manufacturer's of "tire shines." I use Lucas lubricants, and oil and fuel treatment products religiously and have never had anything but glowing success so why not try their care car stuff?During summer months, I am accustomed to getting about 3-4 days of decent performance out of tire treatments due to hot, humid climate, lots of evening and overnight rain and 85-100 miles of daily driving. I have now used Slick Mist on four different cars. It is a good consistency- thick enough to hang on to the applicator and "build" on the tires, but not goopy and gummy.  It seems to absorb just enough- not laying on the surface and not disappearing into the land o'molecular structure- even in hot, direct sun. It looks great, in my opinion. On tires, it is not overly shiny, so if you like the glossy, wet look, choose another product. The Slick Mist (applied per directions), leaves a smooth, satiny look. On even really chalky, faded, oxidized plastic, the black comes back and stays back. The Slick Mist does not streak and splotch like other products I have used on the same surfaces. And, most importantly- I get 8-10 days of great looking rubber (a little less on hard plastics).As an informal, unintentional, and very unscientific test, the first time I used it (about a month ago) I got overspray on my asphalt driveway. Those spots have been in the beating sun, driving rain... have had some heated basketball played on them, tons of tires rolled over them and they persist-  two big overspray spots, clear as day. Tempting to do the whole driveway to see if it holds up better than traditional seal coating!A month of use and wear on all four vehicles and I am amazed at how well blacks stayed black.  Unless Lucas reformulates for the worse or my tires suddenly disintegrate (for which I would update my post!), I will never use anything else on my tires or exterior plastic/rubber. I was surprised and remain 100% pleased.****UPDATE (August 2015)---  I have attached photos of one of my vehicles (a 15 year-old truck) after THREE weeks of rain and shine with absolutely no re-touching on rubber/plastic. You can hopefully see that the tires look great and most of the plastic does as well.  There are the typical, white'ish "silicone" streaks on the front bumper cover and the rear mud guards are a bit streaky, but I am absolutely AMAZED at how well this stuff is holding up.

Love the product!! Looks great!! So bright!! Great deal! I bought this for my 2017 softail!! Great seller!! They'll make sure you're happy with the product!! Fast delivery!! I installed it myself and Im no expert! Like one buyer said, the blue wire that connects the light needs to be connected to the wire thats coming from the bike with a wire slicer inorder the halo to work!!

just got the bag today and put it on and I dig it. It fits very well on my 2012 klr 650. Only issue is there's no really good points to mount the straps closest to you. I decided to loop it around the forward mount for the side panels you have to remove to remove the seat. Less storage than I imagined but it's just because of the klr's tank shape. Fits a decent amount for just riding around and has a nifty little pocket for your documents, tire pressure gauge, etc. and I can say the iPhone 6s Plus with a lifeproof case fits perfectly in the gps pocket. Excellent buy. Highly recommended.

Love the light bar. I have it installed on the bed cover of my 2003 Chevy 2500HD and has been there for several months. The light is extremely bright and has gone through a car was almost every day of its life on the truck. Still no issues, no leaks, nothing wrong with it. Very happy with the price and the quality.

These lights are really bright and put off a nice white light. I installed them in my Nissan Titan next to another brand LED and you could definitely see see how much brighter they were.Now the down side I know this sounds strange but I began to notice my remote that opens my doors wouldnt work when the lights were on so I removed them and guess what it started opening the doors again. I did some research and this isn't that uncommon for some LEDs to interfere with the vehicles transmitter.

Haven't cleaned my tires in about a year. Sprained the product and within minutes most of the dirt/brake dust was dripping off. I used the product three times the first week. I did not scrub or worked-in the sonax. I just let it do its job and then rinsed it off.

So far so good! I have a 2017 Honda Grom with a Pro Taper Honda Mini 7/8 handlebar. These fit great with the smaller of the two inserts and the fastener/bolt. For 13 dollars I am impressed and they are cheap to replace if anything happens to them like people have said.

These were purchased to use for generator gas during hurricane season in FL.  I hate the gov. mandated crappy gas cans that take 15 mins to pour out 5 gallons.So far I'm not a big fan of these jugs.  They are very thin.  I leak tested them with water and I know the bottoms don't leak.  Hopefully using gas won't be any different.  I ordered 2 green and 2 silver at the same time.  Two days later I received a purple one by itself, in no box, with a shipping label wrapped around the handle.  The sticker on the side of the jug even says green on it, but you could clearly see it was put over a label that says purple.  Not sure what happened here.Noticed my account said all items delivered.  Contacted the seller and he said I need to wait to see if the others arrive and are the right color.  That's completely understandable.  The others arrived boxed, and well I might add, and were the correct colors.Due to all the bad reviews about leaky jugs I decided I may be lucky to have received 4 that don't leak so I decided to keep the purple one, even though I really don't like the color.It's just not worth my time of sending it back, waiting for the next one, etc.I think next time I will spend a little more and buy the scribner plastics jugs instead.

For the most part i am happy, the only complaint I have is; the "DOME" light for the 2002 Accord is to short.  It barely fits and after a ride on a bumpy road it comes loose. I wonder if the correct item was placed in the package (SEE ATTACHED PHOTO).Also the trunk light is too long and hits the trunk light cover, SO since I was sent 2 license plate lights and only have a spot for 1 I used the other in the trunk light position, works fine and no interference. Make those 2 corrections and it is an awesome product and value.

I personally like this better than other brands. Ok, I'm lying I can't tell the difference. I just like this because it's less expensive and goes on sale more often than other brands. But honestly, I don't know if it's my butt-dyno that's telling me or something psychological, but this oil makes my shifts much more smoother. What's the saying? Don't fix what's not broken? I'm happy with the results, and I'm going to stick with the Castrol Power line for my bikes.

My daughter is addicted to watching these videos, so we made one.. #Shopkins #MLP  #SurpriseEggs @MyLittlePonyI hoped these would be bright but had no idea at how bright they really are. WOW!  I swapped out my halogen reverse lights on my 2015 F150 with these and it made a huge difference. At night, It almost appears like daytime in my backup camera when I backup now. Crazy Bright!  I highly recommend these.  So easy to install too!  I made a video on YouTube. Check it out here.  https://youtu.be/Xvo0bH6WEN0You can see before and after in the video!Bottom line. If you want bright backup lights, BUY THESE!I bought these, and this is my honest review.  A lot of reviews are from people that say they got them free.  I actually bought these and still think they are great.

Phx, AZ Extreme Heat And Dust Prone Area.I like this product due to its price and quality. Major Brands are typically a little better made. Examples in pictures,#1 Major brand will Typically have 3 beads (lines) of glue (increase durability).#2 It Seems like the beads of glue are short by a pleat or two.#3 The Top Seal Is Exactly The Same. No DifferenceOverall... I change my air filters every 8,000 to 10,000 miles due to harsh conditions. Box is labeled for every 12,000 miles. Oil comes out clean and no difference in performance between major brands.

very inexpensive from Amazon. Used on RF axle of my 09 GMC. The job looks intimidating, this was my first time doing it. I had the axle tube out in under 45 mins. Replaced the seal and had it back together in less than 2 hrs. and that was while using a floor jack. Saved over 600 bucks doing it myself .

Just received this product and went to work on my 2017 Ford F350 SuperDuty. It was car wash clean but had tar all over from some recent road work and also some film from the tire brightners they used at the car wash. Icky stuff. It took me about an hour to go over all 40 acres of my giant truck but the results were fairly impressive. Im going to try it on my motorcycles next. Id try it on my lear jet but I don't have one...so, ya...thats a problem.

Bumper looks great!!! Box was beat up but no scratches on the bumper itself.  Smittybilt sends horrible installation instructions but the 6 bolts and 4 nuts necessary to install it is pretty simple to figure out.  My only issue was that only one of the bottom bolt holes came drilled out.  I had to drill the other through the bumper into the frame.  OEM fog lights mounted perfectly!

I seldom find products worthy of 5 stars but this one is. I don't even need to try them to give them the rating. I received them in a package that had them bent into a horse shoe shape, I thought they were broken. Turns out these things are unbelievably flexible. After warming up they bent right back to a straight position. They almost have a lead like flexibility to them. You can't go wrong with these.

Great Dielectric grease for electrical connections.  Just the right thickness so it won't run off but still flows nicely.  I bought this can over a typical tube because I thought it might be easier to store cleanly and be ready to use when needed.  Not really the case, since the applicator tip stores next to the cap and is full of grease.  I don't understand why, with just a little more thought, a more sanitary applicator setup could be provided with these grease products.  I ended up designing my own tip applicator and made one with my 3D printer that works perfectly and remains on the tip at all times and stores under the factory cap.  Now I'm really happy with my new grease!  Maybe these guys will do something like this for the rest of you some day.

This is my preferred style of sunshade.  I bought a similar one back in 2003 with my older car, and it was time to find a new one.  I looked for a long time for one that wasn't connected and finally found these.  They work great on my 2013 F-150 truck.  They are big enough that I don't have to flip down my visor (they just lodge between the mirror and roof). Very easy to install and take down.  I use them on a daily basis to protect my interior from the sun and heat.  They also keep my truck a lot cooler than when I don't use them.  My last pair I got over 10 years of use out of them.These are listed at 31" x 38" per panel.  I would highly recommend these to anyone with a medium to large vehicle.

Love this! Perfect for pranking my neghbor that covered my car windows with stickers from the local pizza place. I was laughing so hard I had to send my kid across the street to put this on his truck because he would have heard me. Went out this morning and didn't find it on any of my cars, so I am sure he drove to work with this still attached. Cannot wait until he finds it. Prank war is ON.About the magnet, holds tight, tested it on my own car first and looks great. I will buy more of these, because this is only going to escalate now.

Love the look of it, but the construction is lacking, stitching comes loose and the trim comes loose of the inner edges.  Pretty much that way with any multi part cover after some use.  Only thing to fix it is to cut away the inner trim as it comes loose then the rest of it falls apart or wrap it up with tape, covering the design I paid for seeing anyway.  Would be fine for your collector car more than a daily driver.

Product fits and worked perfectly...For 1 year and 10 months....  Then bottom tube section of the telescoping mast rusted and stopped sliding out of the hole and the motor pushed the rest of the mast out! The white cable part is fine and motor is fine. Will be replacing with another model with longer warranty. Hope for best. Still much cheaper than OEM antenna.Videos on UTube help augment instructions that come with it.

I bought the cover because it looked good and I thought it was good quality. It's already got a string sticking out after 3 days, keep in mind this is a brand new product. If I wanted some cheap quality product that was made in China then I would have gone to Walmart or dollar store. I am very disappointed with this awful purchase.

Fits and works great. Doesn't lift off your head at speed. I find the visor of little use, it tends to hit the bridge of your nose at times. The pit boss does not work well with goggles, the strap tends to sit too high or too low in the back which pulls the goggle too high or low. Motorcycle glasses work much better.Worked flawlessly in a 30mph lay down crash. Did not feel any impact but could hear it scraping against the pavement. The ear flaps did not scrape. Very tough, thought it would have shown more damage.

This is my favorite towel that I use to dry my car. This cloth is very gentle on the car paint and it absorbs an insane amount of water. It leaves no streaks, no watermarks and no lint! What I do is I run the cloth over an area and then wring out the excess water and the cloth is ready to dry the next area. I always do the windows first to avoid the water drying and leaving watermarks. I leave the towel semi-wet and store it in the container. This super-absorbent car drying & cleaning chamois is amazing, you need to try it to understand how nice it is. This works better than any microfiber cloths out there (that do tend to leave lint) and also squeegees. You can use this towel over and over again and it still retains the same amount of absorption.I received this product at a discounted price to evaluate and provide an unbiased review.

I have seen a lot of people wearing something similar to this, and I just think that it is the coolest looking bandanna ever!!! I was really excited that not only do you get one, but you get two, so one for you and one for your rider! And even if you don't ride a motorcycle, this can be used as an actual bandanna, wrap it around your wrist, or use it as a headband, you are bound to get some interesting looks no matter how you wear it. I absolutely love this.I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.

I used the 14" fan in my Dodge Ram SRT-10 as a puller on the A/C condenser due to the air conditioning not getting cold enough, especially at idle, despite full R-134a charge. It fit perfectly between the condenser and the radiator. I didn't want it visible through the grille and puller fans are more effective. I'm finally getting 40 degree air from the vents! Air is about 7 degrees colder at idle. I wired it with a SPDT 30amp relay with the purpose of having the fan only run when the compressor clutch is engaged, which means it will not run when A/C is off or at wide open throttle. The relay connections I used: post 30 - positive battery terminal (with 15amp in line fuse), post 85 - chassis ground, post 86 - ran wire to positive (blue/yellow) wire from compressor clutch harness and soldered a T-tap connection, post 87 - positive fan wire, post 87a - is not used.  Ground wire from fan goes to a separate chassis ground. I used 14ga wire with PET sleeving. The little money spent on this project went a long way!

Intrigued for some time about this device, I recently purchased and I'm happy that I did.  I think it has helped change my driving habits a little over the past several months since I've had it. The thing that surprised me the most though we're the monthly analytic reports that are provided. Each month provides a new fresh look at your driving stats.  Also, I like the safety aspect that if I'm involved in an accident it can make a call for me. Works well with my iPhone 6+. Very simple to install and I almost forget it is there until it beeps at me for stopping to quickly. Also nice to know that my vehicle is getting slightly higher gas mileage than other vehicles like mine.

I bought this because i needed to put a aftermarket stereo inside my Honda fit because the stock ones display died. It took lots of time making sure that it fit my double din stereo but it looks nice.The only gripe i have about this product is that it doesn't sit as flush to the dash as the stock one did. It kinda sags in some spots but its no biggy to me since im the only one who really sees it and knows about it.I did have to use a dremel tool or heat gun to melt away some of the plastic that was left over when trying to cut away the option to use the single or double din choice. but with some finesse the stereo sits flush inside and doesn't move at all. I am very happy i purchased this item

UPDATE:The wife's car started scraping again, so upon inspection we found that 5 of the 8 had fallen out at some point.We ordered another set. Only this time, I drilled holes through them, ran zip ties through them, and zip tied them to the springs. They shouldn't go anywhere now.  I recommend doing the same. See attached pic.Original post:Used these to lift a 2012 civic hybrid that wouldn't get into the garage without scraping under the middle of the car. The spacers lifted it about 1.25", and didn't change the ride quality that much.THESE ARE DESIGNED TO USE 2 PER SPRING, OTHERWISE THERE WILL BE TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON ONE, AND THEY'LL SPLIT (like other people's complaints). If you use them correctly, they work fine. Order 2 sets.

Don't waste your money, this stuff is useless, no power, maybe okay for shining already perfect chrome, but this stuff takes no rust out and it doesn't revive dull metal either............. If you dealing with chrome / alloy rust issue, here is what you need to understand. Rust starts as a stain on top of the surface, at which point good chemicals, not this stuff, might help you clean up the rusty stain with some elbow grease. But if the rust fungus got so severe that ate up the thin film of chrome paint or penetrated the surface of alloy metal and created holes on the surface, then none of these metals will work or do nothing............... In the case of chrome, you will have to sand it down and have the chrome repainted. In the case of alloy metal, you will have to sand it deep enough to even out the rust holes with the surface again, a big job............... If you don't mind the imperfections on the surfaces, you can clean up most of the rust with steel wool 0000 grade and just plain water, wet the wool and rub it in and you see the rust run away................. Once you clean the rust, wet sand the surface with 2000 grade sand paper to smooth everything out. Now you can use a good chemical polisher to bring back the shine. Or better yet, paint it all black like I did, I cleaned everything the best I could and sand it enough to give me a good painting surface, then I painted everything black.

I have added two of these gadgets onto my car.One sits on a heated plastic fuel line right before the fuel injector rail (My car lacks the cold fuel line in the engine compartment) and the other sits on the return PCV line after the custom-built PCV fuel vaporizer. Fuel savings are quite impressive - 15%-20% and the engine temperature is much lower than without magnets.

Very light tint. No indication what side is the sticky (It's the outer side of the roll; no wonder I couldn't get it to stick). Don't waste your money on this product. Has some very basic instructions. You will need a heat gun, two free hands and best to apply with taillight on car. Look elsewhere and get it done professionally. I have attached a picture showing a taillight WITHOUT and WITH tint film. In to garbage!UPDATE:Used this on my 2nd Gen Kia Soul's  reflector lights and worked out well. Single layer was good enough to dim. Seems like on larger serfaces (eg taillight) better off with darker tint. Will have to test.

Used this to glue a sandpaper sheet to a terry cloth pad on my buffer so I could use it as a sander.  Bad idea, but the sandpaper held on very good for the orbital sander.  That takes some strength from glue.  A little got on my hand but I washed it off right away.  Was pretty easy to mix and dried in about 4 minutes.  Very good stuff for the price.  I use this over super glue because I think it holds way better.

Defective.  At first I assumed the fault was with another part of the 4x4 system after installing this solenoid, so I spent 2 hours diagnosing all other systems.  Did not expect a new part to be faulty.  Nope.  Wasted hours under the hood.  If you order this solenoid, test it before you install it.  Save yourself some time.

I will say I notice a difference in the chassis, the steering is much tighter and cornering is also tighter, lessening cab roll.  It was a tight fit on the passenger side of my 94 Accord Ex.  There is a bracket with a set of different wiring harnesses that go to various places.  I had to remove the bracket (8mm socket I believe) to put this one.  It requires a 14mm socket ( I wouldn't use a wrench) to install.  Also an adjustable wrench is needed to tighten the nuts on the bar itself.  Easy install, took like 40 min and only because of the wiring harness bracket had to remove.  It's more likely a 15 min job.

Item showed up as promised, when attempting to install to the light tabs I have that are 23" apart, & found out the description on this item is WRONG IT says the light is 24" wide physically when it fact it's only 22" I bought this light specifically based on the sliding mounts, measured the tabs and knew a 24" would fit perfectly.  Really irritatedEdit: contacted the manufacturer they promised to refund half the purchase price, it still has yet to have happened, don't buy if you need a 24" look at the pics

A very simple and effective solution. I installed this on a 2015 Tundra with a B&W Tow & Stow receiver hitch. I did have to shorten the bracket by about .75" to clear a flange that is present on the Tundra (see photo). Not hard to do with the right tools. Then I just sprayed a nice coat of black paint on the cut and good to go. The alternative to this would have been to install the tightener upside down. I was reluctant to do this because then  I would be placing a load on the bracket whenever I towed rather that simply using it to hold the hitch down tightly. (though I'm sure it's plenty strong enough). The only negative is that if you are using this with a tow & stow it will keep you from placing the hitch in the stow position. I never do that so I really don't care. Unless of course you install it upside down as mentioned. All in all this is a nice product and worth the money. And I now have a nice quiet hitch with no slop.

When I saw these, I just had to get them for my new F250!  They were pretty easy to put in with the provided self-drill screws.  My only complaint is not that you can't really see the one on the passenger side, but that's the fault of the huge muffler on the truck.  Love how they look though.

Battery Tender changed the design of this charger and Amazon is showing the old design in their photo.  This is now the newer "High Efficiency" model.  I just called Battery Tender and spoke to a tech who confirmed that there is no difference between this model and the 022-0192 High Efficiency model, which could have been purchased on ebay for $21.99 w/free shipping and no tax.  I've got four of the old 021-0123 chargers; they've all worked great for years w/out issue and I really wanted another one, as shown in Amazon's listing.

I purchased six months ago, but only used three times.  The head came off the handle on the third use.  The handle is attached by flimsy plastic pins. See photos. In an attempt to reattach the handle the pin poked a hole in the head which is thin plastic.  See photo.  I did manage to get the head reattached.  It does not hold up well when soaked with water adding the extra weight.  No excessive force was used, just the minimum to wash a vehicle.  This junk would function better as a duster for hard to reach places.

These wheels look great on my truck, however the center caps are already rusting. Purchased in Oct of 2017. (BTW I wash the truck 2 times a month)The wheels themselves do not show any signs of rust, just the centers. If you purchase these wheels  ask for the plastic center caps with the Chrome coating if you can get them. They will not replace them,they simply refer you to the manufacturer and we all know how that goes..... I went ahead and bought new plastic centers but it ended up costing me $58 no refunds from seller or amazon

Dealer wants $400+, Autozone $250, Summit Racing $200. Purchased TWO for $240 ($120/ea) and they are of top notch quality. You cannot go wrong with Timken bearings. They come as a single assembly, ready to install. Just make sure you clean out the knuckle, use some anti seize on the walls of the knuckle and coat the axle spindle with bearing grease (as well as the back and inside of the Timken assembly). Took me about 1 hr per side. I could have done it faster if I wasn't wasting time drilling out the brake rotor locking bolt.

Grease fittings on automobiles have disappeared so, grease guns have declined in popularity. But, I have a utility trailer, a riding mower, a tractor and 40 ft. motorhome and all have Zerk grease fittings everywhere.I was considering a pneumatic grease gun but, you've got to be connected to an air hose so, I chose this model. Very good quality, easy to operate and has the feature of pressure vs. volume setting. Only comment is the instructions are brief but, if you've got a tractor, you know how these things operate. This will go into my tractor tool collection and get frequent use.Now, I've got to decide on the grease to use.

Purchased these last year for my ATV. I must say I love them. I used some PIAA handlebar mounts to place them. They are very wide beam and work great on the handlebars as they turn with the bar. When I am out at night with these I can see everything in front of me.On a side note. I purchased the 12 inch bar for the front of the quad also. That allows me to see way out when I am running in a straight line at speed.

Poor quality finish work. Weld on front of step (flat end that the cap for the hitch bar) was not ground smooth but left an uneven edge. Weld on bottom of hitch bar was not even done which allows water to enter the hitch tube. Weight on tongue sticker says only 350# not 500# like advertised. Also hitch bar is hollow stock and at this price point should be solid. Gen-Y needs to spend less time on emblazoning the step with their logo and more time on finish work. I would be embarrassed to have our company logo on this thing.

I was happy to discover that Amazon stocked the gold bottle 10w60 Castrol TWS because that's all my garage queen E46 M3 has ever consumed and her yearly oil change is due. "Saves me a trip to the BMW $tealership or a non-Prime online order from elsewhere" I remember saying to myself.I was less happy with what showed up two days later, namely a half-dozen bottles of Castrol 10w60 that were bronze colored and called EDGE SUPERCAR WITH TITANIUM FIST or similar. Upon checking the label it does appear to be made in Austria like the old stuff and does appear to have all the correct approvals/recommendations. (It's apparently also fine in my Koenigsegg which is great, I mostly drive that to keep the miles off the E46.)That said, not sure if same enough to risk for the next year in an S54 that does occasionally get run hard. Haven't decided yet, might return this and see what I can find elsewhere. Unless someone can tell me for sure that it's the same.5 stars in the meantime because I suspect I'm worried about absolutely nothing, and that it's correct, and a great product.

Housing is put on the same for driver and passenger side, thus you will have to stretch the passenger side wiring to make the socket fit.Instead of the base of the socket pointing inward towards the engine like stock, it will now point to the fender. If you don't have enough slack, you may be splicing in an extension wire.

For the price, this is a good deal.  I use it on my 2015 Harley Street Glide.  I had to buy the luggage mount to actually mount it to the bike.  It's a universal fit product, so there are no preset holes for mounting, you drill your own, but if your a DIYer, its not hard.  I bought high reflective tape to give it some reflection at night.  The seat seems sturdy for your passenger to enjoy.  It's a good trunk if you need the extra space, and don't want to spend $1000 on a Harley made one.  I like it, and would recommend it.

Perfect fit! Installed these on my 2004 F150 Lariat 4x4 after my factory springs broke. Common problem on F150's by the way... Anyway, these were direct bolt-on replacements. Took me about 1.5 hours start to finish. The ride quality is actually better than the factory units, but my factory units were broken, so... Either way, very happy with this purchase. Less than $200 for both units shipped! That beats ANY local auto parts shops in my area by at least $100. A couple of local shops quoted me $650 labor to replace them! Ford dealer wanted $800!!!  I completed the job myself with some basic tools and a little elbow grease and saved myself roughly $500. Very happy with my purchase... I am about to buy a set for the rear too.

This was a perfect fit on a 2002 Crown Vic. It works like the original part with no obvious sound difference or starting experience. The cost was less than half a similar retail refurb. The shipping was efficient and fast, arriving a day sooner than promised and the starter was well packed in spray foam in plastic wrap. The starter looks very sturdy and well machined. Be aware that the top bolt is nearly impossible to ever replace again. The outside bolt has to be accessed through the wheel well with about 18-24" ratchet extensions and at least one u-joint. I had to remove part of the fender well material that covers the upper control arm and thread the extension bar across the frame cross member.

These seat covers are very vibrant and will transform your boring old ride into something to feel good about. I had a small problem with a seam that came undone and the seller imiediatly sent me what I needed no problems no hassle. I was really impressed because I have never had anyone so this for me before. The seller stands behind their  product and is easy to work with. These seat covers look great and my car looks way better! I'm really glad I picked these. I removed my non removeable headrests by removeing the factory seat covers enough to take the permanent clips out, you can do it if you just try, fits not really hard at all of you take your time with it.  And then bam! Perfect fit. I highly recommend these seat covers and especially this seller for outstanding above and beyond great customer service! I'm trying to add photos but having trouble uploading them, I will keep trying. These seat covers look awesome, seriously before my car intierior was just all gray and boring. If you are trying to sell a car buy these and raise the selling price of the car that your selling them but yourself another set. Seriously they look great! I'm going to probably but another set for my truck soon. Great product for looks and comfort! Outstanding seller to customer service! Very happy with this seat cover set. It's a great deal!

I really enjoy this one and looked at a lot of helmets over the time and i picked this one. Fits great on my head I got a large like the chart said to pick. Fits nice not to tight and not to loose at all. i did not have a think wrong about my ears I have earrings in and they don't bother with it. I use earplugs when ridding to block out the wind. My neck dose not hurt anymore when i ride. With my old one it would push my head back some and after some time it starts to hurt. Not no more with the Crazy Al's. Its nice and soft to on the inside I don't know why anyone is saying it hurts with no padding it fits nice. I think a lot are not getting the right size my be thats why. But it did take a week to get here tho thats really the only thing what i would bitch about. My be could ship faster would be batter than anything. Came in a nice box to that i keep it in when its not on my head. The paint job is really nice and the rubber around the dome and the chin straps are nice to. I know its a lot of money tho but i really hated the mushroom head look so i wanted this. All and all I picked it up.

Original (see update below): Bought two sets of these lights and mounted them on a light bar in front of the bumper on my truck.  Just got everything wired up and installed and they are bright but they are NOT "4D Fish eye hyperspot lens" and do NOT look like the pictures posted.  If you are buying these based on the picture posted, you will be disappointed.  If you are buying them for the SPECIFICATIONS of the lights, then they will work fine.  I just got everything wired up yesterday evening and got them aimed properly.  I will update this review after a few months but so far, they work well for the money.UPDATE: Auxbeam realized their was an inventory mix up and corrected the issue. They sent me replacement lights with the 4D hyperspot lens and WOW! Beam pattern is not even comparable to the old ones. I thought the old ones were good but the beam pattern spread pretty wide for my intended use. These are like a laser in comparison.Just got them wired, installed, and preliminary aiming. The old lights were probably a 45 degree beam pattern. These are probably 25 or so and the beam pattern reach does what I wanted them for in the first place, reach out into the dark and light up as far as possible when driving offroad.Great job to auxbeam for reaching out to me and correcting the error this far after the purchase! Thanks again!Second Update: Almost a year later and they are still going strong.  The paint is flaking off in some areas on the front of the light but I check to make sure they still work and don't have any condensation inside at least a few times a month.  I can deal with some paint flaking as long as they still do their job.

This AF Sensor is for Bank 2 sensor 1 (driver side before the CAT). For me this one was for 2002 Rav4 4cyl. The old sensor lost its continuity in its heater circuit and needed to be replaced. The original sensor was by Toyota and had a short 4 wire cable. This one by Denso came in with much longer wires so got me little confused. For a second I thought that I got the sensor for the bank 1 as the bank 1 sensor comes with longer wires. I am not sure if it comes with longer wires just to accommodate more cars but sensor is sensor so I decided to just zip-tie the remaining length and use it. After install I cleared the code and took it for a drive. So far no code back. My old sensor was really shot, lol.

So this is actually the 5th replacement wiper order I had to do because the other 4 wiper blades (2 WERE DIFFERENT MODEL OF BOSCH) kept leaving this strange patch of streaked water across my line of vision... I started to think something was wrong with my car but I kept reminding myself nothing was wrong with my car because my old wiper was perfect and lasted me a year... I decided to keep returning and ordering replacement till finally I got one that was not defective. Some had a bulge in where the rubber glade mounted in so it caused the blade to not fit to the window properly, and some just had defects in the rubber like chunky jagged rubber as well as some sort of serial number that was where the blade meets the glass WHICH IS DANGEROUS AND COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT!Amazon really needs to look into this more because the return shipping is costing them a lot of loss so they really need to hold the supplier accountable for selling them with such garbage wipersIF YOU ORDER ANY BOSCH OR ANY WIPER FOR THAT MATTER, DO NOT SETTLE TILL YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.I have attached some pictures of some of the defects and examples how the wipers perform. the day time pics are of the 5th wiper I received that actually worked the way it was supposed to.

First the good. These small bags are just right for a 250cc bike.  They arrive very well packed and have a nice paint finish. They add great style to a bike (see user submitted photos above) and add needed extra carrying capacity.  The mounting brackets are truly sturdy affairs--about 3/16" thick welded steel.  That said, I don't know what they would bolt to--see the user submitted photos above for the bracket I fabricated.  Now for the bad. The key locks take some fiddling.  The hinges for the side doors are just ABS plastic extensions on the doors hooking to an ABS receiver on the bag--likely to break then you'll have to fabricate some sort of hinge affair.  There's an excellent chance that whatever you put inside will get wet.  There's a small lip above the door and a thin piece of rubber which doesn't contact the door so water can enter.  There are also two 5/8" holes in the bottom but they could be plugged.  For the truly ugly, those neat looking tail lights are just neat looking hunks of plastic. The chrome retainer is plastic and not meant to be removed.  It's also not gasketed so water could enter.  The bulbs are about useless 5 watt units (by comparison, stop/tail-light bulbs are typically 10 watt/21 watt).  Even more incredible, it is not possible to remove the bulb from the socket unless you first remove the plastic chrome retainer which you'll likely break (if not on the removal, on the re-insertion).Overall, these bags add high style at a reasonable price if you can make the mounting brackets and can deal with the likely water intrusion issue.  I ride on good days only and don't put anything in the bags that can't stand getting wet.  I searched and searched and found nothing else that was small enough for my bike and looked as good.  I would buy them again simply because they look so good and I have the skills and equipment to mount the bags.

Nicely built, comes in a pretty box - Who cares they DONT FIT 2002 F150 4.6L as advertised.They look like they fit, they look exactly like the factory.  They fit into the holes.  But the SPRING IS TOO SMALL.These little nightmares will ride on top of the spark plugs but not seat over them.  Truck will start - and even idle fine.  But once you start driving the random misfires will start under load.  The springs simply don't fit, not even close.LOOK AT THE PHOTOS, the dielectric grease is still intact after installation!!

Just my initial review.  Item just arrived, as you can see in my picture there is no SS Thimble from the factory at the anchor end of the line.  There is a hook, presumably stainless steel that is tied on.  I am not a knot expert, but it looks like a double overhand.  It's stamped "china" and that's it.  It's probably just fine.  Just wanted people to know it is not as pictured.

I'm giving 4 stars bc the headlights aren't 100% the same color. Both ballasts I'm using are innovited 55w ballasts. As you can see in the pic the left headlight is noticeably more yellow than the right and looks to be closer to the 5000k than 6000k. I do a lot of night driving and this is mildly annoying. Other than the color mis-match the lights are working fine so far.

Very easy install, worked very well and I don't have to hear about my wife's poor hands anymore! WIN WIN!I do recommend getting all 3 bolts started before tightening them down, as the frame did not seem thick enough to withstand much torque applied via bolts.

These are NOT acorn seat lug nuts.  OEM honda wheel use an acorn type rounded seat.  These are straight 60 degree cut.  Yes they will work but they are not the correct lug for a honda wheel.  See attached pic, it show a real honda acorn lug on the right and this one one the left.  It is clearly not an acorn seat.

Very bright light only complaint is on my 2012 Dodge Ram 3500 the would come on dim with the doors open or key on. With out acutely turning them on. But when turn on they are bright. But after a few minutes when I  turn them off they do turn everything off. Not sure if they are supposed to do that or not.  Very nice lights. And I left them in there because they don't run my battery dead. .

This review is for Duck Covers A1T232, which I bought with my own money. It's a sheer fabric but it keeps the pollen and dust at bay. My carport is open on 3 sides and situated just a few feet from an unpaved country road so my RAM 1500 Extended cab gets filthy going nowhere. Initially, the Duck Covers A1T232 didn't reach to cover both bumpers but the cloth has relaxed & protects bumper-to-bumper. Deployment & storage are relatively easy (Height & long arms are valuable assets, here.) and the stuff sack is plenty roomy. I fold in the mirrors and tie down the antenna to the passenger mirror.  I didn't care to try the antenna grommet.

These lug-nuts are very nice looking. They are a solid design, meaning that they are all one piece. I bought these to replace the capped type of design of a lug-nut. What the difference is, a solid type is just that, one piece.. or solid.. A capped type of design is a lugnut that is more like a standard lug-nut, that is open on both ends, but then a nice chrome looking cap is place over the top of it. The problem with that type of design is, over time, dirt, corrosion, etc can form or get under that "cap" and when it does, it makes the cap sort of like, bloat, in the center as it is pushes the cap outwards. When this happens, it can make it so that you can not get your socket, or lug-nut wrench on it like you should, and you may have a problem getting it off. Mine are starting to do this, and I can not even get the socket even half way on the lug-nut because of it.. Which means that they are not very likely to strip or round out, on the outside.. This type of design, or the solid design, does not have that problem, which is why I went with it.As for size, these were bought for a 2003 stratus. These, I would say are about 1/4" or so, taller then the factory ones. Since them being a bit higher will not hurt, I really do not care.These arrived, where all the lug-nuts were just put in a bag, and that bag was in the box that they show. These also use a standard, 19mm socket too.. The same size as what was already on my car.I tried these out, and the socket fits on it perfectly.. It slides right on and off of them. The finish is just about perfect. I say just about, because the only marking in it, is where the size is. They did put the size, stamped on the side of the lug-nut itself.. It is not in there very deep, and at a distance, you do not even notice it. You only notice it up close. The stamping are not in it very deep either. Also, this stamping is only on one side of the lug-nut.. 5 sides have no markings.. Personally, I am not really sure why they needed these stamping on them, but, whatever.. They still look a heck of a lot nicer then the ones on my car now.I checked the threads, and they are very well cut out. No rough edges, and full depth to the threads too. It went on to the stud very easily, and did not stick at all.Overall, I really have nothing bad to say about them. If anything, it would be nice if they sold these without the stamping on the side, but since it is in there lightly, and is not very noticeable, especially at a distance, I am not going to complain too much. Since no one has actually posted actual pictures of the lug-nuts themselves, and how they are stamped, I am putting up some pictures.. I was kind of worried about that after someone gave these a 2 star rating for it.. With that, I was hoping for the best, but expecting something that looked 10 times worse then they actually do. So at least now, you can see the stamping, and decide for yourself, if it bothers you or not.. Me.. No.. they don't.. But that is my opinion. I hope the pictures help you. I posted 3 pictures so you can get a better look at slightly different angles of them.

I really like these on my truck 04 dodge ram 1500, I chose these so I wouldn't have to buy new tires the OEM size fits these. You will need aftermarket lug nuts as the acorn OEM ones are too fat to fit. I bought these: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I6SE5DQ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_68 Despite what amazon's "does it fit" states these do fit perfectly and you end up with 12 extra lug nuts to keep in your toolbox should you need them in the future. They are 3/4" so your stock lug wrench will no longer work, just toss a 3/4" wench in your truck and you're good to go.

Noticed drips from my radiator upper transmission cooler line for my 2000 Silverado, in 2 months it cost me 1 quart of transmission fluid and a stained driveway. Purchased this connector after checking with the Dorman website, used a pick to remove clip and 3/4 inch socket to remove old connector.Snugged everything, added transmission fluid and too it for a test drive and no leaks. Simple fix for a fairly big problem, leaking transmission fluid can cause fires (don't ask me how I know) so if you notice this I would replace this immediately, not a hard job.

Very happy with the light bar, it produces a ton of light and is very easy to install. the only reason I'm giving this a 4/5 is a minor issue with condensation which dried fairly fast and the threads stripped out which was a very easy fix but definitely a great light bar especially for a price under $100

Folks, something isn't right with these. I ran them for 3 months and grease is slinging out of the unit bearing from the passenger side of the vehicle. I'm not sure if that is normal, but the OEM bearings for my 1998 TJ ran 115,000 miles and I don't see that on them. I swapped back in the OEM and will research for a better unit. Not sure if moog is any better either. I'm rather disappointed. I don't mind spending a bit more for high quality. You may get lucky (ie my driver side still appears to be fine I swapped these in on both sides at the same time for PM purposes) but who knows how long that will even last. I hate doubting components critical as these are.

Though this bracket is made for a Jeep, I ended up using it on my boat trailer.  After losing a license plate when pulling my boat out on a slip, the spring action seemed like a good idea.  It took a little rigging to attach it to the trailer, but it looks like it works perfectly.  The bracket is made of thick, rugged metal and the spring action keeps it from getting caught in place.  As a warning to the buyer however, no screws or hardware are included.

These lights are extremely bright, they throw nice crisp light for about 50 ft.  They match my Philips LED license plate light very well. The "bulbs" themselves are nice and heavy and feel well made. They fit in my 2012 Malibu a little snug but otherwise perfect. This is my second purchase from JDM ASTAR, the first being my taillights, which are behind a dark smoke lens tint in these picture. Will be doing the rest of the lights with JDM ASTAR products.

First time using a walker stainless muffler. I have been disappointed in the past with there standard mufflers. They have lasted no more then 2-3 years. We will see how long the stainless muffler last. It does not appear to be completely stainless.Follow up:  Well 4 years later and muffler is rusting out. Obvious that it is not all stainless steel. walker aluminized tail pipe rusted out. Amazing that OEM manufactures can make an exhaust that's lasts but aftermarket manufactures cannot.

There is a huge gap at the top of these. I don't know how the light bar fits yet, because it hasn't arrived yet.(UPDATE) I bent the brackets and now they look way better. There is a bend in them now, but it's better than a huge gap.

The mirrors themselves seem pretty solid and are holding up, I've dropped them accidentally when installing them and they haven't cracked or fallen apart. The mounting bracket however is made of very cheap aluminum, and when ratcheting one side on, the threads stripped out. I proceeded to hand tighten the other side and the mirror was still too loose to be able to ride around with. When tightening the second one to a point where the mirror wouldn't move (or bounce around when riding), it also stripped the threads. Pretty lame.I drilled out the holes then went to a local hardware store to purchase steel bolts and a locknut. I would highly recommend that anyone buying this kit to do this. With how weak the aluminum is, you won't get it tight enough to where your mirrors won't bounce around with every bump you hit on the road. It's an inexpensive mirror kit, so it doesn't hurt to grab some bolts for a few extra dollars.

If you are experiencing lug nuts swelling on your Ford F-150 then you need to buy these before its too late and you cant get them off when you are on the side of the road.My 2012 F150 started to have this problem and the shop had to beat on sockets to get them off. I purchased these and replaced them myself in the driveway. Word of wisdom remove the factory lugs cold and use a breaker bar and a 21mm socket if they are swollen you should use a 22mm socket. It will feel loose but it will get the job done. My factory lug nut wrench would not fit my factory lug nuts thats how bad these junk lugs swell. I checked if the new lugs fit in the factory take off wrench thats in your jack and they do so no need to carry a different size socket unless you really want to.They are I tiny but longer but look gray and well made. Thanks for the good product. I hope this review help someone in need.

Perfect!  I expected to have a tougher time installing this as I even got my plastic wedge tools handy.  I thought it would be too good to be true on what all the reviews are raving about.  I saw the OEM and I couldn't swallow the cost so I wanted to try this out.Just like most of the reviews, the gas pedal just slides over with very little effort, and actually stays on!The brake pedal, you have to remove the current one on the car, then slip this one on.  If you just insert the tops and sides, then wedge your fingers to "fold" the lower flap, it will pop right in.  Literally took me well less than 5 minutes to install both.  Now if I can only find one for the dead pedal for a full look.  The one I saw on Amazon didn't fit (even though it is just a stick-on).  Still looks good without it though!Cost-friendly way to pimp up your ride that is very subtle but makes you feel good.

Took about 40 minutes for me to put on (I started cleaning the Jeep a bit when I did this so that delayed me slightly). All I can say, OEM should use these! I didn't realize how cheap and inadequate the OEM part(s) are. I have a 2012 MW3 Edition 2 door Wrangler, these fit perfectly. I also have a bug shield on the hood that amplified the flopping (Driving through the South at night, bugs are crazy thick sometimes) and these new hood mounts fixed that. Putting the bottom piece off/on I used 1/4 ratchet, no issue. Wranglers should come with these from the factory, 5 stars!

Bought a PC680 for my BMW K1200GT motorcycle in 2006. 10 years later its still working great, but I replaced it due to age. Now the old battery is in my lawn mower and still going strong. Just be sure to buy the little Battery Tender Plus 021-0128 and place the bike on the charger whenever its stored in the garage. That's how mine lasted 10 years!

Worked great for my 1999 E430 4Matic.Seems like some of the bad reviews happened when the part was ordered from a third party.I ordered this part directly from Amazon and got it the same day. I received a genuine Bosch box with a halographic sticker sealing it. The part came nicely wrapped in wax paper and had protective caps on both ends.I had a P0170 fault code stored. I replaced the sensor and cleared the fault. I wanted to put some miles on the car before writing a review. It's been 3 weeks so far and I drove about 850 miles. I checked the vehicle for possible faults today and found no active or stored faults. Problem fixed!

This is a really great detail spray for the cost, detail spray is your final wipe down and this evaporates clear, no need to use a second towel to wipe away any residue. I use an edgeless towel as a final buff and this really gives a deep gloss. The smell has a sweet spice smell, very pleasant not fruity. I feel it performs with the other top details sprays from Adams, PoorBoy, Meguiar's and Chemical Guys, in which I have all of their flagship detail sprays. Just two spritz on the towel is all that is needed if you go more the product will spread easily and not leave any residue.This detail spray doesn't add to wax beading it is a final wipe for dust or fingerprints and does a super job of smoothing and giving the paint a deep look to the paint on my 18-year-old daily driver truck night or day. I will be getting the gallon size of this and the spray will be behind my seat.

We all know how hot our cars can be in the heat of summer so anything we can do help make them cooler is worth a try.  There are some days when my leather steering wheel is literally too hot to touch on top where the sun has shone down on it all day.  This set includes the pop up front window shade as well as two smaller (14"x18") shades for the back windows.The front shade literally popped out of the included storage case as I started to remove it.  It fit easily into my window and covered the entire length of my Dodge Durango's windshield.  I propped it up behind my review mirror and it stayed in place perfectly.  The smaller shades unfold just as easily.  Included are two suction cups that when you push down, it opens up to clip on the smaller shades.  You can them put them wherever you like.The only issue I have is trying to fold the large shade back up into the storage bag.  After 5 minutes, I finally gave up and just threw it in the back of my car.  I'm hoping with a little practice, I will figure the trick out.  I should have paid more attention to how it came out of the bag I guess.  * I purchased this item at a discounted price to test for quality and provide a truthful and unbiased review.

Arrives from China. At time of review, the seller is now "Unknown".The Emblem does not look like OEM at all and does NOT look as pictured. Amateur quality. It's too small, scratched, and there's a black mark on the "R". The supplied metal plates are Too large for the backing which would stick out from the emblem. Threading holes are too small and not secure to hold badge in place.

This kit was priced in my budget. I am very pleased with it. Keep in mind that you do have to be a thinker & a tinkerer. I looked @ a lot of videos for help when I was in doubt. Nuts & bolts vibrate loose(use loctite & double nut where possible) maybe some JB weld if you like. I suggest adding caliper or disc brakes. I added caliper brakes because they are inexpensive & there is not a lot of space for disc brakes on the rear for my bike. I did have to take the exhaust to the muffler shop to heat it up & bend it so that the left pedal would clear it. I coated the inside of the gas tank with POR-15 tank sealer to avoid leaks. I have make my own tank @ the time of this review.(see photos). These are fun kits to have on a bike. Adjust the carb by, turning in the idle adjuster screw all the way in,then 2 and 3/4 turns counter clock wise.

Needed a place to put my jack......saw this and thought that would be a good place for it.  Out of the way.  Was able to install in about 15 minutes and got the jack on after that.  Easy.  Have a 98 TJ and they had the correct bolts for it.  I do not have any problems with my window washer sprayer hitting my windows.  Hood will not lay completely back on the window like it used to........but If I need it to go back that far, I can always take the jack off. I do suggest getting a jack handle isolator......helps with the rattle.  My TJ vibrates a lot as I have oversized tires on her, so the wingnuts vibrate loose on occasion.  Just a couple of turns and they are back tight again.

These are the same OEM hooks that would come from the factory. Very heavy-duty - I was surprised at how big they actually are from the hook back to the mounting arms. They bolt right-up to the frame and include the necessary bolts. I installed them in about an hour and that included neatly cutting the openings in the blank plastic shroud. (Take your time with this...The outline of where to cut are clearly defined by raised sections of the plastic shroud. But I know of an instance where the person used the wrong tool and it looks like it was cut with a dull chainsaw (horrible). I used a Dremel with a cutoff wheel and quickly (QUICKLY) ran a flame from a propane torch over the cuts when done to just smooth them over (this is optional - you would barely see the cuts after the hooks are installed anyway). It came out perfect. These add a nice touch to the truck as well as functionality if needed in snow, sand, etc. * Make sure you install them as per the factory (each hook opening facing "out"). The hooks have a left side and a right side and if you swap them, they will allow you to mount them incorrectly facing in. While it may not make a huge difference in appearance, the hooks facing out ensure tow straps won't slip off when being used.

Required if you are running Stage 2 or 3 splitters on your C7 Corvette.  It mates well with the RR-XT-2 67 ramps and is made from the same material.  Did not notice any slipping or deformation of the ramp parts when being used and it is very light.  Big, but light.  Would have posted 5 stars if their website told me that I need these to work for my car before buying the Race Ramps (which they did say it works with the Corvettes, but didn't say not ones with the Stage 2 or 3 splitter).  Great product tho.

My review is based on ease of install and appearance since I haven't driven with them installed yet. I only installed mine using the screw holes provided with the factory rock guards, so I still need to drill the holes for the other screws. Everything lined up nicely and they look pretty good. It comes with clear vinyl to protect the paint surface which is nice, since I heard some complain of scratched paint. I think they look pretty good and so far Im happy with them for the price. Got mine from Amazon Warehouse Deals so it was a bargain!

Recently I was filling some tires and using that El Cheap-o tool and someone handed me an digital tire pressure gauge. It was like someone handed me an iPhone after I was using a Palm (do you remember those?). It kind of does the same thing but it is a leap forward in technology.There is a bunch of settings on this digital tire pressure gauge that I have no clue what they mean, but most important to me is Psi. That tells me exactly how much air my tires have in them and that is very important if you care about not dying on the road. I also really like the back light around the numbers and the light around the spot where you place the tire valve. That will come in handy in the dark or when I am trying to put this thing on rims that have the valve recessed and in the shadow.The tire pressure gauge seems to be rather accurate as tested against the machine at Wawa. I know that is anecdotal but that is the best I can do. It also fits in my hand perfectly and is super easy to get on the valve stem.Disclosure: I received this product for free/discounted however this in no way influenced my review.

Shipped fast. Works great on my 2016 F 150 Lariat. Nicely tucks away under the bumper, clean and easy to work. Makes life easier getting in and out of the bed of the truck. Recommended if you don't have the step in the tailgate.

Ok here's my review after I got the right set, WOW!!!! Look abs sound freaking amazing!! Best sound ever for slip ons. Nice abs deep rumble. 20 min install in garage on kick stand with two sockets. Awesome buy!!

I purchased this system 14 months ago because of the reviews figuring that someday I would end up in a position where I was not going to be able to do a gravity dump. Today was the day. The sewage connection was higher than the camper's valve and it was too far anyway.I went to Lowes and bought 1" pvc pipes and fittings and got the job done in a jiffy. I really like the system and will not go back to gravity dumps again.The one thing I didn4like was that the hose is not secured with hose clamps and the fittings come off effortlessly so I purchased some and installed them.I would recommend this product to anyone.

I just installed these in my license plate light housings on my Scion FRS. Huge difference from stock bulbs in color. Intensity seems higher too but I haven't seen them at night yet. As long as these don't burn out anytime soon, my 5 star rating remains. I'll update if they go bad or dim. Otherwise, excellent and brighter than some 5050 SMD options out there and miles above stock.Edit: I just checked these lights during full-on nighttime (see 2nd pic attached), and oh my, THESE ARE BRIGHT!! Very nice and adds a level of cool factor indeed. Just don't drive like a dummy because your plate will be highly illuminated with these!

Had it out of the box and on the vehicle (2015 Rubicon) in 30 minutes, it only took that long because my beautiful wife of 21 years wouldn't listen to my pleas of "just thread a few and I'll dress it up because this is kind of heavy!" I shot just a bit of black spray paint on the silver hardware that's exposed from not having the bends that obscure them on the stock bumper but that was just my preference.If you want a truly bolt on part that's worth every penny (which I shopped around online for a few evenings), then this is the bumper for you; the last Jeep I owned was a 91 back in 2003 and this was amazingly simple for a novice like me (with the assistance of my awesome Vance and Hines breaker bar).

This stuff is amazing, I'm using it on my multi color gel coat and it is coming out almost like new. I did have to sand a few spots with 600 grit then over again with 1500 grit and it polished out like glass. I am polishing it with a digital speed 7" Chicago electric polisher from harbor freight. People can't believe the boat is over 20years old! I'm not even done yet, I'm gonna take it down with the 2000grit and polish again, should glow!

This was more flimsy than I expected. Most of the structural support is reliant on the license plate itself and this is more of a secondary support. I secured the plate to my grill with toggle bolts and the slots in the product made this step very easy. The built in nuts advertised are 2mm too narrow from each other and barely fit my license plate (pictures attached).The hardware supplied works fine, but half of the pieces had terrible plating (seen in attached images). The length of the bolts supplied is enough for the plate and a washer - anything more like a license plate cover will require you to get some replacements at your local hardware store (a few cents each).

Very happy with these chocks. Heavy-duty rubber that I'm guessing will have a long life with the ability to abuse them (throw in back of truck, etc.). Funny that the majority of pictures on Amazon show them situated in what I feel is the wrong position... the arced, smooth side should go against the tire and the flat, rough side on the ground for better traction. But, you can obviously use them however you want. They do not cover the width of the tire, but are wide and sturdy enough to work even on large truck tires and therefore are lighter weight than a full width chock. The handles are nice, but I drilled out the hole above the handle and threw some rope in for easy grab handles. Works great! Would recommend these chocks (especially vs. plastic). And yes, they come out of the wrapping with a strong rubber stink, but as others have said, they're made for either the garage or outdoors so not sure why the big complaint? I'm assuming the odor will fade with time.

Yes, this is my second one, I purchased one also in May 2014, when I first brought my Ram 1500 Express, Dark Blue. I haven't put it on yet, I'm waiting for the warm weather, so I can put on the 22" R/T chrome rims that I brought. I also have some custom made red seat covers, which really makes the truck look nice.

When I received this item the box was in great condition and seemed unopened. But when I slit the seal and opened the box.. both look used and had scratches. Unsure if these were slightly used like when Brazzers sell their "slightly used couches" or plugged in to see if they're compatible with their vehicle.Pictures don't do justice but CLEARLY you can see how much brighter it is than OEM halogen lights. These are super white (6k) and shine more than OEM halogens. I am super satisfied other than the product being slightly used in a "brand new" box. Worth the money! Now on to find out the longetivity.. manufacturer claims 50k hours of life. I do maybe 1 hour if night driving, 240 hours per year... So these will last me "208 years" lol.Will recommend to anyone.. especially at this price range! Amazon rules

Worked exactly as I needed in my transfer cases and rear differential.I was having a grinding noise at 200k, the oil was changed at 100k, but I changed the oil and still had noise. I added 1 oz to the transfer case and also added 1 oz to the rear differential and my grinding noise went away completely. I was so amazed with how well this worked. It now feels smooth as butter even at 200k!I personally depend very heavily on reviews that are posted on Amazon, as do many other consumers. I not only read what reviewers say, but look to see what their pictures reveal about a products true quality and description. I aim to not only feature the products I review in many different aspects, analyzing many qualities, I also provide my own opinions on ALL the good AND bad experiences I have with the product I review. I take time to learn and use a product as it was intended before I review it, and I have used this specific product thoroughly.My rating system:5 -  Met all my expectations. Was described and pictured perfectly. Exactly what I wanted and needed. Extremely useful product and a great value. Would recommend to family and friends.4 - Very good product. Exactly as described. May have a minor flaw, mentioned in the review, that does not detract from the products perceived value. Would recommend to family and friends.3 - Average product. Not exactly as described, or misleading advertising or product pictures. Possibly substandard build quality, or something else explained in the review. Would mention as an option to family and friends, but not recommend.2 - Wouldn't recommend this product. Poor build quality, not close to being as described. Flimsy and fragile. Difficult to use due to product flaws.1 - Do not purchase whatsoever. Usually only given if product lasts only a few hours/days/etc. I do not leave 1 star reviews without contacting the seller. I will be returning the product.I did NOT receive ANY discounts for this product. I am reviewing it because I do review most of the products that I purchase.

I purchased two sets of KayakStackers in order to haul two 8 foot and two 10 foot kayaks on my Yakima round bar roof rack. The directions provided with the KayakStacker indicate that four kayaks can be hauled with one set; however, since my kayaks are short, I wanted to be able to haul the kayaks without the bow and stern straps. To do this I installed KayakStackers such that each kayak would be against a stacker bar and I strapped each kayak to the roof rack and stacker bar with separate straps. This requires two straps per kayak for a total of eight straps required for four (4) kayaks. I also run a strap through all of the kayak handles on the bow and stern of the kayaks so that if one kayak were to come loose, the other kayaks would keep it from coming off the roof rack. Please note that although this arrangement works well for me, I recommend that stern and bow straps be used in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. I have included a few pictures with the review which may be helpful.

I have a few inflators and have used many in my lifetime. The fit and finish on this unit is awesome! You can feel the difference just by picking up this inflator. The deflator button is at the 4 o'clock position and the trigger is smooth and solid. The dial is clear and legible. The hose is stainless braided and the 90 degree chuck is really heavy duty. This is by far the best inflator I have ever owned and used. Worth every penny

This helmet is near perfect. Fits on my head right. Sizing was correct (M). Looks great, and no mushroom head. It's louder than not wearing a helmet at all, but I will be wearing earplugs if I'm going outside of town or a long ride. Don't get any other half helmet, this is the one. The easy release is so nice.

(Update 7-17...  Bought a UV meter and UV detecting beads. See my comment below in replies)I bought 10 of these for two trailers I use on a ranch. I wanted to reduce UV exposure to the tires in order to prolong the life of the tires.The covers fit perfectly and have held onto the tires with strong and gusty winds we have here BUT I don't think these covers do any good keeping the UV light from damaging the tires. Sunlight goes right through the covers (I bought white) and I'm a little disappointed.As you can see in my photo, sunlight is going right through the cover in my spare tire, and you can see my hand shadow clearly through the thin cover.(Update 5-17, I bought a UV meter here on Amazon AND UV detecting beads (beads for lack of a better word) and the meter and the beads confirmed my suspicions. These covers ALLOW UV rays to penetrate. I then took a laser thermometer and took a reading of one of my tires NOT having a cover (same trailer, same side) and then took a temp reading of one of my tires that had been covered all morning, but removing the cover and recording the temp in less than a minute and these tire covers do a pretty good job of reducing the heat-load on a tire, but didn't do a good job of convincing me that my tires were "protected" from UV light.

Worked great. Took a lot of pounding to get the seal on, can't imagine doing it without this too. I just grabbed the top of the axle yoke, closest to the seal surface, with a vise - slid on the seal and this tool and hammered it on. It seats the seal in the knuckle too, then the bearing hub pulls the axle and seal into place.

INSTALLED as fog lights. The yellow fogs works very well with the 6500K WHITE LED headlight bulbs that I've installed. The LED headlights are bright, and the yellow fogs gives the the landscape and objects more details and makes everything stands out more when both are on. A very nice compliment... THUMBS UP!!

I recently purchased this Marine Lighter Socket for my Piaggio MP3 Scooter.  I have a Vespa GTS 300, which has the "Lower Quality" Socket in the knee pad, and wanted something much better that would be waterproof. I "Assumed" that this socked would work with all of the standard Cigarette Lighter plugs, and I was quickly proven "Wrong".  You can attempt to use it, but it will have an intermittent connection with some of the plugs available today.  Out of frustration as I was not happy with my installation initially, I ordered the matching Marine Locking Cigarette Light Plug, and OMG... This changed my frustration to Glee...  Yes, you have to have the skill to solder and wire this Plug up, but once you do you will be very happy.  My first Plug I wired up was for a Tour Master Synergy 2.0 Heater Gear, and fused it to 10 AMPS. I went on a 300+ Mile trip, and the LED stayed on, no intermitted connections, and the way its made you can keep the two plugged in while it is raining.  I higly recommened this Socket and the Matching Marine Twist Plug. Good luck on using the standard Cigarette Plugs, they will not work very well.

I don't normally write reviews but this is going to help out a bunch of people. If you do not want to remove the bumper do yourself a favor and superglue the washers on the trailer hitch side before installation. Then use your wrench and put a piece of painters tape on the backside of it to hold the nut in place and tighten the bolt from the backside down. Great product.

Ha, I laugh at how easy this spray-on bed liner worked.  Why pay $425 for a Rhino Lining, DIY and save hundreds.  No over-spray, easy to apply, ensure you get the air gun to apply.  minimal tape job needed, mask off your lines, this product keeps a straight line via the tape line.

Fixed CEL on my 99 Integra. I had to use an adapter that already had a drill out to restrict the airflow so I didn't use the supplied ones. Which if you do you need special pliers. I was also lucky that my straight pipe was adjustable so I didn't have it take off my exhaust to install bc it's a tight fit to try and rotate it on.

These lights are absolutely AMAZING. I'll be honest, I didn't expect much but I was blown away. These will out perform any driving lights sold at Wal Mart I can say without a doubt as i've tried them all. The build quality is SOLID. Plenty of wire to run these and regular and low profile brackets are included. These are a great value. You won't find a better set for the money. The gaskets look like they will keep moisture out without issue. Poly carb lenses aren't the greatest but will be more shatter resistant than glass. You will need the wires/relay and switch to run these unless you replace your factory driving/fog lights and hook them into those harnesses. The LED's look a little foggy in the stock photos but they aren't, they are like little projector bubbles to focus the light and work quite well. I did receive these to review but my review is not a lie. You will love these. Disclaimer: I received these at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

Works really well and seems well build, it is spot on with my "pencil pressure gauge".On mine there is a button in front, the gauge does not power on when I push it on the valve, I need to press the button to power the unit on.Also the display seems different than the old pictures posted here. On the back is written 052017 which sems to indicate it was made week 5 of 2017.

Was impressed with quailty of product and the seller also. Bought two to install GPS in wifes and my cars. Took a piece of plastic and tried to drill hole to fit but hole saw wasn't right size, anyway used pocket knife to trim to 1 inch and filed three small slots at apropiate places. Great fit thouh after looking at interior of vechicle decided to hardwire and ziptie under dash out of way. Cut off and saved the fuses for later as didn't need using fuse tap to fuse box. Hope this helps someone. Have one picture showing test plastic.

The turn signals on my Honda VTX1300R bike are not self-canceling, and it is easy to drive for miles before noticing that the signals are still on. I bought these to give me feedback. I placed them on my mirrors (using a small loop clamp) and they do an excellent job, while being small enough to preserve the look of the bike.

Great mirrors... No more vibration than other tow mirrors. Fairly easy to install. All features worked perfect!Only thing I would ask them to change- wire harness length... a few more inches would make things a bit easier.*One note on install and this has nothing to do with the manufacturers... I used a "Pep-Boys" YouTube video as my guide (I would still recommend the video to guide you but...). It got the job done but made it look far easier than it actually was!

Perfect fitment for my 2005 Subaru Impreza WRX 2.0L.  I saw this listed on NASIOC as THE filter for my EJ20 and decided to try it out.  Honestly, I miss the black Fuji Heavy Industries oil filters direct from Subaru that have since been replaced by lower quality Honeywell units.  But, this filter fits the bill for the right price and availability.

Works probably 85% as well as the factory antenna did However my only complaint it how silly I feel I look going down the highway with it bent over at a good 45 degrees from the wind and it being a little too flexible. All and all works though and looks great when your vehicle isn't moving.

I must say all the PulseTech products work as designed and Customer Service is great at the factory... Fantastic answers and will help with what you need to purchase for your applications...I put it on in Feb of 2012 and as of Nov 2012 my battery operates like new. It took me about 3 weeks to see the difference in my 3-1/2 year Exide battery in my van when traveling at night... The Battery was failing as the lights were dimming on headlights and on interior etc prior to the 3 weeks of installation.  I said to my partner as we were coming home from NC, wow, I can see at night again since my lights were much brighter and "were on low beam". What really tells me how much brighter my lights are is when on coming folks at night blink their lights at mine and my lights are only on low beam...By the way, I have 3 of PulseTechs Solargizers for Harley, trolling motor batteries and barn light battery."

I drive a 2013 Subaru WRX 5 door hatch. This is an absolute must for dog owners. It's nearly a perfect fit, but I believe I'll need to drill holes for the provided snaps if I want a perfect fit. The factory seats in the WRX do not hav these holes. Regardless, the velcro along with the headrest cords seem to be enough to hold them in place for now.

UPDATED 10/6/2016: I've updated the review from 4 stars to 5 stars; if you look at my original review below you'll see the reason I took off one star was due to the price, but now the price had come down to the range that I thought was more reasonable, I see no reason to keep the review at 4 stars on an otherwise excellent product. In fact I just bought a set for my mother as well!This is a set of reusable roadside LED flare kit that I received at a discount for review. The design is elegantly simple: the black plastic base folds up together for easy storage; the flare has a LED top, reflective striped body, and a strong magnet on the bottom that can either tether it to the black plastic base, or to the body of your vehicle!The LED has 3 modes: flashing red, solid red, and white (as flashlight). Powered by 3xAAA batteries, it should last you quite a while. The LED is activated by a simple red button on the side, and the whole package (2 x flares + 2 x bases) fit neatly into a plastic storage case, with room to spare to store 6 x AAA batteries!I took one star off due to its price; although I received this set at a discount for review, if I were simply purchasing it I would have a hard time justifying the price tag of over $40.00; I think it would sell much better if the price was lowered to around $20 or so, but that is just my opinion. Besides the price point, the flare kit is very useful (they stuck to the side of my car well and are sturdy when attached to the plastic base) and although I hope to never have to use them, I am sure they would work well should the situation ever calls for it.

It works great!  It's been solid,  hasn't moved when I've rolled into it.  Definitely has done what I need it to do .. which is to stop my car from hitting my motorcycle.  I use this with a lighted stop sign and both have worked splendid so far.  Definitely recommend.

clips that's why they get four stars.  It is pretty easy to install I clean the top of the grill with alcohol applied the  molding on the top and let it sit in the house for 24 hours before installing it that way it gives a time for the adhesive to make good contact. It shows that I should've received a bunch of clips .  Which was missing from the box. Besides that it was an easy install  Sorry about the pictures I live in Las Vegas Nevada.  Today is 65

Fit was good.  Install was easy.  Color is nice - a slight blue-ish hint, but only obvious since what just came out was a golden yellow.  After just a few minutes, you don't really pick up on any blue (I didn't want it to be "blue" so I was glad about that).  I did notice that there was some flicker when playing around during install, so I hope that they don't flicker in normal use.  Time will tell if they hold up to repeated heat/cold cycles...Note that the polarity DOES matter on these.  An LED is a Light Emitting Diode, and current only flows in one direction in a diode.  So some people might be returning these thinking they don't work and posting reviews as such, when all they need to do is flip it around...  I didn't think to check the package to see if it had instructions for this, since I knew this already, but pretty sure it didn't.  Pretty stupid of Recon.  Recon's instructions are definitely worthless, which I found out from doing projector lights on my 2002 F-350 crew cab.

Bright Light!! REPLACED a 12in bar with this one. the 12 didn't throw enough light long distance. This 20in eyourlife light is super bright, not so much the floods but the spots throw about 100 yds out. Works perfect for my application.

They are far brighter than stock/halogen bulbs and draw much less electricity/amps. Ed is an incredible man. Always there to help or answer any questions. In the need of LED lighting for motorcycles, I will look no farther than Paradise Lights.The value has been unmatched. Support on the phone without pressing 1 or waiting a long time has been a huge benefit. I'll try to attach 2 pictures; before and after install. One turn signal is stock, the other LED. And 1 video.Thank you, Ed.RobertUPDATE!! Today, almost one year later, these bulbs are still running strong with zero issues. I cannot emphasize enough how much better these bulbs and Ed's support have been! My lighting always gets complimented and other bikers, and drivers alike, like the single, quick, clear  LED flash from my turn signals. This REALLY grabs attention from ongoing traffic. You know; like those who are texting while driving :)Thank you, Ed!!I foget to add: I also have ALL LED lighting from Paradise with same results.

Just what I needed. Installation was simple. You can do it yourself but a second set of hands is always helpful. It took me an hour to complete. Socket wrench and screw driver is all you need. Great installation videos on you tube. The distance this allows the trunck to slide back makes a huge difference. My wife's not leaning on my back and it feels like I'm riding alone. Great product !!!

HELPFUL HINT: Instructions mention NOTHING about small tabs [clearly seen in attached photo] extending 90-degrees from 3 prongs in back of headlamp. I surmise tabs help keep wiring harness snugged onto headlamp's prongs. But those tabs sure make it HARD to remove, and install wiring harness. You just have to keep finessing it until it comes off, or goes on. HEADLAMP works great!  P.S. Those "tabs" are pictured in diagram on box, but are never mentioned in the Instructions text as to what they're for, or how HARD they make it to plug in wiring harness. I even watched a YouTUBE video on DIY installation-- the guy just plugged in wiring harness effortlessly!  Not sure how he did that w/ a tab sticking out at ninety-degrees from each prong!  With patience and a lot of elbow grease, headlamp did plug in, snugly.

These lights are incredibly bright. I originally bought these for my license plate light but it was too long, then I decided to try them in my door puddle light. These work perfectly in the door. The way my light is designed the LEDs all face down allowing for better ligjt distribution than the previous LEDs I had in them before. These lights have absolutely no blue or yellow tints to them which is another plus.

Filter fits my 2004 Toyota Highlander so easily.Instructions are included inside the sealed package, or look up Youtube videos on how to do it.(this was my first career cabin air filter change) - it was quite easyTakes a sweaty five minutes tops!Tips - you'll need to peer through the glove box area and be able to see where it is. The first time, you won't know where it is, the 2nd time, you can do this blindfolded. I recommend having a flash light or doing this in a shaded area with a flash light.Do not breathe in the filth upon removal haha =pAttaching pics of my disgusting air filter after 144k miles after it was conceived versus the new filter

Purchasing this i didn't expect the quality I received. I thought it would be of cheap construction and barley visible during daylight hours. However the construction tolerances were impressive. Constructed out of durable aluminum? (not sure) Its been sitting on the rear roof for several months now and functions perfectly. The brightness of the light is quite exceptional even during daylight hours. At night, its just short of blinding you if you stare at it. No mounting modifications were necessary for my application; pretty straight forward install. Probably more flashing options than i would ever need, but its also nice it remembers your last setting, and the directionals are always right there.

Installed on my 2017 Ford F150.  The stock (non-offroad package) suspension was very spongy and lethargic.  It always felt like I was bottoming out on every bump.  Installing these was easy (eventually).  Following the provided directions, the first side took 75 minutes and a lot of swearing.  They suggested you use soap to install these.  DON'T use soap.  I had some silicone spray laying around and tried that, and it went into the spring much easier.  The second side took about 10 minutes using silicone spray instead of soap. (I attached some pics below-not sure why they are attaching to Amazon sideways).  The ride difference to me is great.  The truck feels like it absorbs bumps in the front now as a truck should and no longer bounces for 10 minutes over a small bump (exaggerating).  Definitely worth the money.  I also installed the SumoSprings Solo Custom Helper Springs - Rear Axle SSR-117-47 which made a huge difference in the rear end.

First, please note the following:  The picture shown on the Amazon page is incorrect.  The shape of the filter is not rectangular as shown on the picture but is a long and narrow, but thick filter.  Also, as one reviewer said, this item CANNOT be used on your Jeep unless you have a MOPAR aftermarket housing previously installed in your car.  2010 or earlier Jeep Grand Cherokees did not have any factory installed cabin filters.This filter is a perfect replacement for the MOPAR brand that came with my filter housing. It works and fits exactly as the original.

Goes on in less than a minute and looks great. Yes, it fits the 2005-2015 Tacoma even though this part was released for 16+ models. Just hold the included spacer in place, slide the chrome tip over it, and tighten down the clamp. It's that easy.

Love this tire for the terrain I ride in the north east. It loves just about anything you can throw at it. It was a bit slippery until broken in so be careful on the road for the first 100 miles or so but after that, you're good to go. I have 600 miles on this now with about 200 of those on the road and it shows almost no wear at all other thelan the leading edge of the knobs being slightly rounded. This is mounted on a CRF250L

After using 5000K HIDs -- which have performed extremely well -- for the past couple of months, I wanted to try out the Kensun All-in-One LED as well as the Opt7 H11 Fluxbeam bulbs that have received raving reviews.So why would I consider swapping to LED you might ask?Simply because of some of the benefits the LED has over HIDs which include: longer lifespan, higher durability, cooler running temperature, lower lumen depreciation, easier to install (since they usually don't need a ballast) & finally my favorite --> instant on w/ no warm up period.But after doing a side by side comparison of the Kensun All-in-One and the Opt7 Fluxbeam against my current 5000K HIDs, it is more than clear to me now that the aftermarket LED headlight market can't keep up w/ the HIDs when used in OEM halogen projector housing. Upon installing the Opt7 & the Kensun LED headlight kits in my 2015 Camry's projector housing, I immediately noticed -- as several other reviewers speak off -- that it projects about 70% of its beam right in front of my Camry for about 6-8 ft but then fades away at eye level. Against the wall, the beam pattern was close to my current HID setup -- although my 5000K HID definitely had a stronger cutoff projection -- but on the road was a completely different story.I have attached a few photos comparing the two. Out of the three, the Kensun had the WEAKEST light output with the Opt7 coming second and my current XenonDepot 5000K HIDs being the brightest.If you MUST go with an LED headlight kit -- knowing these issues I have listed -- then go for the Opt7.Needless to say, all these raving positive reviews goes to show that public opinion isn't always right. I hope my images help you decide which route to take.

Pros: Inexpensive, Fantastic area coverage, well made.Cons: No instructions in the box (I'll explain).I've read a lot of the reviews on these mirrors. It appears that the biggest complaint is that they are flimsy. Here's my take: When I opened the package, the mirrors were indeed "light". Still, the mirror backs are metal, the rubber mounting around the glass is great, and the glass is convex, large, and provides excellent field of view behind the motorcycle. If that's not what you are looking for then this clearly isn't the mirror for you. Though not "fancy", these mirrors mimic OEM and provide a much larger and safer viewing area.Here's the most important part (regarding the "no instructions"): Who needs instructions, right? I mean, really, you just screw them in and your good, right? WRONG! These mirrors, like so many other parts on your bike, should be mounted using a "thread locker". My personal preference is Loktite 242 (blue). Here's why. Some of the reviews I read indicated "stripped threads". With a "thread locker", you don't need to tighten the mounts beyond their designed torque specifications. And here's where I think they could do their product better: If I were the manufacturer, I'd include instructions that read like this:1) Remove the mounting stem from the mirror.2) Apply thread locker to both sets of threads (top and bottom)3) Thread the mirror into the mount (usually the clutch and brake reservoir)4) When the threads have reached bottom, back them out just enough to position the mirror stem the way you want it.5) Tighten the stem nut snugly using a wrench. Do not over tighten.6) Mount the mirror to the stem (using thread locker).7) Once the mirror has been threaded on the stem as far as it can go, back it off just enough to position as desired.8) Position the mirror so that there is maximum adjustability up, down, right and left, for best driving visibility. (Re-adjust bottom of stem if necessary).9) Tighten the locking nut on the stem snugly so that the mirror can be adjusted without the stem moving.10) Allow the thread locker to solidify (overnight).Voila! Mirrors are mounted and secure!The bottom line: I think for the price, these are the best and widest area mirrors you can buy for your bike. They look nice, and the functionality is second to none.

Easy installation.  Excellent match to factory brushed silver accents.  Rear adhesive strip didn't hold perhaps because Amazon sold this as a returned item and the covers to the adhesive strips were removed.  Nevertheless, it installed securely.I received this item at a substantial discount (45%) because another purchaser returned it.  The regular asking price is rather high regardless of its excellent fit and finish.UPDATE 10 hrs later........The cover came completely undone, as the adhesive strips wouldn't hold.  I put another set of double sided tape on top of the originals and reinstalled the cover.  Seems fine and while the original tapes still felt sticky yet didn't hold, I can't say for sure this is a fault since it was used.  Others have commented on the tape. however..  Downgraded to 4 Stars and a follow up will be done on the new install with the extra layer of tape.UPDATE 5-15-16  No amount of tape was going to hold this down.  Whether this one is just a fluke (it was returned once already) or is representative of them all, I can't say.  Had I paid full price, it would definitely would have been returned.  As it is, a #8 1/2"  stainless screw drilled through the center of the item and into the factory console did the trick.  Kludgey but effective.  DOWNGRADED TO A GENEROUS 3 STARS.

These bulbs are much bigger than expected! Which is great, as they have tons of LEDs in them. I installed these in my 2011 Mazda 3 Sedan and they're very, very bright. Easy to install and they make sure you can see what's behind you. Highly recommended.

Used this to bypass the heater core on a LS1 swap I did. Definitely better than using a big loop of hose. I did end up trimming one side a little so they lined up, but given this isn't the factory purpose for this hose that's obviously no big deal. Should work for any LS application including the 4.8/5.3/6.0 truck engines.

This exactly fits my 2015 Ram 1500 Crew Cab Diesel pickup without any modification. The power fold feature of the truck probably should not be used, but this is not a problem as I never fold them anyway. The wide tab just touches the door when folded and could probably scratch the paint.Other people have reported that they needed to be trimmed to fit, however in my case this was not needed. Excellent product and works well. Thanks, JS

Gave me the look I wanted, protection to the radiator, and simple to install. Also is very easy to remove if you need to scrub bugs off.

I am a big fan of LED lighting. My entire house is almost lit with LED bulbs. I also converted all the exterior lights of my old car to LED. I missed the brightness of my old reverse lights so I upgraded the ones on my new car to LED.These are great bulbs. The page claims 1000 lumens per bulb and I believe it. Auto parts store bulb replacements are 264 lumens. I can see so much better at night with these. I'm not as nervous backing up using my non night vision camera since the upgrade. I see these as a safety upgrade. You can see better at night and people can also see you better. I don't have a good camera for night shots but you can see the color difference here. The new bulbs are white and I can see probably twice as far using them.

This looks like a great set with many different locking lug patterns. I do roadside assistance and occasionally have customers with locking lugs. I HAD to have this set. 9 times out of 10, customers do not know where their lug key is at so I would have to tell them of the usual locations that they are stored (glove box, middle console, with the spare tire accessories). If they can't find it, I have to look for it myself. Sometimes they don't have it.This eliminates all of that wasted time and extra work. Now once I notice a locking lug I can take out my set and simply remove it. No, I don't expect it to remove one hundred percent of the ones I run into, but I'm hoping for at least ninety percent.It came very well packaged. The case is nice and compact (12"x2.25"x9.5"). The lug keys feel very durable. Upon initially opening the case, I could smell the polish and noticed some oil spots and some oil still on a couple of the keys. Two of the lug keys looked used.I'm happy to have this set. I believe in being prepared and having the sufficient equipment/tools in whatever I do, and this allows me to do just that.

Started out as a nice cover. After 9 months the cover has deteriorated to the point of tearing apart on the top front. Very disappointed.Update. Just got a message from the seller that there is no warranty on this item. They say it should last one season. Just be aware that this junk doesnt last. Amazon should be ashamed that they would allow this to happen.

I'll admit, I was a bit skeptical at first, but I gave it a shot after watching a few videos of this product's performance on the Internet.  I already had a couple gallons of POR-15 bedliner from a previous purchase and had planned on the painstaking task of rolling it on, but this sprayer became the obvious, easier solution.  I consulted the Wagner Support employees who were EXTREMELY helpful and even went as far as purchasing POR-15, testing it, then emailing a set of pictures back to me with the results of the spray.  I purchased this kit, prepped my vehicle, read the manual, loaded it with POR-15 and let it rip.  After a light coat, then a heavier coat, the sprayer seriously surprised me with its even coverage, its no-hassle operation and easy cleanup.  The sprayer is remarkably accurate, durable and is easy to use.  The hose is lightweight, is pretty forgiving if you accidentally step on it and the turbine unit is no louder than your typical household vacuum cleaner or small garage vac.  Way to go, Wagner!Note:  Be sure to remove and cleanup any rusty patches before spraying. I used an orbital sander with 80-grit paper to remove the worst spots, leveled with body-filler if needed, then painted over with Rust-Oleum Self-Etching Primer. I used Rust-Oleum Rust Reformer on the non-dented spots where rust existed before sanding, allowed to dry, then sprayed a layer of primer on top.  A simple wipe-down with a tack-cloth, masking of all the windows, wheels, exhaust tips with plastic and paper sheets held in-place with Frog-Tape made spraying easy.  My vehicle is from 1997 and I had the benefit of having extra parts in storage - so masking my bumpers, lights, mirrors and emblems wasn't necessary.

People who are not familiar with AC Delco products may be in the same boat as me. AC Delco has great products as a whole. I, out of negligence did not change my fuel filter for 55,000 miles. This filter was on the whole time. I never noticed a change in vehicle performace or an issue at start up. When I took this off a ton of dirt fell out. This unit is made in the USA with great quality. I will continue to buy this filter.

For the price vs. quality, this tailgate light bar is exceptional! It offers the basics and gives very good visibility. Have yet to have a negative thing to say. Dependent on individual vehicle specs, you may need to purchase an extension or adapter depending on model and year. Neither are very expensive. This bar uses a 4 pin flat connector.

I use these in my golf cart. (we live in a golf cart community). Previously I had halogen bulbs in it. Problem was that anytime the batteries were under great demand, (climbing a steep hill) they had a tendency to want to dim down a bit. But since I installed these LED's my problem has been solved! They draw so very little power that they are not affected by draw!! They are crystal white lights and much brighter than the halogens, not to mention the LED's last much longer than other types! Super easy to install, just plug & play! I am planning to purchase some for my cars driving lamps also!! I have enclosed a pic. -Jim

Let me start by saying that I didn't even know Energizer made jumper cables. They came on time just as expected and the boxing is very nice, and I wasn't too worried since I recognized the name brand of Energizer. They have a real nice design and look to them. They are thick with the 6 Gauge wire, which is always needed when it comes to jumper cables. They really do look like some sturdy well made cables, except for one thing. And that one thing is the actual claps you squeeze to put them on and off of your battery terminals. They are made of plastic, it's a thick plastic, but plastic non the less. They do seem very well made, but there is some hesitation once I realized the clamp were made out of plastic. I suppose I will just have to wait and see over time if that plastic can hold up. Realistically I don't see anything else wrong with these cable so I still gives these things 5 out of 5 stars, because it is a very well trusted brand, good design, heavy gauge cable, and regardless of the plastic, they are still definitely a win in my book. And you can beat the price. I got these for girlfriend in case anything happens with her car and I believe they will definitely meet her car jumping needs. They are well worth it.Disclosure: I have received the product at a free or discounted rate for my unbiased opinion of this item. This review is 100% my own honest opinion of this product.

I do Roadside service and my old jump-N-Carry w/ less features was stolen from my car at the Subaru dealer while having air bags replaced. Upgraded to this and I really wasn't disappointed. It reads the cars battery voltage, will warn you if you hook it up backward alerts you with a tone and the LED readout displays the battery you're jumpstarting's voltage or it's own battery voltage as well as the charging voltage from the vehicle running. The long cables are a real blessing and you don't need to charge it after every use as the instructions indicate. I will get 20 to 30 quck jumpstarts sometimes before I'll think to hook it up to my on board AC converter to recharge and it's still cranking them over like a fresh battery.Always remember to have the switch in the off position when not in use and when attaching to any battery. If it has sat for a lengthy I am sure it would need to be recharged as well. I wouldn't recommend this to someone to just have around to use once or twice a year but I would recommend this for someone who's going to use this on a regular basis. This is one great addition do a daily use tool.Update after 7 months of heavy continuous use I had to replace the lugs where the cable connects two the clamps. The cable broke off clean at the connections at the clamps both positive and negative clamps. Wasn't too difficult of a repair for someone with a little bit of soldering know how but it did break in the field and was a little bit of a pain to deal with but no downtime. Again I still rated a 5 stars since I use this on an average 10 times a day 5 days a week and rewinding it 50 times a week x 26 weeks, well you do the math. That's probably a lifetime of use for most folks. That said I found its weak point if that's it that's not bad.

1. This sucker is the heaviest battery I have ever had to lift way up into my Jeep. Ever. It is 49.5 pounds. It contains something like eleven pounds of lead more than the Optima redtop I used to have. Unlike the spiral wind of the classic Optima "six pack" setup, this uses the full battery case dimensions to pack in extra AGM goodness.2. I nearly bought the 34/78 version for my Jeep so I would have more options for things like extra lights, a winch and air compressor lines. The *only* complaint I read regarding the top/side terminal 34/78 version of this battery was that the side terminals sometimes lose contact with the battery, like the internal connection breaks when something is connected to the side terminals. I do not know whether this is true or not, but it was reported often enough that I decided to opt for this one (group 34 with top terminals, positive on the left as you look at the battery).3. The CCA of this battery are high and my first time turning the key the engine JUMPED to life. It caught faster than it has *ever* caught at startup. Impressive! And it was well below freezing outside when this happened, and it was on a Jeep that had been parked, un-started, for nearly two years. I was pretty happy, to say the least.4. This apparently is a cousin of the old Sears Diehard Platinum, a very highly regarded AGM battery for off-road vehicles that run extras such as those listed above. Sears stopped using Odyssey to produce this battery for them. I don't know why, or whether Sears ever found a replacement for the Platinum or what. However, the Odyssey is still produced. It is more expensive than the Sears, but since you currently cannot get the Sears-branded Odyssey battery that is a moot point.5. I do not know whether this battery will one day be produced for Sears again, but this was my best choice right now. Optima batteries have become so hit-or-miss since they moved production to Mexico and started using recycled lead. My last Optima only lasted me 18 months. I decided to not get another one and to try this Odyssey that everyone in the Jeep world has been raving about.6. I am seriously pleased with this battery's starting ability, plus it is a deep discharge-capable unit that can be recharged with ease when it is run very low.EDIT:7. It fits in the Jeep Wrangler TJ (1997-2006) battery tray and lockdown bar perfectly, like it was designed for that space. My Optima Red Top never really fit all that well. I had to clap it down very tightly to keep it from sliding around. This one locks right in and clamps down securely with a lot less torque on the nuts.8. It runs my Warn M8000 winch like a pro without running down. I can winch myself several times on a trail run with the engine off and it will start right up without a second thought.9. It runs my Viair 400C compressor all day, too, if needed. I want a more powerful compressor that is faster, but this is what I have. It uses a lot of power if you have to use air tools out on the trail. And to air up after the day is done it runs a lot taking my four 33" tires from 10 PSI up to 28 PSI. This battery does not even seem to notice the draw. (Yes, my first few times doing this I was stupid enough to air up with the engine off, which was a completely unnecessary drain on my battery. This Odyssey is a champ.You do NOT need to run a two-battery setup in the Jeep so you can run a winch or an on-board air compressor system. A friend used his to run a very small Miller welder that was set up for use in his jeep. I have no idea how he did this, but he said he ditched his second battery after switching to this Odyssey. He uses that space under the hood for something else now. (Probably a stealth beer cooler. Kidding, kidding...) It was actually this seeing him weld a broken track bar bracket on his rear Dana 44 using this battery for the welder and THEN turning the Jeep on that finally convinced me to buy this battery. (He had it off because he did not want to weld back there with the engine running. I think it might have gone BOOM on him had it been running.)I added some pics to show how snugly this fits in the battery compartment of a TJ with the 4.0L engine. Very slick!Highly recommended, despite the high price. This is an excellent product.

I keep a lot of fresh food in my refrigerator.  It sometimes starts to smell, especially if I have onions in there. As soon as this arrived I stuck it in there, and to my surprise, it worked! I even have an onion that's been cut in my fridge and you can't tell. Everything smells fresh and clean. It's made of charcoal, so everything gets filtered out. The size is perfect, it's small and doesn't get in the way. I'm thinking about ordering one for my car as well.I was provided a free sample for test and review purposes.

I have purchased both Mann HU821X and the Mahle OX380D filters for my GL320 and my E320. The Mahle is available for about 30% less; is made in Austria, and has the felt ring at the top and bottom. The Mann is 30% more; made in Mexico; and is lacking the felt ring top and bottom. The felt ring makes a very tight fit - so tight my mechanic thought it was wrong, but it expands as you push it down. I couldn't remember which was better when I ordered this one thinking it was better because it cost more. I was wrong. See the side by side comparison in the photo and decide for yourself.

Got these yesterday, and it was perfect timing! There is a rainstorm today and I was able to put these in yesterday. Took me 5 minutes. They just snap right into where my stock 2016 Rubicon mats were. A perfect fit! Looks better than I thought too. Much better than the more pricey after-market brand ones.

Awesome!! I've had issues with my 2010 6.7 Cummins O2 sensors. I was sick of buying them from the dealer. This took me 2 mins to replace. Let the truck warm up a little bit, then get under it and be careful because it's hot, break the threads and then disconnect the wiring harness. If you need it to cool off longer then go ahead but breaking the threads loose when the trucks hot will make it easier for some. If you have lots of rust I recommend a O2 sensor socket, I broke mine loose with a 7/8 inch O2 sensor socket but could have done it with a large adjustable. This O2 sensor also came with Anit-seize. Once you take out the old sensor, put anti-seize on the new sensor threads, be generous. Thighten it down, you don't have to torque it very hard, especially on a hot exhaust just good and tight. Plug the sensor in and reset your check engine light. It will take about 100 miles of driving to fully reset your computer so it can be ready for a smog test. Good Luck!

I off road a lot and the last thing I want is to be stuck. I originally bought this because of price but it has been tested and never let me down. I destroyed the metal cable, destroyed the wireless adaptor by burning it out and water, the unit was fully submerged. I blew my engine by hydrolocking it, the unit was completely under water in the middle of a small pound but it pulled me out and got me to shore so my jeep was not stranded. It's never let me down and still works great. I just bought and installed a new wireless transmitter and it's good as new. Did the same by going to synthetic 20,000 pound cable. This thing is more than perfect and has never left me stranded.

Pretty disappointed, has great features, but don't work correctly. Remotes hardly work, even from a foot away. Alarm keeps going off randomly even though I've set it to "Warn Away" mode and nothing is even happening to the bike because it's in my driveway. And yes, I've also set the sensitivity to the lowest possible setting and even a small breeze will set it of...I've stopped using the alarm all together now.The positive is that it has great potential and maybe I'll consider re-arming the alarm sometime. It's very useful for annoying the neighbors by going off all the time for no reason.Only reason I won't return this product is because I drilled a hole in my bike for the LED theft light, which actually looks legit. But if I return it then I'll just have an empty hole in my bike, even if it is a tiny hole.Overall I'm disappointed in how this alarm has worked so far especially for the price. Nowadays you can get basically what I got (a defective alarm) for like $20-$30 (here on Amazon) , I was hoping to get a little more oomph than the cheaper alarms though.Edit: took away another star. No matter how I mount the alarm it is always going off for no reason. It is incredibly annoying checking on my bike all the time.

2002 Tahoe.  While the LED replacements for the 168s I used in the map lights, and the license plate lights, etc.,  will fit in the same socket, I noted on the original front side turn signals, the bulbs were p194 and had a silver glaze.  I'm not a car guy, but I figured if the factory used a different bulb in the same socket, there was a reason for it.  So I bought these 194 specific bulbs.  They are much brighter, probably because of 5 large emitters versus 3 small ones on the others.Further research is very confusing as Sylvania lists the 168 as 3 cp and the 194 as 2 cp (that is, the 168 is supposed to be 50% brighter).  But that does not match what my eyes tell me.Anyway, I am pleased with the additional brightness of these 194 replacements, for my turn signal.  For inside map lights, license plate lights, etc., it is going to be personal preference. I prefer lots of bright clear light - some might find them too bright.  But at this price point, I had no problem buying a 10 pack of each (even though I only needed 2 of the 194s), to experiment with them.

Very nice, well-made shifter. I put it in my Dodge Dakota and so far I love it. It feels very solid and fits nicely in my hand. It is very smooth and well-finished. There are a few things to be aware of before purchasing this shifter. First, it is aluminum and though it is anodized, it gets quite hot in a car sitting in the sun to the point of not being able to touch it. It does cool off quickly once you start the vehicle and have the A/C going. Second, the shifter basically forces you to hold it in one particular way. I tend to alter how I hold the shifter all the time and that really isn't possible with this shifter. So far, I don't mind because of how nice it feels, but I'm not sure if I'll eventually tire of it.

These are decent looking wheel covers. My only complaint is that the retaining spring doesn't have a notch to avoid coming in contact with the tire valve. It puts a little pressure on the stem but not enough for concern I hope. Other than that they fit well.*Update 7/22/2015* A week after installing I checked my air pressure since I recently put new tires on. The retaining spring has worn a groove in my valve stems. Not enough to do damage but I didn't want to further the groove. Easy Fix. I removed them and used vise grips to bend the spring slightly where the valve stem goes. Not a problem now. I've been on bad roads and bumps and still secure.

These work for Toyota Tundra calipers with 13WL casting marks. The casting marks are near the bleeder screw holes.Don't be fooled by the Russell or Amazon part finder that says you need the M10x1.00mm thread bleeder! You actually need the M7x1.00mm thread bleeder for the front and rear.Only thing I don't understand about these speed bleeders is the thread sealant. The OEM bleed screws don't have thread sealant, why do these? Seems like a possible failure point for a part that's unscrewed and then tightened repeatedly.

I've been using these on my 2003 Harley V-Rod and I would rate them as satisfactory. They are mostly used to store my rain gear, spare pair of classes and extra half helmet. Some of the seams are starting to come loose which is disappointing. I like the look of these saddle bags but as far as durability goes they don't appear to be standing the elements well. I've attached a picture of one of the seams which is coming apart.

I usually run with HIDs but I decided to give these a shot, they work best since the ballast is on the bulb vs the HID which is desperate box. Its a streamline way to upgrade to LED but will require curing the dust boot to make if work, I had to on both my car and motorcycle.

UPDATED 2/21/14:So today I noticed that both bulbs have begun to fail. The driver's side lamp CREE projector bulb on the tip no longer lights up, and two of the 4 SMD bulbs on the passenger's side no longer light up. I have dropped my review down to 2 stars to reflect this. If only one bulb had failed I would simply order another set, as they were otherwise exactly what I was looking for - but since both have failed I will just look for a more reliable alternative.==Original Review==I have installed these in the parking lights (located in the top half of the fog light housing) on my 2013 Mini Cooper S Roadster.They perfectly match the HID Bi-Xenons in color, and these are VERY BRIGHT. I've been running them for a few days now without any flickering/flashing or bulb-out warning (likely because these are drawing 13W).I ran the bulbs for 10-15 minutes outside of the housing to ensure that they didn't run hot. Neither the wire, or the bulb reach temperatures that concern me. Fairly warm to the touch, but not burning-hot. They don't seem as hot as the factory bulbs they replaced, either.I plan on ordering another set in the next couple days to try in my reverse lights - they are THAT bright. I'd say they are a good 400+ lumens per bulb, and they really give the car a good look.Very glad to have found what seems to be a great product at a reasonable price.

It doesnt exactly look like brushed steel but its pretty close and still looks pretty cool. The 3M Vvivid non-gloss Carbon Fiber roll i bought was mor impressive and accurate on its looks. So I give this brushed steel 4 stars. Still has the great 3M quality as would be expected.

You can immediately tell when picking this thing up (it has some weight to it) that it is solidly designed and built. It feels very high quality. The can is sealed with an o-ring to prevent t from leaking. The 1/2 ID adapters (2 of them) that come with it are plastic, I bough some 3/8ID aluminum ones from eBay so the size matched the PCV lines that come from my PCV valve and port on my intake manifold.-1 Star for the flimsy mount and 2 small sheet metal screws that come with it...they could have easily made it thicker for increased rigidity. I pre-drilled some holes and mounted it to the firewall on my 2010 Hyundai Genesis Coupe 3.8. The amount of oil/water/fuel mix it caught was after 135 miles of highway driving.

My old stock radio was on the firtz, and the replacement I picked up was a single DIN stereo.  The Metra installation kit easily allows you to resize the original double DIN slot, giving you a spot to install your stereo, and a nice cubby for personal storage.  I figured I could store my phone here while I commute.The face plate is made from ABS plastic and due to how it sits over the car stereo, and it's painted it to match your interior without much chance of the radio scratching it up.  When I first started installing it, I had some problems.  Turns out I didn't remove the extra bezel on the stereo, so I originally couldn't get the top half to sit properly.  After I removed the bezel, the face-plate snapped right on, and is holding the receiver tightly in place.  There are no screws, nuts or bolts.  It came with an radio mounting bracket, but I didn't end using it.  Instructions were also included for those who need them.  As you long as you remember it goes over the installed radio, it's fairly easy to see how the two snaps fit into place.I usually replace a double DIN stereo with a double DIN stereo.  I wasn't sure on how it was going to look in comparison to the original stereo, but now that I'm done, I'm very happy with the look and feel of the face-plate.

so far so good, it looks solid with a metal ring fitment plate, no loose parts....I just spend $280 on a new light housing unit because it was damaged from a cheap plastic made led light from autolizer vendor that was cracked. who took 0 responsibility of their cheap flea market quality auto parts and their customer services is the worst.... SO the only thing I didn't like was this split wire instead of a traditional plug, since my car have very little room to work with one handed job. I hope it's not going to give me any problem.

Rugged construction and a perfect fit.  An excellent stylish look with how it complements the nerf bar bumper guard I also purchased on Amazon.  The nerf bar and hitch use the same mount points on the frame so there will be an interference fit.  However, the nerf bar mounting arms are flexible enough to bend them slightly outward so it will fit around the outside of the hitch.  The four 35mm long mounting bolts that fit into the bottom holes should be replaced with 40mm long bolts to make up the additional you will need if you install the nerf bar.

It looks great!!! The fob works well and feels durable.  The reason for the 3 stars and not 5 is because the key is not retained as well as the OEM Saab key fob. This aftermarket fob allows the key to slide out easily. It really makes me nervous.

I am very happy with these mats. After reading so many reviews (most good, some bad) I decided to take a chance and just order them. I'm glad I did. They do not look cheap, they fit the area, they're heavy and rugged, and I didn't pay $130.  Perhaps the bad reviews came from those with larger vehicles like SUVs.

First off the threaded bushings in the plastic mount spin freely and fall out when you try to bolt it in (not excessive tork- spun before the bolt head was seated). Seller was great and, after confirming with a pic, they sent me a new housing. I had the same problem with 2 of the bushings in the new mount even after I cleaned the threads with a tap and oil for good measure. I had to use some Marine epoxy to make it work and was able to get it installed. Put bike away for winter a week after install, and after 3 rides this year I noticed several of the leds are out already. Seller won't do anything because it's been over 3 months. I doubt I have 10 hours on the light. Save your money and don't wasn't your time with this item. JUNK!

Even though it's not the exact dampeners for my 50 inch curved lightbar, I ended up making it fit. It's snuggled tightly within the heat fins(whatever you call them). It is best to spray water onto the dampeners for easy install and gently use a flat head screw driver to open up the fins. But overall, they worked and no more whistling, especially when driving over 70mph.

The ventshades are okay on a CRV. I read the instructions and followed as suggested. A trial fit will ensure placement before peeling off the tape. I found the supplied alcohol pads to be a little on the small side. Video instructions was helpful. Overall fitting on the vehicle is ok. One of the back windows keeps running into the ventshades when I tested after installation. Hopefully that will stop once the tape is permanently set. Easy to install.

These are as bright as the standard halogens they replaced.  Just for looks, thats why I gave them 3 stars.  I used the installed yellow oring on my 12 f150, no issues.

There is one area where most motorcycle manufacturers are completely clueless and that's comfortable seats.I purchased one of these covers for my 2016 FLRT and it made a huge difference.As you can see from the pictures it doesn't completely cover the entire seat on my bike - needs to 3" - 4" longer.Prior to installing this cover after about 30 minutes of riding I felt like I had Hemorrhoids the size of basketballs.This cover adds a very welcomed level of comfort.I rated it 5 stars because it does increase the comfort level despite being a little too short.

If you have a car or truck within the years recommended for this unit, it's a must. Makes things easy to check an locate problems. Why pay a dealer 125.00 to check a code,when for 25.00 you can check it yourself an put the money towards the parts needed. Make sure you get the cable, pricey but worth it.Tested a 1992 Ford F-150 4.9/6 2WD

Bought 2 sets for front and back seats.  The red really makes JKU pop!  Easy to install and look great!  Now kids and wife can get in easier.UPDATE installed first of the rear door and one of the plastic buckles broke. Going to try and find metal buckles for all 4 handles :-(

These Nerf bars look and work great. They are pretty easy to install and seem to be quite sturdy. The stainless Steel seems to be holding up well after a few months, and works well with a Chrome Package. You can't beat the price.

Good quality build. I have this mounted on the windshield of my 2016 Jeep Rubicon JKU, and it is very bright a good combination of spot/flood. There is wind noise when driving over 40mph as the wind goes through the cooling fins, this is easily fixed by using a rubber noise damper (rubber inserts that go between the fins). All in all I would recommend this light bar, solid product at a good price.

I bought these to replace the cabin filters in my 2000 Sierra as they had never been replaced in 17 years and 289,000 miles. I even put up a video on YouTube showing the simple 5min process. They are an exact replacement and seem like better quality than the OEM. My heat air flow is much better now.

What an upgrade for my 1993 Mazda RX7. These lights hum slightly in the housing, due to the internal fan however this is a lot quiter than some hid lights. The light beam is bright and the cutoff seems good, I do have to adjust them to see the full light set and beam pattern. Otherwise on day one these Lasfit lights seems good. They are bright in reflective housings projectors would be better but they do not scatter like HID's in reflective housings but not as clean as Halogen lights in the stock housings.Two things to note, there are no instructions (I assume the lights faces upwards as the fans are on the bottom) and the website listed does not seem valid any more. So I guess the only warranty you shall get is on amazon?

This was installed on my 2002 Harley Davidson Night Train. The headlight is a 5.75 bulb in a small housing making it a bit of a trial & error to get everything to fit... But it did. During the day time, I could tell the light was whiter (Very Important) and brighter than incandescent the bulb it replaced.This morning I bit the bullet in this cool weather to take her out to truly test the light output & pattern.Let me make one thing perfectly clear. I am very knowledgeable when it comes to LED bulbs. Everything in my home, car & now Harley has LED bulbs, I understand the Lumen's and the different colors they are capable of producing. This bulb did very well. On low beam, the bottom of the beam pattern is edgy? or wavy like. However, this has very little to no effect on your view. The top center is a bit darker than I would like but I can still see further than with the stock bulb. The side to side is excellent! This is VERY important to me due to the amount of animals the are in my area, from deer to possums. both will kill you if you hit them at highway speeds. Now when switching to high beam, The center really lights up! This is the best I have ever seen besides using HID lighting which I don't suggest on a motorcycle due to the amp draw, bulb heat, ballast mounting problems, & blinding everyone.So in short I am pleased with the results per dollar spent & highly suggest everyone replace ALL bulbs on their motorcycles with LED bulbs as I have. They are brighter making it easier for dumbassses to see you, Plus they operate cooler, have a VERY low amp draw making it easier on your charging system & they last much longer.Just an observation... The stock bulb & reflector are NOT designed for LED use, The european bulbs & reflectors should work much better due to their prism style light reflectors, controlling the light patter much better & helping to prevent scatter in the eyes of oncoming traffic.If I find a reasonable european headlight housing to replace the old style one I'm currently using, I'll update this review with the results.FYI:When it comes to LED's,1) Look for the lumens (Brightness) and choose COB LED's (Chip ON Board) as these types of LED are more efficient & brighter.2) Choose a color, (Measured in Kelvins) that are from 5000-6000 K. This is much closer to daylight, thus allowing you to see further. Anything higher gets into the blue to purple, which is USELESS!! If you go below 5000K, you head in the yellow colors, which is no better than the regular bulbs.You will find using 5000-6000K bulbs in your house will make it better lit and even easier to read! (Trust me on that one) Your eyes don't have to work as hard. Plus the whiter light helps promote a more positive atmosphere.The next evolution is Lasers Headlights, If you mix the right amount of Red, Blue & Green, you get a nice bright white, much brighter than what any LED is capable of producing thus far. BMW is working on prototypes & may even have them in production by now. At least I hope so. I'll be in my local scrap yards to acquire one to modify for my car & bike.I added a before & after pictures of the headlight upgrade, but it fails to actual show the difference. However, Bet you can tell the front Running Lights/Turn Signals have been updated with some high quality LED's!Any questions? This old man will be more than happy to answer them.

Not able to use both pipes, so I used it as a short CAI instead. After the install it worked well, but if I knew I was not able to use the full length of the pipes, I would have just purchased a short cold air intake and saved some money. I found a short CAI for only $28 on eBay and could have saved $20. Overall, I feel and notice a better throttle response. Sounds good!!!!-1993 Honda Accord LX

Easy 30 minute install, Fired it up and Instantly noticed a difference. From idle through to 3500rpm This definitely makes a difference. This is installed on a 2000 Jeep Cherokee XJ Sport 4.0L. I coupled the Install with an aFe Stage 2 Air Intake system . Will be following up in a couple months to see how the mileage is affected. This was a perfect  under the hood upgrade.UPDATE ..... The performance has been awesome. When off road and climbing it nice not to have to push harder it makes crawling and climbing much easier on the  throttle. Fuel mileage seems to have remained constant at 21 highway and around 17 city and off-road well.... depends on what your doing. I have let a few people drive my XJ and the first thing that say is what did I do because its so crisp and responsive. Even My Repair Shop Mechanic is interest in getting one now for his Jeep!Update 8/22/2017 .... The Performance is still there And A lot had changed on my Xj including Rehearing to 4.10 with lockers, 33's $.5 Inch Lift. Average mileage has been around 16.5. The main thing is the power it has on an engine with 250,000 miles on it. I am going toe upgrading the exhaust this winter to a complete Banks system with 12 port injectors ...

These vent visors are easy to install, however, make sure that you know exactly where you want to put these visors. Once you take off the tape covering and you stick it on the car, there is no taking it back.  Visor comes with small alcohol squares to use to clean the surface where you plan to mount the visors. Since the visors are made to fit over hatch windows, make sure you place the correct ones over the left and right windows. The narrow end of the visor goes toward the front of the window. If you place it on the back, you will not be able to open the rear windows. The visors will look great on your truck. I highly recommend these to anyone who wants to add some style and personalize their truck.

Could be better or worse. Depends on ones tolerance as the frame does water spot. I replaced the included screws for stainless as the coastal area where I live is hard on anything metal. I later removed the frame after the photos, cleaned and sprayed with clear coat. I'll probably look for a chrome frame and put this on my pick-up. Was an easy install and the plastic screw cap/covers simply snap on and snap off just as easy. You can find about the same quality frame and price point at any local auto parts store and the "blue" department store.Typical Amazon Prime efficiency!

I have this mounted on my 10 foot utility trailer. I fabricated and welded an additional mounting plate to face tongue side of the trailer to mount the winch on. I mainly use this for lawnmowers and small tractors that do not run to get them on the trailer. I haven't had any problems and it pulls whatever I have needed it to. A huge perk for me, and the main reason I purchased this particular winch is that it uses the same controller as my 8000 pound Suerwinch on my car trailer so I don't have to carry different controllers for the two winches.For powering the winch, I have 25' of 6 gauge pure copper cable with clamps&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Road-Power-400C-2-500-Amps-Booster-Cable-Clamps-Red-Black-2-Pack/dp/B000BPTUJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Road Power 400C-2 500-Amps Booster Cable Clamps, Red/Black, 2-Pack</a>&nbsp;on one end, and mini Anderson style connectors&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/HYCLAT-6-10-GAUGE-Battery-Quick-Connect-Disconnect-Wire-Harness-Plug-Connector-Recovery-Winch-Trailer/dp/B01KHQQY7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">HYCLAT 6-10 GAUGE Battery Quick Connect/Disconnect Wire Harness Plug Connector Recovery Winch Trailer</a>&nbsp;on the ends of the cables to connect them. I store this cable along with the controller in a small toolbox&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Better-Built-67011386-ATV-Tool-Box/dp/B004Q040XI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Better Built 67011386 ATV Tool Box</a>&nbsp;that is mounted on the tongue of the trailer. This way when I use the trailer, it doesn't matter which truck I use, I will have what I need to power the winch. I can also loan the trailer out to friends or family, and they will have what is needed.I have used the winch about 30 times as of the review and it is holding up very well and I am happy with it. I only have 2 small complaints. First, it is slow, but it beats having to move dead equipment, especially 2000 pound tractors, or using a cable puller. Second is the freespooling control. It's a bit different and sticks every now and then, but is minor. I can always use power to run the winch out.Long story short, it works very well and if I would need a second winch of this capacity, I will no doubt buy another one.

Used this to cover all 4 door panels completely. This product is very sticky and easy to apply. I am comparing this to GTMatt that I used in my trunk and under my back seat. Dynamat is way more expensive and I would say both products work about the same. Definitely could tell there was significantly reduced road noise when driving and no more rattle when the midbass hits. My doors sound much more solid when closing now and are even quieter on the outside of the car.

I have to say I was a bit worried these would give my truck a euro look which I think is corny but I was wrong.  These look great.  I had them installed by a professional but I'm sure it's simple enough to do by yourself.  I just lack patience.  One tip.  You will need a relay for the blinkers because they flash super fast almost like a flashing strobe light.  I got the relay at an auto parts store for $7.00

I was considering giving it a lower star rating since the stands were a little scratched and i didn't like that but I went with 5/5 because of how fast I got them and they are super strong and how easy it was to install, so all I can say is I love it and my bike loves it too.I will add that I had my own spools so I didn't used the ones that came with it.

Very happy with it. Wasn't expecting much for the price but it fits great and even though there's the slightest color difference, you can hardly tell. When removing the old one, be sure to check where the handle clips go into and make sure that none broke off and stayed in from the old handle (it took me a while to figure out why I couldn't fit new handle in, old clips remained inside the inserts where they clip into)Great purchase!

Installed on a 2014 Ram Big Horn Quad Cab.I recently purchased my Ram and this product was recommended to me.  I was a bit hesitant because I didn't want to dismantle the truck I just bought days before.  To my surprise this isn't as involved as one may think.  Between 2 views of a YouTube video and the detailed instructions I was able to install this no problem.  I do suggest to not crumple the yellow waxy paper and toss it like I did initially.  That is actually mylar used to protect paint from rubbing parts.***After 1 month of being installed it still is working great.  The protective mylar has worn through though, even being doubled up on the wear/rubbing areas.

These LED light bulbs are a heck of a purchase. Sure they are a little more expensive that incandescent but they are worth it once installed. I bought these to make my AMC Javelin flashy when backing up. These sure did the job and I am happy with them. I have purchased LED plasma lights before and I could not find the ones for my application so I decided on these. I am including a side by side comparison (pics attached) so that you can see if these might be good for you or not.One tip, please make sure that the inlet that these go into is big enough as Philips did make them a little wider than the original incandescent.

Pros: Did last over a week.Cons: Not sling free as advertised.I purchased this product specifically because of the sling free claim in the description of this product.  I have used several other products and was looking for a product that didn't spray off onto the side of my car. I have used other Chemical Guys products before and usually their stuff is quality and as advertised.  It also doesnt leave much of a gloss finish on the tire (more of a matt finish).Meguiars gel has been the best so far, but had major sling of dirt onto my paint finish. All the products I tried had sling of dirt the first drive after application and then was good after that.Chemical Guys tire product was the only one that claimed to be sling free and messed my paint twiceonce after application and then again after I wiped off and detailed the car. I did follow the instructions precisely and had the same result four times, which is very disappointing, especially because they are the only company to make a claim that it won't spray off.

Bought this box based on the picture and the description/dimensions. Very confusing. After receiving the box, very obvious that it was different from the picture. I called the manufacture and they informed me the lid was re-designed approx a year ago. Not beveled any more, 90 degree edges. Seems to be a well made box, top is insulated with about 1/2 inch of injected foam between aluminum. I posted pictures and dimensions. Hope Amazon takes note and up-grades their descriptions! Nice box, made in USA11-2-2015 UPDATE ;  JUST BOUGHT MY SECOND BOX, JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST; HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOX. The latch is Stainless Steel, a plus over other brands.JULY 12, 2016 UPDATE ;  Just bought my 3rd box, got it today (I have too many trailers). This one just as good as the first, no damage, no defects, everything works fine. The last two boxes are perfect, no issues, no problems. I am careful with my stuff and don't lend my trailers (if you want to keep them in good shape). This box is the best I havefound as far as design, quality, and overall appearance. I like the low profile, holds everything I need. I again recommend this box and will buy again if needed (yes, I have more trailers).OCTOBER 30, 2017 UPDATE ;  I NOW HAVE 3 OF THESE, I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH ANY OF THEM. ONE THING I NOTICE SOME PEOPLE DO, IS SLAM THE LID SHUT....THIS WOULD PROBABLY SHORTEN THE LIFE OF ANY BOX. IF I EVER NEED ANOTHER BOX, THIS WOULD BE IT. HOPE THE QUALITY STAYS THE SAME!!!

~More detailed experience below~Pros:C.A.R.B. Exempt/Approved, Legal for sale and use in CaliforniaEasy, straight forward, instructions and installationLooks fantasticDropped a second on my 0-100mph time (from 15 to 14 seconds)Noticeable, very deep and mean sound when flooring the throttle (wife loves the rumble)Cons:Filter fit, but barely in vehicle (corner edge of filter is pressed against front frame but not damaging filter)Read below, but a couple of minor things were incorrect in instructionsHad to do research and contact Airaid to get a definite answer on C.A.R.B. ApprovalI purchased this cold air intake for my 2012 Dodge Charger R/T Plus. I live in California and was concerned about the new C.A.R.B. law, there are C.A.R.B. Exempt cold air intakes out there, but I couldn't find a definite answer on this model. I contacted Airaid and their support assured me it would come with an exemption sticker, luckily it did and I can tell you that this cold air intake is legal for sale and use in California. It took me a little under an hour from very start to very finish. My engine now has a very deep and mean rumble, especially when you floor it. A couple of minor things that were annoying: one, there's a large bolt that screws into Airaid's rubber filler at the back bottom, the instructions say to use the screw and large washer, I was screwing and pushing very hard but the thread couldn't reach, took off the washer and it worked fine, so the washer wasn't needed; second, the instructions say to remove the vehicles fender screw, that's fine, but they say it's 6mm, maybe for 2011, but my vehicle's screw was 10mm. Minor, but those things matter. All-in-all, for my first time installing a cold air intake, this was very simple and easy to do, worth every penny for the finished look and sound. I will also upload some pictures. Please comment and I will answer to the best of my ability.

Put these on my 09 883 custom. It sounds like a harley should, with that sound that is not copied elsewhere. Also added a Screaming Eagle high volume intake and had a stage one tune put on it. The difference is very noticeable. More power more acceleration. This is what a motorcycle should sound like. I was told at the local Harley dealership that cycle shack used to make the Screaming Eagles for them.

The product works as described and has already become an indispensable part of my toolset for DIY auto maintenance. I recently used it during an oil change on my 2005 Honda Accord V6 (see customer picture I posted) and it worked great. It's very easy to flex and mold around suspension parts which prevented a mess when changing out the oil filter on this car. I was able to channel the oil over and around the suspension to drain to my oil catch pan so cleanup was a breeze. Just wipe it down with a shop towel when you're done and it's good to go for the next time. There's really nothing else like it as far as I know so it's already one of my favorite tools because of it.

If your A/C takes forever to get cold and there's barely any air coming out of the vents like mine did, then look no further... Time to change the cabin air filter.Great value with this carbon activated filter. Do yourself a favor and spend the 5 extra bucks for carbon.Bought it for my 2006 Hyundai Sonata, it fits perfectly. For that vehicle, you want to detach the glove box by first pulling out to the right, with a screw driver, the black ring you can see through a hole to the right of the glove box when opened, and then pull towards you the two clips inside the glove box itself after lifting them off slightly but without forcing with a flat head screwdriver. Tada, the glove box drops down to the floor, and you get access to the air filter holder, which you want to squeeze by the two tabs, using both hands, and pull towards you. There might be some resistance, but do insist.Just bought my vehicle recently, and the filter had not been changed in years. Truly a disgusting view. Years old dead bugs, leaves, and lots of dirt. A real shame most owners are so "mechanically" inept that they can't spend $15 and spend 2 minutes changing the filter. You're supposed to do it every year by the way, or every 12,000 mi.I've included pictures from the "unhooked" glove box and the air filter from the previous owner... Gives you an idea what kind of ugly mess full of bacteria and mold might be blowing to your face at the moment...

Awesome hitch! perfect fit. As for anyone who says you can't get the bolts through the frame. Well, spend an extra 5 minutes to take off the 4 17mm bolts that hold your bumper beam in place, a few Philips head screws and some clips to take the bumper cover and bumper beam off. There will be more than enough room for those bolts. Plus it is much easier to get the hitch on there without the bumper there. Don't tighten the hitch up completely because you will not have enough room to put those two bottom plastic clips on the bottom of the bumper cover. Once you have those installed, then tighten every bolt up and you'll have a hitch on your Civic!

Worked better than I expected, my bmw has a lot grime and dirt build up. I finally was able to text this product, I suprised of how much dirt it was able to remove with little effort, just spray tires with water and then product, used a tire brush and brushed away the build up with easy. I used firm but not hard pressure when brushing but the build up came off with easy. Will be recommending this and using this again. Now my tires look like new! Took about 10 mins total for all 4 wheels to be cleaned.

I took the advice of a previous reviewer and weather sealed this light with clear silicon before installing it on my Jeep. I removed the three screws on each side and sealed around the edges of the end caps. There is a rubber gasket to help seal it, but I'm not sure how strong it is. I also sealed along the outside of the lens and the frame. There a bit of a gap and the silicon fills it very easily. I did all of this just to be sure the light lasts for a while. You get what you pay for and I think adding a bit more weather protection will help with its longevity. I don't have much experience caulking things, but it's not hard.To eliminate the annoying whistle you get with a light bar traveling at higher speeds I added three strips of door trim guard. This worked perfectly. I used Rigid Industries brackets to mount the bar. I had to buy some extra hardware to make this work. I use a M6 - 30mm hex screw to adjust for length. The screws that came with the bar were to long. I also added washers and a locking bolt to each side. This wasn't much of an added cost.Over all I like the look of this light bar. It's super bright. I've taken it through car washes and have driven it in the rain and had no issues.

I thought I was buying 2 d-bags... but got these d-rings instead... I enjoy these much more as they will do more work.  Had to grind the pins down a bit to fit my mounts, but that may be my bad dawg... I'd buy these again

So far it works great, i tested the kit before doing anything, all of the strips work great, they're bright as hell! besides the red it is a little dull.  the remote is pretty responsive. only thing that could be better is the sound activated mode, not quite that responsive but so far so good. For the price you cant complain.

I ordered this passenger side mirror cover and received the driver side by mistake.  No worries I thought, I'll exchange.  My package came in today and I now have 2 DRIVER SIDE covers. Both of which I'll have to repackage and return.  Someone either isn't checking their shipments or they have these mislabeled.  It's already an expensive piece of plastic so it would be nice to have the correct part arrive.Attached are 2 photos.  The first picture shows the 2 covers I received from amazon next to my driver mirror, and the second picture shows one of the covers next to my passenger mirror.

I tried other cheap led bulbs and they keep going bad after a couple of months. These are not as bright but still at 6000K. Also these have the right amount of brightness for the map lights. One last thing, these will work no matter the polarity (not such a big deal but it is a plus to just put them in and not having to flip them for the polarity). UPDATE 4/22/2018 - I just wanted to say that after a year of using these in the car I had no problem with any of them. The light level is just right and at no point I felt that I needed more light than this. Finally, I attached a picture of the back side of the box because I think that it has info you will find useful.

These horns are extremely amazing quality and of worthy value! My husband absolutely loves these. He was amazed at quality of the material, thickness & durability. He will be attaching them to his Big Rig! The sound out of the box is loud and clear! Great Product! Love it. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review. Highly recommend these horns and this BRAND.

Easiest applying wax I've ever used.  I opted to put a spray top on the bottle and put the bottle into a bucket of warm water for 15 minutes or so to loosen it up a bit.  Spray onto the pad of my DA, and spread about on super slow speed.  Let stand until it hazes and buff off with a microfiber cloth.  By applying with spray you keep the coat nice and thin, which is really all you need.Great water beading action.  Highly recommend using the spray bottle technique.

Installed it on my 2013 Infiniti FX37 within 30-40 min on all four doors. Easy! Great Product! Good Protection! Adds nice look too.4/8/15 UpdateAfter 6 month the glue that was inside started melting to the outside of the door guards and makes it look really bad. Another thing those door edge guards shrink with the time as well.If you're planning to add this and then sell the car, then do it. Otherwise don't buy it.I'm sitting right now at a Auto Detail Cleaning shop. And they're going to charge me an extra $60 just in order to remove all this spread glue on my doors with a heat gun and the to polish & buff it.Check out the photos. This is not just dirt, it's the glue. And how much it shrunken.

Rather than pay three times as much for a multi-step kit that can take up to an hour of work per headlight, I opted for this inexpensive and simple alternative.  Not only did it WORK on my sister's 2007 Corolla's 100,000 mile, VERY yellowed and foggy headlight covers, it worked in just FIVE MINUTES PER COVER!  And I used only 1/3rd of the 10oz bottle!  So my cost was $2 and time was ten minutes.  The covers went from under 50% light transmission to at least 90%.  With the lights on at night, standing in front of the car, you can still see a bit off fogginess, but when driving the lights work great!I used a small foam pad from a car wax kit for application and a small, slightly damp terry cloth hand towel.  I used the towel to promptly wipe off any cleaner that got on the paint, and after rubbing generous amounts of cleaner on each lens cover for five minutes, I wiped the cover dry with the towel while the cleaner was still wet, as directed on the bottle.  It can't get easier than this!  Of course, the result can only improve if you want to spend more time scrubbing, or, if you want perfection, spend the money and even more time on those other kits.See my "before" and "after" photos above!ADDENDUM (11 Jul 13): I just found on EHOW dot COM that a 3 to 1 ratio of toothpaste to baking soda will do the same job.  Wash lenses first with dish soap and afterwards with baking soda in water (rinse well after each wash).  I'll try it and let ya know!

I'll adjust the review if the replacement I've just requested comes in and work a little better than the one I originally recieved. My only problem is that the display isn't legible.Charger works fine and I'm happy with the automatic functions such as the reconditioning mode that helps desulfate the batter and the float charging after.The fact that you can use the supplied clamps to hook to any battery as well as permanently install leads in your battery to make regular maintenance a more efficient process is also a big plus.I look forward to keeping my yellow top battery healthy for hopefully another 4 years.

*****8 month update******As mentioned I completely resealed my light bar and it has zero fog issues, even after 12,000 miles and hard off road use.  I've had other friends purchase the high dollar rough country units and they are not even close to mine in brightness.  I have zero dead led's and no fog.  Remember to disassemble and inspect and re seal all components****************Purchased this with prime and it arrived promptly.  Box was torn but the unit itself was undamagedOut of the box when I picked it up I noticed there was some rattling, I knew I was going to re seal it with clear rtv sealant anyways but it was an obvious defect.  As I took the unit apart it was obvious there was no quality controlPro:  cheap and functions properly.Cons: while dis assembling the 52 inch light bar I noticed that no 2 bolts were the same length on the exterior or interior of the unit.  It was odd because some bolts would fit one place and others wouldn'tOnce inside the unit I found loose screws, and I'm not just talking hand tight, the rattling noise I heard was an extra screw just sitting there.I re tightened all screws and re sealed it and drove 800 miles without any problems.I made my own brackets to mount at the top of the winshield which then used the supplied brackets.So it was a cheap Chinese unit.  Re assembly required

The product was had a manufacture issue to there the holes had to be re drilled out after spending hours trying to figure it out. If you buy one buy a small drill bit too and take the little screw out and pull the valve out and drill out the extra piece of metal what is in the main out port . I bought 2 of these and both of them had the same issue

I bought this a s used from Amazon, it said like new. It was brand new, only the box was damaged. I got $12 off for a hole in the box that I threw away 10 minutes after I got it. Bonus for me.On to the stand. I'm going to give it 5 stars for the price and ease of assembly. It took literally 5 minutes to put together with no directions. Pretty self explanatory. I will recommend that you use Loctite on the bolts, even though they are self locking. And once you get the spacing set up tighten the bolts for the spool mounts. It is very sturdy and the finish is very good. It supports my Triumph Street Triple well enough for me to sit on the bike while on the stand.  I didn't buy the front stand because a friend gave me a Venom front stand that he can't use. This stand is just as well made, maybe not Pitbull quality, but it's not overpriced like a Pitbull stand either. I would highly recommend this stand.

Wish I never would have tried this. I used it to paint the underside of a vintage truck bed I'm restoring. Prepped the surface exactly as instructions specified but after less than 3 years surface rust is leaching through the paint everywhere. So I had to remove the bed again and now I'm stripping this garbage product off - it peels off in pieces - and I'm going to use an epoxy bed liner instead. Upol is about the same price and it works so much better.

I used VHT Paint (Primer, Satin Black, and Clear) to restore my motorcycle wheels which had over 100,000 miles on them and looked pretty beat up.I really like working with VHT spray paint and is my first choice for a number of different applications from brake parts to engine blocks.  So when I was looking for paint to restore my wheels, I turned to VHT.This paint spray nicely - and dries to the touch in 30 minutes.  They suggest two light coats followed by one medium coat allowing 10 minutes in between coats.  All coats should be applied within 1 hour.  Any additional coats after the one hour - you need to wait 7 days for the paint to cure.This is about the only spray paint I have found that you can actually use rubbing compound to polish out the final coat and achieve a really smooth, glossy surface.  My wheels look like brand new

She saysOf all things, we got these for the very first Boy from this side of the family. Our daughter and her husband moved to California and complained about the sun affecting our 1 yr old grandson, making him grumpy on long car rides. We got these to aid them so he can still see out his window, but not be beaten on by the sun. We've gotten a big thank you for these as he is not so cranky in the back seat anymore like he was, allowing for easier drives. Apparently they cling to the window well and minus a bit of fumbling to fit back into the carry bag they come with (they struggled a bit, but finally figured it out), they are really happy with these.He saysI ordered these for our middle daughter who has her first 1 year old and our first grandson (have 2 grand daughters). So when she and her husband recently moved to Sunny, yes Sunny Southern California I knew I had to give my grandson some help. Being their minivan does not have tinted windows (thanks Dodge (eye roll)). Being I noticed in a few pictures our grandson was darker on his left side than his right, we knew he was getting tanned from sitting in his car seat in the back. So the wife and I opted to get these cling sun shades for the back windows to protect the little guy yet still allow him to see out. And we knew we didn't want the suction cup type as they never last. And being a recent tablet holder is a static cling type of adhesion, we opted for these. So far so good, our daughter says they stick fine even in the sun all day. Just a matter of cleaning your window and pressing the sunshade on, it is that easy. She says they are lightweight and a bit of a learning curve to fold them back up, but once figured out they fit in their pouch nicely and tuck into the pocket on the back of the seat. So an evenly tanned grandson was the purpose here and that was accomplished, thats a win!To give our quirky and honest opinion of this product, we received a discount. We give nothing but our unbiased opinion, being we expect the same in return. No greenbacks were traded for this review nor does Amazon or the seller influence our decisions. Did we help you?

I was recently in a rollover accident in my truck. Hanging upside down my seatbelt would not release.  After my initial shock from the impact and some panic over not being able to get out of my seatbelt the green handle of the cutter caught my eye. Because it was on the outside of my visor it was easily accessible. I was quite shocked how easily this cut through the seatbelt. This cutter is no joke. Even though I still had to be cut out of my truck be emergency personnel I was able to move enough that I was not in the way as much as I would have been if I was still stuck in the seatbelt. I have now put one of these in everyone's car that I care about. My wife said the bright green is somewhat distracting but agree that in a panic situation she would be much more likely to remember it was there.I highly recommend this product and would never drive a car without one of these on the driver side visor.Including a rental car. Very easy installation. The picture is the one in my Dodge Challenger.

Like other people, I too saw the videos on clearing foggy headlights using Mothers, and figured I would try it on my 13 year old Rav4's headlights.Took less then 5 mins each using a drill buffer. I am very pleased with the results. After the first light was done I took a picture of the completed light and the non-treated on and posted here. it's hard to see how good it worked, as they look better then the picture shows. I don't know how long it will last, but if I need to do every 6 months, that's fine with me to see at night.

Let me start by saying, I already own two Honda eu2000i generators, so my review is heavily influenced by comparison to these machines.Pros:- The noise level is very comparable to the eu2000i, almost imperceptable, however the tone is not as low as the eu2000i.- Tested it with 500w halogen and an 1,875 watt hair dryer on high. The generator performed flawlessly with the load.- Very easy to start. Added oil, filled fuel tank and it fired on the second pull.- Lighter than my eu2000iCons:- There is no good place for a tach/hour meter, there are only 3 small access covers that can be removed without disassembling the case and none of them provide enough room for the meter face (might need to try removing the entire side to see if there's a good place under there)- Spark plug was gapped incorrectly from the factory (.02 vs. 03 inches)- There was some type of oil that leaked out of the bottom, it was not crankcase oil, so maybe a preservative from the windings or from the outside of the engine block? I don't know, but it left a mess on my patio. I do know it was not engine oil as the oil was full and the what leaked was not golden in color like the oil in the crankcase.- Gas fill opening is small, really only works well with a 1 gallon container, any larger container is a real pain to use refilling.- Unlike the eu2000i this unit seems to pick up cooling air from the bottom and not just from the front and sides as the eu2000i does. This provides greater risk of overheating when stationed on loose surfaces where stuff can get pulled into the cooling passages. I'd actually like to hear from Westinghouse whether this should be a concern.Overall this is an excellent performing generator and a fantastic value! The engine seems to be a yamaha clone and based on Westinghouse's website there is a good network of service centers across the U.S. I'll try to remember to come back and update this review as I put more hours on the unit.UPDATE 8-31-16I found a great place to mount the tach/hour meter on this thing. It's not visible from the outside, but only requires 4 screws to be removed to get to it (I don't reference it very often anyway and like keeping it out of the way). I mounted it behind the front intake air grill. There is a plastic piece the extends below the air filter box where the rectifier is attached, and there's just enough space to drill two 1/16th holes and screw the tach/hour meter to it. I then ran the inductive pickup wire back to the spark plug wire and wrapped it several times tying knots in the first wrap and the last wrap then zip tied over the knots to keep the wire from coming loose. See photos, I purchased this tach/hour meter from Amazon and it is working perfectly: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DUD5LUW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Also, it should be noted that the magnetic dipsticks for Yamaha ef2000is generators work in this generator and provide an extra level of protection by collecting any ferris material that is created from wear and suspended in the oil.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017CXO7AQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Pros  Thick Rubber  Easy to Clean  Holds wellCons  They didn't fit in more than 5 places  Rubber mats do not look or feel good on carpeted flooring  Bad customer service  Bad return policyI needed both mats for a 2003 Nissan 350Z.  The website has all sorts of claims about how well their mats fit.  This is not true in my case.They were not a perfect laser-measured fit.  They were not even a good fit.  They gapped in more than 5 places.  I had no intentions to return the mats, and I wanted Weathertech to succeed, so I contacted them by email just to let them know the mats do not fit the 350Z well.When I contacted Weathertech by email, Mr Heisler told me in several emails that I was reviewing the website incorrectly, and if they weren't a perfect fit, they were most certainly a very good fit.  I responded that the website should really make it clearer.  He then sent me screenshots of the website with areas circled where I was quite obviously wrong.  After his 3rd demeaning email on how wrong I was, I showed the mats and emails to several friends who told me flat out to return the mats.They did take the mats back, however I had to eat the shipping, and I didn't see the partial refund for weeks.  For the same amount of money, I bought mats from Nissan.  They were of better quality, and they fit perfectly.Summary:  Had Weathertech treated me better through email, or even returned my shipping (as this was clearly not my fault they sent me mats that didn't fit), I would not have returned the mats, even though they didn't fit.  In addition, Ive talked to others interested in mats, and my experience has cost Weathertech more sales.

I'm thrilled with my new K&N Intake setup.  It's a gorgeous kit (I've posted a picture in the Customer Images section) that's dead simple to install if you're even the tiniest bit mechanically inclined and makes an immediate difference in the power, the sound, and the mileage of your truck.  Whether or not it's worth it to see gains in those departments depends, I suppose, on your expectations...It's an intake kit after all, not a golden goose, so don't expect miracles.  Based on my experience (and my expectations) though, I'm very happy.1. Power:  Nothing huge, but my already peppy truck definitely felt peppier of the line.  I didn't notice any increase under hard acceleration, but throttle response seems more immediate.  For what it's worth, K&N included a Dyno report that showed a marginal increase (3 hp, if I recall correctly) with their kit installed.2. Sound:  A new roar under the hood.  It's not hugely loud, but you can definitely hear it and what you hear sounds real good.  If that concerns you, you're probably not reading reviews on intake kits in the first place.  Putting a Flowmaster Dual on my truck tomorrow for the full experience.3. Mileage: Here's where I got surprised.  I wasn't expecting an increase and was actually expecting a mild decrease (based on my experience with throwing a big intake kit on my motorcycle).  Prior to the install, I was averaging 16.4 mpg.  After the install and driving my 80 mile round trip to work and back twice, I averaged 18.2 mpg with a 20/80 mix of city and highway driving.  Nice!  And that was with me goosing the gas pedal more than I normally would just so I could hear the whoosh.  Anyway, very happy and I'll update here if my mileage changes over the next month or so.So...great kit, easy to install (even with the horrible instruction sheet....just follow the exploded diagram and you'll be fine), and it's not some kind of snake oil that fails to deliver.  If you're thinking about buying one, quit thinking and do it.  You'll thank yourself later.

You can't beat this light for the money.  The day I installed it I drove 300 miles in the rain and it didn't leak at all.  It isn't as bright as my Rigid Dually cube lights but it throws a wider beam.  This light was also 1/5th the price of those little cube lights so I wasn't expecting it to be as bright.

The Bosch #9605 is a DOUBLE IRIDIUM design, which uses an Iridium coating on BOTH electrodes. Another Amazon customer recommended installing Iridium spark plugs in my V-8 engine, so I did a ton of research on the subject in order to get the best plugs for the least money -- and here's what I found out: The Bosch plug is the only DOUBLE-IRIDIUM design that's currently available -- and the only plug that has both of the Iridium-tipped  electrodes laser-welded to the plug . What the illustration doesn't show is that both the center electrode and the ground electrode have iridium surfaces --, which should translate to a superior plug with even longer life than other brands of iridium spark plugs.  The Bosch 9605 comes pre-gapped at 1.3 mm (.052) and does not require re-gapping for most applications. Most factory-gapped plugs are famously inaccurate, but a double-check showed the 9605s to be spot-on in every case. These plugs are marked "Made in Germany" on the box, with the proper gap and tightening torque, also. There is NO anti-seize necessary, as the plug is plated to avoid corrosion while allowing proper torque readings. Use of Permatex Item # 22058 Dielectric Tune-Up Grease (available from Amazon) on the inside of the plug boots prevents boot damage and stops high-voltage terminal corrosion. Use a thin film of dielectric grease on battery posts and terminals to stop corrosion and loss of battery voltage to the electrical system. UPDATE: November, 2016 -- After 20,000 miles and 2 years of service, the Iridium plugs are still providing excellent performance and fuel mileage. Engine starts instantly, and runs smooth and strong. If these ever wear out, I'll buy more !!

I'm very impressed with Meguiar's X2000 "Water Magnet" Microfiber drying towel.  Because I keep my car waxed well, I typically dry my car with a high-powered blower and follow-up with a microfiber towel to get the small areas I've missed.  Because I use Meguiar's Gold Class wax, when I use the blower, the water easily flies off the car.  I've always been averse to drying a car with any type of towel, but this drying towel does a great job and appears safe as long as your car's surface is completely clean of contaminants.After using Meguiar's "Water magnet" I'm very satisfied with the results.  The pictures below are from using it on my son's car.  I found it most effective to open the towel completely and carefully drag it across the car surfaces.  At 22"x30" it covers a large surface area and sucks up the water very well.  It's easy to wring out, and I only had to wring it out 5-6 times to dry his entire car.Like most Amazon shoppers, I count on honest, unbiased reviews.  I hope you have found this review helpful in making your purchase decision.

Very happy with these grips on my TW200. These grips are a bit thicker than usual so provide a great surface to hang onto. They will fit any 7/8 handlebar (which is most motorcycles). The grips have several indentations molded in for safety wire which keeps it away from your hands. Also, the ends are molded for easy cutting if you run bar ends or hand guards like I do.

I love it!  Perfect for valve covers and any parts under the hood you want to spice up.  I have used this stuff a lot and never really follow the silly steps on the can. Instead I just clean/degrease and apply 4 coats with the first being the thinnest.  Beware it does have a strong odor so don't use it in your garage without some good ventilation. Give it a full day to cure before seeing all the fine wrinkles it brings out!

Looks good on the jeep. But the shape does not perfectly match the grill which causes a small gap between the grill and the adhesive on these inserts.  I'm not expecting them to last long, but time will tell

I was upgrading the wheels and tires on my 2014 Jeep Wrangler Willys Wheeler and needed a new set of tire pressure sensors, and after reading some reviews on Amazon I decided to roll with these. They worked perfectly! I provided the 5 sensors to the wheel shop, who then assembled them to the new 18"x9" LRG 106 wheels and then mounted my Cooper STT Pro 37"13.5"-18" tires. Within 2-3 minutes of starting the jeep with the new wheels and tires, the dash went live showing each of 4 tires actual pressure. This is a very good item at a very fair price, if you have a newer JK Wrangler, I strongly recommend these to you. The attached photos are of my wheels and tires with these tire pressure sensors installed.Note that it has been one year now and 12,000 miles. The TPMS sensors all still work fine as we move through 2017. I still recommend these for an inexpensive solution.

Got this battery for my 06 1200 custom and it lasted for less then a year. Cranked up the bike yesterday and it stopped running, I checked the battery and find the negative post came off. Yes, the negative post was totally off the battery just sitting there. I have not had this happen with any battery. The price is cheap but you get what you pay for apparently with this battery. I would suggest another then this one.

Great light in a small package and a low price.I purchased this light and installed on my roof rack as a backup light.  Alone, it does a fantastic job.  I will likely purchase more of these for side/rock lights.Bracket easy to connect to unit and mount to a flat surface.  Adjust-ability with the mount is enough, 180 deg rotation.  Wire very flexible and long enough to make connections for extension to junction box.Update:  Purchased a 2-pack and am happy with the light output.  Offset rear for slight side lighting.Previously single unit installed is working like it was when new.  No leaking at all and it is exposed directly to the elements.Paint surface suffering - gloss black is now a flat/matte black from UV rays and poor quality paint.  Not a complaint - and does not diminish usefulness of item (leaving at 5 stars).  No rust, no problems.  Great lights!

I bought these because I had bought some 1157 bay15d LED replacement bulbs for the turn signals on my motorcycle, and I was getting the hyper flash. These worked perfectly, and they were easy to install. I have included a photo of them next to a 9v battery so anyone interested can get an idea of their size.

I purchased this for a family member and he Installed it the day after we received it.  The amount of light is incredible.  We live in "the sticks" and it is very dark after sunset.  This was purchased for an electric golf cart that had NO lights.  It's easy to mount, wiring was easy, etc.  Heed the warning as there are fake Auxbeam lights available.  Buy this one if you need a small light bar but want ALOT of LIGHT!!  Shipper/vendor is great, no issues!!I recently purchased another one for my zero-turn mower.  Works great!!First photo is of it on the mower.  Second photo is of our pet when she saw how good it worked.
We want more!!

Spent hours reviewing the best possible cover for my cbr250. Even though this was the most expensive, the positive reviews couldn't be ignored. Unfortunately, 3 weeks into it I am less than pleased.Living in the Pacific Northwest means wet weather. Upon arrival, the packaging suggested to spray a "scotch guard" substance for added moisture barrier to their already 'waterproof ' cover; I sprayed 4 coats to make sure! The first week, this cover was worth every last cent! Even through its first rain storm, my bike stayed dry!  However, after the first week, I noticed some moisture on the seat and fuel tank of my bike when I would remove the cover. It has only gotten worse. It hasn't been through another rain, but just the dew from the crisp evenings is soaking right through!! Not only is the bike getting wet, but the interior of the cover is soaking wet as well, and certain parts of the cover take a long time to fully air dry. For the cost, I'm really disappointed. I attached two pictures of what the inside of the cover and outside of my bike look like after a morning of dew.Quality seems good in regards to thickness of material. Good, solid elastic band. Has been through a handful of high-gust wind storms with no parachute effect....but it will not keep your bike dry.  3 stars.

The quality and appearance of the bed rug is outstanding. The reason for  only four stars is that the Matt is actually about 2 inches too short.  They really should make it longer so that it fits the way it should, even better would be if they made it so that it was one continuous part from the bed and tailgate unit. The pictures below show the shortage. What you don't see is that I cheated a little and split the gap with the front so it wasn't as noticeable at the end.

I purchased this to connect my Rigid E 20" bar to, I purchased this switch because I could mount it in my truck without drilling in to any of the plastic. It attaches to your desired surface using double sided tape. It works well as a switch and it seems to stick on to a textured plastic surface good so far. When the switch is pressed in the light does not turn on until you release the button after the click and is turned off when you press the button before it clicks. This allows you to flash your light very easily. A green light is displayed when the switch is in the on position.Now the downsides:Less than a day after installing this switch the green indicator light intermittently worked and then completely stopped working later in the day. This is unacceptable after paying almost $30 for the switch. The switch works for now but I am unsure of how long it will last after the indicator light immediately went out. Clearly, quality control is not very great for these switches from Rigid despite the high price. I would try a different switch before buying this one.

Filter looked good but was not a direct replacement for my Kubota filter. It was about 1/4 longer and made it impossible to latch the cover on without bending the clamps. Once the clamps are bent, if an original filter is used it could cause a poor seal allowing dirt to bypass the filter and reducing engine life. Not cool. Ref 6C060-99410.

I waited and the day has came. This is the first time I left the boat and trailer on the street because I have major winter work done on the yard. I came out this morning to find that someone had tried to steal it. They tried to hammer the lock off but it did very little damage as you can see in the photo. Just barely scraped the paint. It's made of super heavy duty material and I don't see any hammer can break it. I am glad I decided to go with this lock. I would buy and recommend this product over and over again. Please look no farther and get this if you are looking for something that actually work.Update:I installed a set of Trimax wheel chock lock along with this lock. I can now leave it where ever I want and feel totally safe. It will take a lot of banging and sawing if they ever want to take it.Thank you for this great product!

Bright and true white in color. The fans are a bit loud but not enough to annoy you while driving. I actually kind of like the sound. And absolutely no warm up time, these lights are ready when you need them. Only thing is the light is not concentrated and is spread all around. Maybe better with projector headlights than regular but it's ok as long as you can see the road clearly. I also drilled wholes in the caps for the fans to breathe. (Shown in pictures) otherwise install is clean and simple.

Kit seems well made with only a few minor issues,1) the provided switch is incredibly large and bulky feels cheaply made.2)the length between the 2 plugs for the lights is way to short, had to add 18 of my own wiring to make it work between the fog lights.Word to the wise buy a Hella switch or something similar thats well made.

Power Stop K2009 Front Ceramic Brake Pad and Rotor kit is a great all in one brake replacement kit. Fit perfectly on my 04 Avalanche Z71 and look great to boot. The kit came with everything needed to properly replace and install your front brake pads and rotors. I am an ex-mechanic that was ASE certified in brakes. The rotors were even labeled so that you knew where to put them. I took my time to clean and lube the wheel hubs as well as the brake caliper bracket to make sure everything that is suppose to move does so and to prevent rust jacking. The brake pad kit included the ceramic carbon fiber pads with shims installed, new caliper slide brackets, new rubber bellow boots and bushings for the caliper slide. My only complaint about the kit is that the brake grease packet was broken open inside the box. Luckily the brake pads were covered in plastic which prevented them from becoming contaminated by the grease. But there were some holes in that plastic. I followed the break in procedure using my churches parking lot. The very first brake application was a little rough, but everything has been smooth ever since. They are an improvement over my worn out brakes. Hopefully they will help prevent brake fade while towing my camper. I look forward to seeing how well they hold up and work after getting several thousand miles on them. I will update my review if something changes that I feel needs to be addressed.

The scuff pad provided was so small! It lasted a whopping 1ftx6ft section. I then just switched to light sandpaper I had leftover from a previous project. Otherwise, with a proper prep job, it rolled on really nice. I picked this over the Dupli Color liner and I'm confident from the results

Both my vehicles are light colored, white and silver respectively. And yea yea guys, I'm aware that they make white light for these colors. I prefer the wet look of blacklight vs the bright look of white light. I was not disappointed with the results on my white paint. Makes it pop just that much more. I haven't done it on my silver yet but I'm sure it'll be even better on there. One point to note is that I am not using this as in all in one. I am simply using this as a polish for the gloss and shine. I have topped it off with collinite 845. People have complained about the durability but I'm not using it as my LSP so I don't really care about that. It is extremely easy to work, both application by DA or hand and buffing off are a breeze, no elbow grease needed whatsoever. Oh and it smells great too. I prepped with a dish soap wash, fallout remover, clay and IPA wipe down. Proper prep, blacklight and an LSP of your choice. You won't be disappointed. I won't be testing the durability of this product, however its so easy to use that I have no problem reapplying it 2-3 times a year.

I used this to tint the dome light in my 2001 Silverado. After installing a very bright LED bulb I found at night it killed my night vision and made it hard to see if I got something out of the truck and then went off. It took a total of 4 layers to achieve a nice red tint, and many people are complaining about it being pinkish. One or two layers will produce a pink tint so make sure you apply an extra layer. Overall worked well for my purpose and I still have plenty left for whatever project I pick next!

These are the best replacements you will buy.The OEM lights are junk. The seals fail and the fill with water, eventually shorting your bulbs out.I've had these for lights for three years now without a problem. One of the easiest self installs you can do, without extra wiring to do for the LED's. Just plug it in!

I bought these because I could not comfortably reach my levers. The install was a piece of cake, it literally took my 15 minutes max and I have never done one of these installs before. If having trouble, YouTube has plenty of helpful videos. The fact that they are adjustable and feel like a pretty good material is a great plus on stock levers. I don't know how the super expensive levers like ASV work but these do the job just fine. They completely change the look of the bike and give it just that little bit of personality.

Its a $20 cover, so I didn't go in expecting much. Its a thin cover, but all I wanted it for was over the winter storage in a garage. And it looks like it will fit the bill just fine! Test fitted on my Honda Metro, and a little baggy, but should do well. There are eye holes to tighten up if I wanted to, but I doubt there will be a need for me.Not too much to say about it, its a cover, thin fabric. Its priced well. Fits. I only docked one star just because it didn't blow me away, but again, perfect for what I wanted, wish it was a bit thicker, but then it wouldn't be a $20 cover anymore.EDIT: I thought about it, and wanted to give it back the missing star. It is only a $20 cover, how thick should I expect it to be. Bumped to 5 stars, I'll update if after the winter something is wrong with the scooter, but I doubt it.

I've had mine for a few months now on my 2006 1200C Sportster and no problems. I did not however use the pigtail that was provided I used a HD factory pigtail. I had seen a video of someone installing this product, and they had said there was some kind of issue with it that was the cause of all the short circuit problems. My only complaint is the plastic housing. I knew it was going to be plastic but it could have been thicker. I'm not real concerned about size since I have a batwing fairing on my bike. I am happy with it and would definitely recommend it to others.

FORD 1999 F350 Dually 4X4 7.3L Diesel. Purchased both front replacement units.  Upon install I noticed that the clearance between the caliper slot and the rotor was different inboard and out board, did not make too much of it until I started to drive. I noticed wear in the outboard side of the rotors consistent with rubbing against the caliper. Upon measuring all components back to the dust shield , I realized that id the dust shield was out then the fit would be perfect . The rotors would seat dead center if the shield was not there. I was not going to remove the dust shield so I found two Grade 8 washers 5/8 center hole and full coverage diameter of the sitting for the caliper and Vuala!! I gained the space taken by the dust shield and no more rubbing of the rotors with the calipers and it is dead center allowing for the common "play" when turning the vehicle.  Heavy duty bearings, came with everything I needed... plug and play.

Got the 4 inch spot, 6 LED version of this light - description states 1800lm output, but after hooking up my multimeter to the leads, it shows an amperage draw of 0.822 amps at 12.6V which means it uses about 10.35watts. That comes out to be a maximum of 1.725 watts per LED (certainly less after the the internal power supply/voltage conversion losses). The description states OSRAM LEDs, so I went to the Osram's website and lookup product specifications for their LED modules, their most efficient LED gives about 154 lumen per watt. So... 154 lumens x 1.725 watts x 6 lights = slight less than 1600 lumens, and this is being way generous with no power supply loss and assuming Auxbeam used the priciest and most effecient OSRAM LEDs to build the product.If my math is wrong or I missed something, someone please correct me and I'll be happy to update this review.With all this being said, the narrow spot lamp is BRIGHT, even if it doesn't seem to output match according to spec.

When I decided to buy these, I vowed to myself that I would not be like the thousands of rude people who install them, knowing nothing about optics, and blind everyone in front of them or coming the opposite direction.  It took three attempts to get the orientation correct on my 2010 Dodge RAM 1500 4x4.  The first attempt had the LED arrays horizontal (lights on top and bottom), which caused the optics in my truck to spray the light way up high, and would have definitely blinded other drivers.  The final arrangement that worked for me was to set them at a 45-degree angle as shown in the photos.  And not the same, but "mirrored".  This produced a nice, flat beam that evenly illuminates the roadway.  They seem to be a very well made product, nice packaging, and fairly decent documentation.  The reason I am only giving 4 stars is because the high-beam function isn't that much brighter than the low-beams.  If you install these, PLEASE keep trying until you get them right and don't blind other drivers because of apathy.  Thanks!

I know this is for a Chevy, but I used it on my Jeep Comanche. The tailgate handle assembly for my truck is not reproduced and can be very costly used, but this matches in size and required minimal modification to the tailgate to fit. I am extremely satisfied with the fit and function in my off-application. Installation did require drilling, and a little grinding on the backside of the tailgate cutout, but that's all. 20 minute job. I know the handle rots out on Comanches a lot and if this review helps one owner, that's good for me. See my product photo if you want to do it yourself.

Purchased to cover the worn out steering wheel in a 2011 Honda Fit with under 50k miles. Thought about getting a Honda one, but they're over $50 compared to this for under $10! One difference is that there are not little cutouts for the three steering wheel posts. And you cannot trim it due to the stitch line. But the price and quality of materials makes up for it. I'm adding my installed pic and in my opinion, the lack of cutouts is no big deal at all.Looks and feels great! Installation went smoothly and online videos definitely helped. Wish it was made in the USA but shipping from China took just over a week. Seems like a cool little present too if you spend the time and do it for someone.I had plenty of thread and the install process is very forgiving. For example if you thread into the wrong loop in the stitching, it's very easy to reverse it back and try again.

Got this for a 2006 Nissan Titan SE 4x4 as well as the the VBC(<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Genuine-Nissan-27151-ZT00A-Heater-Resistor/dp/B00BFE4OPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Genuine Nissan 27151-ZT00A Heater Resistor</a>). My blower quit working one day and through some research I found these two parts to be the culprit. Simple enough job to do yourself and everything is working great after one day. The reason for 4 stars is that it was shipped to me damaged(disappointing). The shipping box was fine, but when I opened it up I immediately noticed one of the plastic mounting holes was damaged(see picture). Fortunate for Amazon, I had some Loctite Super Glue to fix it and all is well again for now.

I've been advised to only use MANN or MAHLE oil filters if going aftermarket (vs. buying BMW-branded ones at the dealer).  I have used both brands with equal success in my 2001 E46 (3-Series) and 2002 E53 (X5) over the course of 16-17 years.But something odd happened my last oil change.  Oil was leaking out of the oil filter cap like water.  Even after a 2 minute drive to the grocery store, I see oil dripping from the bottom of the car, about 1 drop per second!  Left a huge puddle within seconds!  So I inspected and found that oil was leaking from the oil filter cap!  I thought maybe I didn't tighten it enough, so I tightened it and test drove.  Same thing!  So I removed the cap and filter and inspected to see make sure the gasket was on correctly and not torn or something.  Visually it looked OK.  So I put it back.  Still keeps leaking!  So I theorized that maybe the gasket was too thin (smaller diameter)?  I threw away the previous one, so I couldn't compare, but then I realized I had an extra set of Mahle filter (exact same brand and model, but I ordered this one last year).What do you know?  Looking at the gasket side by side, the one from last year is THICKER (bigger diameter)!  So I swapped the gaskets and put everything back and not a single drop of oil leaking from the cap now.  What happened???  Seeing the other 1-Star reviews here, they all have the same problem with the gasket being too thin and letting oil leak past the cap!  Someone at Mahle messed up or they switched gasket suppliers.  They need to fix this problem ASAP.Like I said, the one I ordered last year vs. the one I ordered a few weeks ago have DIFFERENT size gaskets.  I have never had this issue with Mahle filters on my BMWs until just now.  if someone at Mahle is reading this, please inspect and get to the bottom of why your gaskets are now thinner and not fitting any more-- fire your gasket supplier and get back to the old one!Until this issue is fixed, my 1-Star review stands so that other Amazon customers can be warned.  I suggest going with MANN filters for now until this is fixed.

I really hated the yellow light the halogen bulbs put out when the lights were on. I have no clue why the manufacturer would put HID bulbs in the headlights and then use the nasty colored, hot, and less durable bulbs in the fog light locations. I assume it is because they are cheaper to use.These bulbs are the first LED bulb I have tried in an application that is supposed to light the ground up in front of the car and they do an admirable job. I have read that many of these style bulbs do not project light out very well. Not so in the case of these bulbs. When I am driving down a dark road and I turn these lights on, they are very apparently on. They do help light the road in just about the same way the halogen bulbs did, but they do it in a bright 6000K color which I think is easier to see while driving.Installing these bulbs was exactly the same process as installing the OEM bulb. So if you can replace the OEM bulbs, then you can do these. I have noticed many of the LED bulbs on the market have a ballast like the HID. These do not. They are super simple.I really like the bulbs. They work well. The light is bright. Buy them.If you found my review helpful, prevented aliens from abducting you or was funny, then I would appreciate that you click the Yes button to let me know that I am providing useful information to you and others.

This was the silver lining of a week where everything went wrong. Before it arrived I expected a cheap plastic shiny finish with imperfections that I would have to paint over. This was not the case. The grille has a flat black matte finish that looks professional. The installation was easy after looking up a couple of videos on how to remove the front bumper. When the screw goes into the hole it's a bit scary because the post isn't very thick and you can see through the plastic. I did not need to drill any holes. The original screws worked fine. I uploaded two pictures to show the final product.

Leaves black ink stains on my palms. The stitching on one of the gloves is starting to wear out where the padding is located as well as the pad, seems like a hole might show up soon maybe this is a result of my end mirrors and me rubbing against them.  They're nice when it's really hot out. I think they should be priced at 30 dollars. Buy QUALITY leathers!Update aug 3 2017**The stiching came apart.**

I did noticed some increased in gas mileage on my digital display along with the Pedal Commander which was about 335-350mpg compared with the Toyota stock 292 average on regular (87octane) fill-up.  This has been consistent after 2 months of driving including a 7K miles round trip cross-country road trip.  The initial install showed a 421mi after fill-up.Correction for the above "335-350mpg".  What I wanted to state was after fill-ups with the "Innovative & Pedal Commander" the digital display on my 2015 Tundra Crewmax is 335-350 until empty.  Apologies if anyone misunderstood, I should have proof-read my post before hand.  :)

09 Mercury Mariner HybridThis car is unfortunately not covered by the recall warranty even though its the same part. Thankfully this is available to save me all that $$$.Replaced throttle body and o-ring in minutes, also cleaned the mass air flow sensor with CFC.Being hybrid means the relearning process isn't needed like with a gas engine. Well, I couldn't find anything when I googled. If Im wrong please let me know.

These are nice looking heavy duty mats I saw at a local parts store and almost bought.  I waited and got them cheaper on Amazon.  I have the front and rear mats in a 2015 Ford F250 Supercrew and they look great.  The driver mat has a pin to keep it in place.  I wouldn't call them "exact fit", but there was NO WAY I was spending $100 + for those type.  I'm picky and these fit pretty well. They can be trimmed if necessary, which I did on the passenger side.

I replaced bad original starter clutch from my 2009 Buell XB12Scg by this All Balls HD# 31663-90 unit and it works really well. Original starter from Buell has gasket on shaft, this clutch does not have gasket, but it does not leak anyway. Works with no issues already 7000 miles. 5 stars.

 Brief I've been riding a motorcycle for the past 5 years now, be it for general commuting or going out for rides with my close friends, though there has always been one real big issue when riding... communication.My friends and I have tried a budget radio set before, but not only did that rely on pressing a button every time you wanted to talk, which was really impractical I must add, it also lacked in audio quality and picked up other peoples signals.Another failed attempt was when my friend was a pillion, we used our smartphones with an in-line mic & some earphones, we then called each other before setting off.  Unfortunately not only was the audio quality poor, the lack of reception caused constant drop-outs... We gave up in the end.However with the Sena 20S, everything is connected via Bluetooth, so they'll be no interference with other devices as they need to be paired together to connect.  The connection is also consistently strong from A to B.Undoubtedly this is a pretty expensive package, however I can assure you the quality of this product is absolutely top-notch and definitely reflects in the price-tag, never mind all the features this product has to offer. What's In The Box Because this is a Dual pack, double EVERYTHING below:Headset (main unit)* | Helmet Clamp (static boom mic & speakers already connected) | Wired Boom Mic | Wired Mic | Wind Shields for Microphones | USB Cable (for charging & updating firmware) | Car Charger | 2.5 - 3.5mm Stereo Audio Cable | Adhesive Mounting Adaptor | Rubber Pads | Velcro Pads | Speaker Pads | Allen Key.I really like the design of the headset, it's small, slimline and is very lightweight.  It fits well and looks good when mounted onto a helmet. Product Features Bluetooth 4.0 | 13 Hour Talk Time & 10 Day Stand-by Time | Up to 1.2 Mile Intercom Range | Group / Multi-way Intercom that can connect up to 8 people! | HD Quality Audio | Audio Multitasking | Voice Commands | Music Sharing | NFC (Quick pairing with compatible devices) | Bluetooth Audio Recording: (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sena-GP10-01-GoPro-Bluetooth-Pack/dp/B00I03984S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sena (GP10-01) GoPro Bluetooth Pack</a>) | Universal Intercom | FM Radio Tuner | Firmware Upgradable | App Available.- Headset ports: Micro-USB for charging & firmware upgrade.- Helmet clamp ports: Headphone port so you can use your own* and an AUX port which allows you to plug in an MP3 player for example.* When you plug in your own headphones, they will have priority over the speakers.  You can remove the speakers if you so wanted to. Helmet Attachment Set-Up This was a very easy and quick process, should take no more than 5 minutes:1) Take-out the left side cheek pads of your helmet (this makes the installation much easier).2) Get the helmet clamp and use the Allen key to loosen the bolts on the clamp, this will allow you to widen the clamp and slip it on to the side of your helmet.3) Re-insert the cheek pads.4) Place the speakers into the helmet into an appropriate spot.  All helmets are different so you can place them underneath the cheek pads, inside an ear-piece pocket (not all helmets have), or in a crevasse so the speakers won't dig into your ears.Out of the three helmets, all three helmets had space for the speakers to be placed.5) Click the headset onto the clamp.If your helmet is unsuitable for the clamp alone, there is an adhesive mount included which can be used, however I've tried mounting the clamp on three different helmets and none requires the adhesive mount. Intercom & Smartphone Set-Up - Intercom via the headsets:Very, very simple to set-up and there are two ways to pair them:1) Turn on both headsets and shake them until both have green flashing LED's, then press the centre circular button (also known as the jog button) on either one of the headsets.2) Turn on both headsets and hold both job buttons for 6 seconds.Then to start a connection between the two, on one of the headsets tap the jog button.Apparently you can have up to an eight-way conversation, however I couldn't test this as I only have two headsets.The quality you get from both headsets is absolutely superb.- Smartphones / Bluetooth devices:The easiest and quickest way is to use NFC if your mobile has this feature.  Simply place your devices NFC hotspot onto the back of the headset, within seconds the two should be paired.Alternatively hold the headsets phone button for 5 seconds, then search for "Sena 20S" on your smartphone.  If it asks for a pin, type in "0000".With the 20S being connected to your smartphone, you can answer/make calls or listen to audio etc... Adjusting some of the settings is best done through the smartphone app. Product Usability The 20S is actually pretty simple to use and navigate around, be it by pressing the buttons or tapping the headset to activate the voice command mode.  What takes time is to get used to knowing where the headset is on your helmet and being able to locate the buttons.Obviously the thicker the gloves, the harder it is to feel what you're touching.  That said, after a bit of practice I've been able to press the buttons fine with winter gloves on.  There are quite a few commands to remember, so do give the manual a good read.The voice command mode is a decent feature to have, all you have to do is tap the headset a few times to activate it, then you can call out a command such as "speed dial 1" or "music" etc... The commands aren't very specific, so you couldn't say "play King of Leon", you would need to select a song and pause it so when you activate it, it will select the music from where you last left off.  It's no Siri from Apple's iOS, but it's still good enough to use.One feature I really liked was how easy it is to see how much battery is left.  When you turn on the headset, there will be a series of red flashes, the more flashes there are the more battery is left:  2 Flashes = 0-30% | 3 Flashes = 30-70% | 4 Flashes = 70-100%. Sound Quality & Wireless Range I've been getting nothing but compliments from people who are on the receiving end of a phone call or intercom, as long as you place the microphone in an appropriate place (Shielded away from the wind), the quality is crystal clear.  In fact I had speed dialed my friend and he had no idea I was outside riding my motorcycle.The speakers are also very good quality, obviously if you're on the receiving end of a phone call, the quality you're going to get will depend on the other persons microphone or phone.  If you're communication with another Sena headset through the intercom feature, then you'll be amazed at how good the sound is (providing they have placed the microphone in the right place).If you're listening to music, don't expect it to be on par with some Beats headphones, however the sound is well above satisfactory. #TIP: When listening to music, bump up the volume to the max on your smartphone/device before adjusting it on the headset.  Don't go overkill on loud volume, taking away all sound from your surroundings removes a lot of your road senses, this can make riding dangerous.Wireless range is pretty impressive, especially as this is a Bluetooth headset.  Though there are factors which can effect the range quality:1) Open space: This is where the range is at it's best, me and my friend at one point where really far apart, to the point we could barely see each other, yet could still communicate.2) Objects in the way (e.g. buildings and trees): There were a few times when the headset had ceased to communicate with the other one; one was when we were a decent distance apart and I was coming into a bend, there were a lot of trees blocking the direct path to us both, this caused the headsets to stop communicating.  Another example was when my friend rode around the other side of a bunch of houses, if they weren't there I have no doubt in the headsets connecting, but unfortunately disconnected.Though a good thing about this headset is if it disconnects due to lack of range, the headsets will reconnect when they come back in range of each other. Smartphone App The 'Sena Utility' App is available on both Apple's 'iTunes' & Android's 'Play Store'.It's not a perfect app, in fact it would do with a few touch-ups to make the app look cleaner looking.  Nevertheless it does offer a variety of options to toggle:1) My Device: View the connected devices model number, current firmware and whether it's up to date, plus a quick user guide which is extremely useful.2) Group Intercom: Organise different group intercom lists.3) Pairing List: View paired devices.4) Settings:- Basic Settings: VOX Phone, Sidetone, Audio Multi tasking & Intercom-audio Overall Sensitivity.- Speed Dial: Three pre-sets.*- FM Radio: Set-Up radio pre-sets.* It would have been nice to see a minimum of 5 pre-sets and an ability to name each one would be nice too. FM Radio If there's one area this product lacks in quality, it would have to be the FM radio feature.  I'm not exactly a fan of listening to the radio, however there are a tonne of people who are.When using the FM Radio, you can manually skip through the different frequencies, start an automatic scan or use the app which will allow you to pre-set up to 10 different frequency bands of your choice.  If you're riding, manually or automatically scanning isn't the best idea as it involves too much time with your hands pressing buttons.Unfortunately when testing this feature out it didn't seem to matter what I did, the signal was extremely poor.  After looking on forums some people have had no problems, whilst a lot of others have had the same. Final Opinion The 20S amazed me the first time I used it, yet I seem to love it more and more every time I use it.I've been using this product every day since getting it and I honestly couldn't imagine myself riding without it. Pros: Long battery life (13 hours talk time!). Decent range for a Bluetooth intercom. Solid intercom connection. Multi-intercom connections. Very high quality mic & sound. Easy to use/set-up & comfortable to use. Good amount of accessories included. Whole load of features. 2 Year Warranty. Cons: App needs a bit of sprucing up. Battery is irreplaceable. FM radio isn't the best right now, hopefully it can be patched up in future firmware. For the price, it would have been nice if they had included a little carry case.There's a lot to love and not a lot to hate. If I hadn't been given this to review, but did have the opportunity to try it beforehand, I would have bought this in a heartbeat!  Would highly recommend. Note: I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review..:**:.:**:.:**:.:**:.:**:.:**:.:**:.:**:.:**:. UPDATE - SEPTEMBER 2014 The latest firmware for the 20S is version 1.2.  Unfortunately there hasn't been an improved performance with the FM radio, however there have been other customers who have reported on the official forum that they've got in contact with customer support, apparently they've had their main units replaced with new ones which has solved the issue.So if the FM radio is a feature you really want to use and yours doesn't work, I'd recommend getting in contact with Sena directly. HOW TO UPDATE THE HEADSET To update your 20S, go to their official website and click on the 'Support' tab and then the 'Software' option.You'll then need to register your product if you haven't already.  Once registered, log in and download the 'Sena Device Manager' for the appropriate OS you're using, be it for Mac or Windows.Once the software has been installed, load it up and make sure your 20S is off before connecting it to your computer via a micro-USB lead.#NOTE: Although on 'Step 3' it states "Power on your Sena product", there is also another sentence beneath stating: "* If you use the 20S, power off the device and connect it with the USB cable".Then click "NEXT" and follow the steps. Since I've had this product, I've been using it on every single ride out.  Although my use may vary from others, if you have a question I may just be able to help, so please leave a comment and I'll do my best! :)

Looks heavy duty. Looks like it will do the job with no problem and will last a life time. Here is utube video of it.[...] I used it on a 3/4 ton suburban 4x4 and it worked great. I also used it to hold the door to change door hinge pins. It worked great for that. I was able to change the pins by myself.

If I could give The Stopshop 6 stars I would! Not only was the brake line and fittings sent super fast the owner sent an e-mail right after sending confirming and included his phone number just in case what I ordered wasn't correct to call him! So on to the product...I have a 1995 jeep wrangler and it needed all of the hard line brake line to be replaced. I went with 25' of 3/16 copper nickel brake line and even with one small mistake in measuring on the right-rear I still had about two feet left over. This tubing is a perfect fit for the jeep and while I replacing the hardline I ran SS lines down to all four wheels. I'm including a picture ......No more Rusting in the Midwest with Nickel Copper ....Woohoo!!!

Awesome plug in play harness. This could not have been easier to install. Simply removed the two screws on the driver's side rear lights unplugged the harness and plugged this in. Ran it down to the hitch and done. Worked on my 2015 Wrangler. Works great. I highly recommend!

Fit my 2011 KLR650 great! Oh, when you try to take the old one off and it won't come off, don't do what I did: see the screwholes and decide the engine is stronger than sprocket's attachment to the shaft. What will happen is you'll drive the screws through the output shaft seal, digging it deep in there. Have fun getting it out! I did! Oh boy, two days of fun. Don't do that. Put a couple screws into the sprocket holes, slide a knife in between them, keep screwing in slowly, pulling out the sprocket. Done.Oh and when you're all done, make sure you throw more tools than before into the rightside box. When you get off it to close the gate.. It'll fall and break a mirror. Two days of work for what should've been an hour. Oh man.

I had high hopes for this, even when I saw the label "Made in China". This is Bestop's value range, so Pavement Ends brand must have cut costs somewhere.I bought it for a CJ7 with a YJ tub and family cage. It shoudk have fitted fine with the CJ full doors as well.The materiai is premium, like my other Bestop products and should give years of use but the whole top is 2" - 3" too narrow, and I don't have padding on the roll bar. There is no warning that if you have full size doors, this material will not stretch out to the doors and there will be a gap.The rear straps are on wrong, This will not tighten down on to the rear seat belt mounting as advertised as the straps in the middle are too far away. It looked awful at the back when fitted as the middle straps pulled it down..I contacted Bestop and they identified my family roll cage may not be original and suggested a few solutions.In the end I bought some 9" rubber trap straps and fitted them from the rear seat belt mounting to the buckle for the rear straps. This pulled the rear taught. The straps were then taken horizontally to the roll bar and wrapped round but I may as well have cut them off.The gap to the doors will have to be filled with the metal hoop from the old soft to and some foam rubber when wrapping the roll bar. This is the most disappointing aspect, the narrowness of the material.Overall it will keep the sun off but when it rains you will get wet in the front, even with full size doors.

I installed 4 doors along with the mirrors made by the same manufacturer (the ones designed to install directly on the pre-drilled metal bracket located inside the soft doors). I figured I had to write this review due to the mixed reviews out there that nearly scared me away from these doors.Quality: Outstanding !!!I am so impressed with the quality of the materials & workmanship !!! These doors are really made well & Im sure they will hold-up for a long time. Heavy cloth, sturdy steel frame construction, plus the vinyl windows, zippers, & the hook & loop are top quality !!!Installation:Installation was a SNAP!!! I studied the instructions carefully & then used a totally different (much easier) approach which helps a great deal in making the alignment easier. I simply: 1) put the lower door on the hinges right out of the box; 2) loosened the hinge adjustment bracket to make positioning the latch easier; 3) installed the latches after positioning them exactly where I wanted them & latching them to the vehicle to hold them in position (because the hinge adjustment bracket was loose allowing me to do so) & tightening the screws for the latches all the way; 4) entered the Jeep from the other side & tightened the hinge bracket in place; 5) add the top piece, made some minor adjustments & DONE !!! Repeat X4. This was so quick & easy.Pulling Away Issue & Simple Correction:As many reviewers have indicated, I think Ill be tweaking the adjustment as I use these a while to get the doors tuned-in exactly the way I want them. However, I wanted to addressed the issue of the doors pulling away at the top when traveling at higher speeds, which some have experienced. Three of my doors did NOT do this & one pulled away maybe an inch - I will continue to work on the bending to see if I can correct this. However, until I can get this one door just right a VERY simple fix that works for ALL doors is the two sided black hook & loop tape (about a half inch wide) that comes on a 12 foot roll for taming wiring. You can get a 12 foot roll anywhere, & its more than enough for all four doors.I simply loosened the hook & loop on the top of the door that holds the cloth to the very top metal bar. Then I wrapped a length of the hook & loop tape (roll) around the top metal bar & slid the length to the front corner of the door where the pulling actually starts. Then I simply fastened it to itself on the door end & attached the other end to the exposed of hook & loop existing on my grab handles. Worked like a charm.For front doors, simply run the other end of the hook & loop tape over to the relatively heavy duty sun visor metal arm. This arm is more than sturdy enough to withstand the pressure of the door pulling out. It really doesnt take anything too sturdy to counter the pulling pressure.  The reason for this is, if you keep the door top in the correct tucked in position there really is very little pulling pressure on it.  The pressure increases exponentially as the door top is pulled further out in the wind.For rear doors just attach the length to the existing grab handle hook & loop or around the roll bar  problem solved ! When not in use leave one end looped around the top metal bar of the door  just find one of the many existing exposed hook & loop locations on the door & stick the length to it for temporary out of the way storage. This solution was very cheap, is not even noticeable, & allows you to drive any speed you want without the doors pulling away at the top ! Takes only 2 seconds to undo or redo the length of hook & loop tape each trip. (Also, you really only have to do this when its raining if you want.)Bottom Line:These doors are great  very well made. If you can follow my method of installation I think it will make life easier for you. If you are hesitating to make this purchase because of the potential the doors will pull away at the top (I know I was VERY worried about it)  just buy a 12 foot roll of (approx. half inch) black hook & loop tape used to tie cables / wires.Theres no question about the advantage of running these doors in the warmer weather to facilitate fast & easy door-less driving. They really do remove in a couple seconds for each door. They store easily in the back of the Jeep.One more thing I forgot to mention . . . I do see some daylight at the bottom of the door  however, Im not at all concerned about it. I haven't driven in the rain yet, but Im expecting very minimal rain to enter through the bottom gap. I also think when sitting in a driveway during even wind-blown rain that this gap will not be an issue.See pics of my JKU for cloth doors on & doors off, plus just door tops off !!!  (Doors off completely pic does not show latest fender modifications.)

Jeep Commander 2006 thru 2010.. mount brackets included will not fit our Commander wide 5" Aero crossbars.. MY SOLUTION: the YAKIMA Load Warrior brackets will fit. In Amazon the Yakima Load Warrior bracket is named YAKIMA HARDWARE BAG. Must order 4 to complete the set of mounts to install our cargo box to our Jeep Commanders OEM crossbars. Amazon Cost is $20 a bracket. With the extra $80 added to cost of our cargo box, we still save at least a $100 over the Yakima load warrior. A slight modification is needed with the rubber pad that will allow it to slip into the 2 box bars it attaches to. I am so happy that I have quality Yakima brackets to safely secure our spacious 64" long heavy duty cargo box.

I replaced my budget lift with the Teraflex to gain articulation as 2DR JK does not have the wheel base of JKU to compensate. Budget lift went into our 2015 JKU. I am super happy with Teraflex great quality and I got the articulation I was wanting and the Wife likes the budget lift in her JKU. Teraflex won't let you down they make a solid product with good instructions. 4 of us complete the lift removal and install on both Jeeps in under 4 hours!

Amazing for restoring my paint job. The kit gave me good results. Waxed on the left side and the right side is not-waxed. This Toyota truck had not been washed for 3 years and sat out in the sun continually for even more years. You be the judge from the pictures. My paint job was completely faded and no amount of washing helped it's luster, till now I used a good amount of elbow grease but not bad. I would buy again. I will get another use from this kit as advertised 2 applications in one kit...I am happy!!

This steering stabilizer DOES NOT FIT.  The rubber bushings on the shock side are far too wide for the mounting bracket.  It absolutely will not fit, even with force.  Returning.

The cover seems tough and fits really well, I like it. The only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is that on the underside is some clear tape-like sealant on the seams that is beginning to peel off. Im not sure if its just an extra measure to keep it watertight at the seams or not, but its still holding back the rain.

As others have stated, this kit is different from the picture. But, what I received was exactly what I wanted (the grease canister from Dualco). I you this Dualco grease canister to grease my air tools and it works great. I have also used the pictured in description screw on bottle pump and it always leaks/strips out plastic treads/and let's in air while pumping.Amazon, can you please correct your product picture as it is not correct?I do highly recommend the Dualco pump kit,CPS

Holds 2 of my 50 pound e-bikes well even at 80 mph. It says it won't fit a Subaru Crosstrek but it does. The mounting point angles match. The loud noise it generates in 50 mph+ is more like a wind howl and low frequency hum. Foam tubing and wrapping it with rubber ties cuts off the noise down from loud to soft. But adds more labor when installing/removing accessories. I had a 1/2" x 4 " black painted wood zip tied at the back of the rectangular tubes to tackle the noise problem. It seemed to have gained some of the lost MPG so I just kept it on.

These have been some comments/questions about if this works with a Suburban as a tow vehicle. I think the answer is soft of, depending on your setup.Well, I hitched up the Suburban and found that with my one bike/platform rack setup it will work if I put the bike on carefully and don't do an extremely tight turn. I have everything adjusted as far back towards the trailer as possible.I have to have the TV and trailer straight to open the back lift door, and then I need to have the bike pedal at 6 oclock for it to clear.In turns the tires/wheel holders come close to the Suburban. At the closest points in these pictures the back bumper was about 3 off the propane tanks, so thats a pretty tight turn. I will have to be careful in extreme turns, but I think it will be OK. I did think about cutting it shorter, but that is clearly not an option.So this is a single bike setup and two bikes would not work with my TV. If you had a truck or a vehicle w/o a flat back  or at least one not as big as a Suburban  you would probably not have any problems using this.PS-One of the top holes on the cross bar is smaller than the other. It was very difficult to insert the pole end and hard to twist it (had to use a mallet). The other side was fine, so this is certainly a manufacturing flaw. As others have mentioned while installing it is not brain surgery, the instructions could be better. Thus the deductions in stars. Wish I could rate it 3.5.

My Triumph America sits at 95" with a 65" wheelbase and has no bags or accessories, and the Cruiser-sized cover fits it perfectly.  This is a heavier-duty fabrication than the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CoverMax-Deluxe/dp/B000WJ93O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CoverMax Deluxe</a>&nbsp;I'd been using the last couple years (which basically disintegrated in the sun).  While I've only had it a few months, it did a great job through the winter of keeping rain and snow off my baby.The dual vents do a smart job of keeping breathability while staying weather-resistant, but they don't vent as well as models with larger windows, so heavy wind (55mph gale gust - I live on the Chesapeake Bay) did blow her over like a sail, causing some scuffed chrome.  Keep it out of hurricane winds and you should be fine, though.  The only thing I don't like is the little clips on the bottom rather than a hole-and-strap mechanism like the CoverMax.The Cruiser size fits all the way down to the wheels on my bike.  While it has an admittedly wide handle and stance, I'm skeptical that this cover would actually take a bike all the way to a 105" like it claims (maybe a long, thin Victory?).  If you're over 100" or with saddlebags, I'd probably consider the touring size.

I bought this for a 2000 Isuzu Hombre (same as the Chevy S-10) after a recent rear-end collision left the old bumper a mess. Used bumpers were going to cost $125 or more, plus freight, in usable but far from perfect condition. I chose this one based on the reviews, and ordered the 97200 mounting kit with it.It's a good quality steel bumper, and I have no hesitation about installing a ball hitch on it for pulling a light trailer. The paint was flawless, and the shop that installed it after repairing the frame and bracket damage were completely positive about it. The hardware is all coated, rust-resistant stuff, and it even included the license plate light kit.I'm including a photo so owners of similar Hombre and S-10 pickups can see what it looks like. (Yes, my truck is no beauty queen, but it runs well enough.)

Completely Satisfied with the bumper, the quality of the bumper and the way it was packaged - all corners or edges were protected.  Looks great on the jeep and was extremely easy to install.  The hardest part was removing the stock bumper on my 2007.  Look forward to adding the winch and light bar next weekend.

They work just as stated.  I cannot verify the 800lm but they are very bright and in my backup camera it looks like daytime.  So far, easily worth the money.  I will update if they fail prematurely.  - using on a 2002 Camry as backup lights.

Installed in a 2012 Jeep Wrangler fog lights.  This is listed as a direct replacement for 2504.  It is not.  It is very close, but the internal tabs are different.  I attached a photo.  The new LED light (black) has a tab reversed (white is the factory light).  Simple fix was just to trim off the tab, and then the bulb fit perfectly and locked into place.  Nice, clean white light.  Light dispersion is acceptable.  I was a little disappointed at first and then I remembered that this is a fog light replacement, so light dispersion is supposed to be low, without a lot of distance.  Keeping it in context, it is a nice improvement, and would match LED headlights nicely.  Main beam dispersion is low as mentioned, with a soft glow extending higher (the reflector in the light housing controls dispersion).  All-in-all, great buy.

The belt held up great. Nothing wrong with the way the belt was made. Upset with the fact the Amazon says this fits my 04 4runner SR5 4.7l V8 gas. It fits and runs technically. But it fits loose and slipped the whole time I had it on. I added a picture to show the Auto tensioner pointer was to the right of the 3 lines. This is within the " replace belt" category.  I found and replaced it with Bando 6PK2235 and auto tensioner pointer between the far left and middle lines. This is within the "belt good" category. Both belts show up on Amazon as fitting my application. NOT HAPPY.

The grill is definitely a great addition to my jeep.  It looks a lot better.  It looks sporty.  So if you are getting tired of the look of your jeep and want a little change, put this grill on and it will definitely make a difference it the looks of your jeep.  My Jeep is burgundy and I ordered the black color.  Ibeleive it comes with other color.  I ordered the black color to show contrast with the burgundy and definitely add dimension and different look on my jeep.  The material is plastic and it is shiny.  I wish they have a matted color to match all my black plastic on my jeep but it is small enough so the shiny can really only be noticed from a short distance.  It comes with 7 grills.  The shape of the top and bottom is different, so you can tell which one is the bottom and which one is the top.  It has a tape around it so you can taped it to your grill.  So before peeling the tape, it is best to just place it and try it first to see if you have the right top and bottom side to avoid peeling the adhesive off again and reinstalling it the right way.  I don't know if the tape is heavy duty but make sure you pressed it hard to make sure the adhesive is touching the jeep surface.  As far as covering the radiator, I like that it has so many holes to still let the air and in /out and circulate.  It also prevents bugs for getting stuck and just too many bugs hitting and covering your radiator.  I don't see any effect on my driving so I can say right now that it does not affect your driving on negative or positive way.  It is all for looks for me at this point.I got this grill at a discounted price in exchange of honest review.  I love the grill.  Definitely gave a little flare and different look on my jeep.  Little changes like this makes a big difference on the look of the jeep.  Here are some before and after photo.  Hope this helps.

OK seriously, you need this tool.  Any shade tree mechanic worth their salt should have this tool.  It has professional level features jam packed into a small package. Easy to set up.  Plug into OBD port under the dash.  Link to phone or tablet via Bluetooth, and your ready.  I suggest a tablet since you can see the numbers and details more easily.  I particularly like to live function, since you can see the parameters in real time while sensors are responding.  For instance, I can sit in the passenger seat, and monitor the oxygen sensor values on the fly.  You can take a snap shot of the values for future reference. On my Dodge this tool was able to monitor and clear body control DTC's that had been their for years probably.  Cheap scan tools can't go that deep into the car's CAN modules. You are also able to see what emission monitors have passed, good to check before going to inspection. It even shows TSB's and recall information that apply to your car via Internet connection. Switching from one car to the next is just as easy.  Just move the Blue Driver plug. Excellent.

Tired of the junk being sold these days. Installed these on a 2016 Ram 1500 Crew Cab. Rears were fine, the fronts have a tab that is in the way of the window going up at the mirror. Most likely this is for support when the wind hits it. Put these in, let the windows up for a week thinking the plastic might 'mold' to the door window frame. Nope. Tried bending them out of the way, no dice. Window hits and the window lowers due to hitting the plastic and going past the safety threshold. Results may vary, but I will not recommend these and will likely take them off and replace them with something else.

I bought a pair of these 6 ply Kendas in September 2012.  I have used the 4X8 trailer twice.  The first was to pull 2 Motorcycles from central Illinois down to Birmingham, Alabama and back, 1340 miles.  Again, Just used the trailer to haul 1 motorcycle down to Kentucky and back, 700 miles.  its now May, 2013 these two little tires now have 2040 miles on them.  Plenty of tread left for the next pull.  Did I mention they spent the entire winter buried under the ice and snow.  No weather cracking, I didn't even have to air em up, they held perfect pressure.  Before I first installed em on the trailer I took em down and had them spin balanced.  I am nothing less than amazed w these tires.

Bolts on plugs in and works. If it wasn't so cheap it would not get 5 star. Fitment isn't perfect and it is a slightly different style than my factor 2008 mirrors but it does look good it works and so far it doesn't have any issues. In the pictures you can see the slight style difference in the arm. These have a bit of an indent that my factory mirrors do not have

Bought a pack of 4 red LED lights for my Mazda3.These lights work great and do exactly what I need them to do. Something to note, red light is not as bright as the super white LEDs. Red light is easier on the eyes at night, and this is why I bought them. So while the light output in the picture might not look the greatest, it lights up everything I need at night without being overly bright and distracting. Great to use red lights while looking at maps and other things at night while driving.

The lights look and work great.  I am only giving them 4 out of 5 stars because they should package the brackets separate from the screws and washers because if the box is shaking a lot it will cause some scratches or wear on the brackets.  A black sharpie will help hide any scratches if you don't feel like the hassle of returning for a new set.  Also in one set of lights I received a screw hole stripped out when attaching the bracket.  Customer service was non-existant so I had to return them and order a new set.

These spacers fit perfectly on my truck. Went on easy and I have a little extra sticking out the wheel wells. No vibration and the spacers look like they are a quality made product. Just a word of caution. I'm running 315/70-17's on my 06 Ram, with stock wheels and a leveling kit. The tires now rub the mud flaps when I turn the wheel. Doesn't bother me enough to take the mud flaps off but just wanted to throw that out there.I'll update if anything changes.

81-l+cidO0L._SY88.jpg
The fitment was 99% on these with it dropping in perfect. I found if you over tighten the rear bolt at all, it will cause the door to flex and no longer open by itself with the spring loaded mechanism inside, so I had to loosen it a bit until it finally did. Otherwise dropped right in, 5 min install. Only giving 4 stars because mine had a HUGE dent on the corner of it, and for how well this thing was packed (I've honestly seen $3,000 scopes with less packing than this, it was truly fantastic) I can only assume it happened before the unit was boxed up, and no one noticed, or no one cared. If they contact me and replace it with one that isn't damaged, id gladly offer 5 stars, and buy another in a heartbeat!Edit - Lock'er Down sent me a brand new safe and stated Fed Ex had been a bit rough with a few of their boxes. The new one came in perfect condition, along with a call tag for the old one. Since there is virtually nothing wrong with it, their customer service is fantastic, and I have a brand new non damaged safe, I am a happy camper! Still has the smaller corner that hangs up if you tighten the bolts too much, and would like to see larger washers on the bolts, but you will NOT be disappointed with purchasing one of these!

I used this to refinish the faded wood dash panels on my boat, and it turned out great! I love the look, and the wood grain texture in the vinyl is a nice touch as well. Got a nice updated finish for a fraction of the price of new panels. Hope it holds up to the sun and AZ heat.

I had looked at a few of the spinner knobs price range low to high. I decided to get this one because it had alot of favorable reviews. Takes a little getting used to but it works great. I put the knob on top of my steering wheel cover so I wouldn't mar the actual steering wheel. (see picture). The instructions (suggest) for right handed, place at 2 o'clock and for left, place at 10 o'clock. Mine feels most comfortable at almost 3 o'clock position.I definately recommend purchasing. You can't go wrong for this price.

You have to get the spray bottle with this. Once diluted it's very effective and easy to use. I used this when I changed out brake pads, while wheels were off.

This combination works surprisingly well together.  While not an aggressive brake pad, they provide confident stops and VERY little brake dust.  The rotors still look very good after 14 months and 7,000 miles on my daily driver as shown in the photo.  The protective coating has prevented any rust on the visible part of the rotor hat even after exposure to plenty of road salt this past winter.  The ceramic brake pads have plenty of life left and have not caused any rotor scoring even with my spirited driving.

Great quality parts.  Much more substantial than the original V6 parts.  Took just under 2 hours to put them both in.  The hardest part is getting the long front bolt out because the inner tie rod bellows are in the way.Instead of unbolting the rack and pinion as the book says to do, I loosened the upper strut mount bolts and that allowed the tie rod to move just enough to get the bolt out.Putting it all back in is easier!The manual says you can reverse the rear bolts and put the bills in from top down so you can use a ratchet to tighten them and then torque then to specs.These eliminated all my clunks and squeaks.How they hold up for the rest of the life of this 2007 Mustang with 121,000 miles!

Really like this tool. I was about to order a set in a case that would take up too much room but this thing takes up less room and does everything I need it to do. Easily removes and installs pulleys.A couple of notes though, like another user said, the face of the tool is just a bit thick to slide onto the pulley so I used a die grinder with a roloc wheel to just take off the texture and smooth out the face and now it fits perfect. Took about 30 seconds with a roloc wheel. Also there is a hole in the remover part and the instructions never mention this but you can put a 3/8 ratchet extension in here to hold the remover while you drive the bolt in to remove pulleys.Also don't forget the little sleeve when you go to remove a pulley like I did and bugger up the threads in the pump. Luckily I caught something wasn't going right soon enough to stop and start over with the sleeve and I was able to repair the threads with a tap.

Really impressed with this pack of PCV hoses. They might be Chinese and not be molded perfect, but they are molded well and without issues. They fit together for me easily. The Y pipe in this kit comes off the 1.8t valve cover, then back to the turbo, and is most common for splitting in the middle of the Y. Then, the second most common is the S pipe in this kit which is the one I needed the most. Really appreciate you guys offering this, and with Prime shipping.

I purchased this in April 2015 but just returned home to find this strainer I ordered. It says "In-Line Strainer" the order says "In-Line Strainer;however, this is an "Inlet Style" strainer and it even shows the two styles on the back of the package. This style is made to plug directly into a QUAD pump not inline with the supply hose. And of course it's too late to return it.

These are absolutely awesome! I was upgrading my 2008 Class C RV, I have been to a lot of RV dealer ships, living here in Indiana and these lights appear to be the exact LED's that are in all the New Class C RV's. I have inspected the LED's at the dealerships up close and they look the same. They sit in a track like the ones on the new RV's. They are covered in deep clear rubbery plastic, like a 1/4" at least. The other LED's we were looking at were thin like take, the RecPro's look a lot more solid glad I picked these.

Clean wife's suv in the garage when raining and cold outside. Only used one wet rag and one dry rag. Did so good I then cleaned my F350 dually in about 1 1/2 hrs (after the weather cleared up) using one wet rag and two dry rags. Started on top and worked down as instructed. Cleaned paint, chrome, vinyl, windows. No heavy dirt but lots of road film. Mainly got it to use on rv when camping but keep finding other usages. By the way, used about 10 oz on big truck and 6 oz on suv.

I bought these for my 2000 H-D Electra Glide Ultra Classic. The spots didn't come with the right connections to replace my oem so I had to cut them off and crimp on some connectors but otherwise they were a direct fit in the housings. The headlight was plug and play and fit nicely inside the sunpie trim ring purchased separately. The lights are very bright, much brighter than the stock bulbs. Compared to the H-D daymakers these are a worthy buy thats much less expensive. I would recommend these to anyone looking for better brighter light.

I Thank all the folks for writing reviews, what year this fits and videos on how they are installed.  It looks great on our 2012 Genesis.  Took more time getting the old glue off without scratching the paint, install was quick and easy.If you add the hood emblem like I did, you will need the studs grinded off.  Was pretty simple as well, cut them off then grinded them down with a small grinder.  The hardest part was getting it lined up where I wanted it.  Once its stuck, its stuck.Watch the recommended video everyone shared, you can do it !!!

Right out of the box you can tell that these LEDs are very well made (compared to others I've used in the past). The build quality feels absolutely solid and the light emitted is nice and bright. I bought the 30mm versions for my Scion xA's map & trunk light and they fit perfectly.

Out of all the "repair kits" for whatever thing, this is the the first one that I feel I won the lottery with!My wife's windshield was pretty messed up. A whole "band" of scratches, the width of half of a wiper. I could feel the scratches a little bit with my fingernail and I didn't have any real hopes that this could actually work. Fortunately, I was so wrong!So, I did my research and did the following:- got my corded drill- a 3 inch glass polishing felt pad and adapter for drill (both cheap on Amazon)- I initially used masking tape to separate the scratch in 2 parts and worked on half of the scratch so that I see the difference (see pictures)- I kept the solution wet all the time and sprayed probably after every 40 seconds of high speed polishing.- I used the drill on high and at a slight angle (if you use full surface on, it will tend to jump all over)- moved back and forth fairly fast- I stopped after 15-20 minutes and wiped the windshield to see if there's any difference. WOW! That's when I took the pictures that I attach here, because the effect was so unbelievable! You can see a clear separation line between what was polished (right in front of the driver's view) and the left side of the driver's view. Initially that scratch band went all the way to the side of the windshield (following the motion of the wiper)- it was indeed messy and you can't clean it just with a hose. Either pressure wash or classic wash with a sponge or brush but just water won't remove the cerium oxide.All in all, I spent a total of $20, 45 minutes of polishing and 20 minutes washing the car. For an hour of work, the results are really amazing. I gave it a 20% chance before I started but, boy, I underestimated this technique!

The picture is after an honest restart of the mileage computer and then a 25 mile drive,. My truck has averaged 15.9 mpg since I bought it new,  I am really surprised at how well it did and as I type this its been about 2 weeks and the mileage is now stuck at 18.1mpg. I don't hyper mile and I am in traffic alot so these are pretty honest readings I would think. For a full sized crew cab I am very impressed and wish did this years ago. As for install I am not very mechanically inclined at all. I watched the only video on Youtube probably 5 times before I started.  The install is very easy and isn't going to take hours. But do save the ring tighteners from your old system when you remove it. One of the rings provided was too small - the old factory ring fit perfect and will do the job. I wasn't missing any bolts and moving the air flow sensor was easy just use a pair of pliers on the factory bolt holding it on and it will come right off. It does sound different when accelerating but nothing obnoxious or annoying.

You get two of these in the package along with an assortment of crimp wire connectors. Great way to clean those wires up and the battery terminals and gives you a nice clean connection. These can even be used as a ground. Pricing wasn't too bad. Good product.

Amazing quality!! Really thick too. Couldnt be happier. I used a heat gun.Didnt have patience to wait in between the rain and wind so I did it at night and there is some slight imperfections which are my fault, but you cant really tell unless you're up real close and looking for it. Happy it came with extra, because I ended up needing to do that back one 3 times until it was decent..Overall I love it and Im buying more as backup!!

This is the second set of these bags I have installed on a vehicle I owned and they work phenomenally.  In my case it is a 2015 Dodge Ram 2wd, and they installed in about 45 minutes.  I wasn't really pushing myself for a speed record, but it is certainly something you can do in an afternoon.  I do have to say, on the Ram it is easier if you just drop the shock connections so the axle has more room to flex, then the coils just fall out.

I purchased these for my 2012 Acura TL. They replaced my daytime running lights (brights). I installed them myself. I simply unplugged the old bulbs and put these in with no additional hardware.  My car now alerts me to check my DRL system, but they light up just fine. I may need a ballast, but it is not bugging me enough to go right out and do it. They do not flicker. The color is a very deep blue. It's almost a bit too flashy, but I like the look. They are not replacements for brights. They will be no brighter than your low beams. When you activate your brights at night, all you will see is a hint of blue added to your low beams. I knew this before my purchase, so no surprise there.  If you are driving at night a lot, I would look at something different.  In any case, these will really add a lot of character to your car.

I installed these in the center high mount stop lamp and licence plate lights on my 05 Town and Country. I wouldn't say they're any brighter than incandescent bulbs. They do produce a nice clean white light and that's important. I'm also hoping they last longer. It's only ba couple weeks but I'm happy with them so far.

I bought this windshield for my Honda CB250F. It fits my bike perfectly, the handlebar clamps work tight and are easy to install (a plastic spacer is provided for each clamp so the handlebar is not scratched), and once the screen is set it sits on it's place. The screen quality seems  great. I highly recommend it.

This was less at Amazon than at etrailer.com (also great place to buy trailer parts). It bolts right up to my 2003 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor P71. I use one of the supplied spacers between the hitch and the car frame at each bolt to keep it down off the rear bumper. I did not need the wedge shaped "leveling" pieces on this car. MAKE SURE you drill the rear (closest to the bumper) holes as close to the inside of the frame (towards the middle of the car) as you can or ... you'll be sorry! If you stick your finger up inside the frame before you drill you will see what I mean, the bumper "shock" is right above the hole and the bolt will NOT go down if it's not drilled in that position. Course, if the bolt was a little shorter, it might give a little wiggle room. As a shade tree mechanic, I use a second floor jack to hold the hitch in place while I align it and drill the holes.

Just what I needed to convert the tongue on my Buffalo Turbine blower to a ball hitch instead of the pin hitch it came with. My yard is rather uneven in spots (ok, everywhere) and the pin hitch was getting bent and beat up constantly. Now that issue is a thing of the past and the blower is connected to the tractor far more securely. I used my angle grinder to remove the pin hitch, ground everything smooth, painted the bare metal with Rustoleum, then drilled & bolted the new hitch unto the trailer tongue with stainless steel bolts and self locking nuts. It ain't goin' anywhere now.

Highly recommend this Canbus HID Kit w/ Relay Harness & Capacitors. Product was packaged extremely well and included everything needed for a professional setup and installation.  Installation on my 2013 Hyundai Sonata GLS required the relay to offset the draw of electrical current from the vehicle wiring harness and to eliminate any possible damage to the electrical system.  If you're ever in doubt if you need a relay, install one.  It's better to protect the electrical system then to find out the hard way.  Having installed several HID systems on previous vehicles, installation was straight forward with the relay and capacitors.  The included instructions were written very well and were easy to follow.  Each ballast has a good amount of weight and build quality to them which is appreciated and demonstrates the differences between this higher-end product and cheaper lower quality products.  Each bulb matched the 6000K color rating exactly on my setup and they look amazing in my projectors.  The light is crisp white with a very slight hint of blue.  OPT7 appears to stand behind this products as indicated by other reviewers.

This is probably my 20th helmet after 16 years of riding. This thing is awesome! I was expecting a cheap piece of crap but it's really nice to look at and gets tons of looks. One benefit I didn't think about was sound proofing. It's really nice to have something to keep the wind noise down. The size chart was spot on for me and honestly didn't think it would fit from how small it appeared out of the box. Which is actually a very nice thing because it doesn't give you the typical mushroom head and fits tightly around my head. Buy it or you're not a true patriot!

Purchased and used to replaced a burnt out license plate bulb on my 3rd gen Camry.Why I gave 3/5 stars for my rating:Great brightness for the size and wattageLoad resistance is built right in; making this is a drop-in replacementThe dimensions (especially the length from socket to tip of lens) is about the same as the bulbs it can replace  -other LED replacement products for 168/194 are merely "compatible" and less-so than thisWhy not a higher rating?PRICE.  Although a quality product, it would be very expensive if the intent is to replace multiple incandescent bulbs in my car.I recommend this product to folks who may want to just have one bright bulb shining on their license plate, instead of 1-2 traditional bulbs that not very bright, even when new.If these were less expensive (and eh-hmm... if they were legal for this purpose) I would consider swapping them in for my parking lights.  I also have some interior lights out, or that I may want to replace with LEDs for brighter gauges and courtesy lights on doors; these bulbs are not worth the cost for these other purposes.

This product was great for me I have a 93 Miata with what used to be broken manual locks the drivers side was permanently unlocked and passengers always locked, but with this kit I was able to not only fix my broken locks but now they are powered locks! The installation was really simple one wire to 12v positive one to ground (12v negative works the same) only problem I had was I had pulled one wire of of the white clip so everything would light up and make a click noise but would not lock or unlock but after a couple angry minutes I found the problem. And by the way this is a single controller door lock and three follower power locks.

--SEE MY UPLOADED PHOTOS OF ORIGINAL AND REPLACMENT SHIPMENTS--The cover is ok, just ok! The mounting hardware, while a simple and efficient design, feels cheap.The biggest problem with this product is what I would describe as incredibly poor packaging from the manufacturer, there is no design to it at all, and it is almost totally inefficient.The first cover I ordered was damaged in a number of areas (see photos I posted).This was not the fault of Amazon or UPS it was in my opinion due solely to the poor manufacture's packaging -- Amazon is always great had the damaged one picked up and sent me a replacement.The replacement was damaged also, but not as badly as the first. I contacted the manufacture for repair parts, which they shipped promptly, but would not have been needed if the packaging included any thought. There was also misaligned seals on this replacement cover, so obvious that I have to wonder how they made it out of the factory, shows very poor quality control (again see posted photos).The whole experience was a terrible inconvenience and I would not do it again. I suggest if you need a cover you look to another manufacturer

For a $100 rack it's good.  The plastic screw lock knows  that holds the bike rack portion and allows it to be folded flush Take a lot of turns to loosen. There is also a screw on the bottom of each side of the rack for the end caps  that sticks out and will scratch your bikes.Beware. If I had known I would've removed those screws and replaced them with flush mounted screws before I used it.My fix was to remove them and install a flat interior panel type screw that I heated up so it would melt into the plastic and not be exposed anymore. I wish I did this before it scratched my bike.The rack also has free play forward and backwards. So when your driving it bounces up and down some but is ok.It is stable from side to side though.Last but not least my bike almost fell off while driving on the freeway into directly into head winds of  40-60 mph the rubber strap came undone on 1 side and my bike was dangling.It was  my fault because I didn't tie the bike down with the included tie downs. I would also highly recommend this merchant because they are taking my recommendations to the manufacture for future product improvement. I have used this rack about 6 times with no further problems Overall  I would recommend this rack

So far so good. I have not had any of the proble.s some have listed in there reviews but i did update mine before installing it. The gps is easy to use and clear to read even on the sunniest days. The battery life is incredible when it's not docked and I really like the motorcycle specific features for maintanance and fuel. Base camp is easy to utilize and uploading your routes is simple and fast. Very happy with this gps and recommend it to everyone. Also to clarify this come with the gps, motorcycle cradle with handlebar mound, car suction cup mount and 12v charger for the car.

These seem really strong and well-built. However, they are not usable by me. I bought them to secure things between the E-Track rails on either side of my trailer, which are about 3-ft apart. Even going over all the items I need to secure, the length of strap between one end and the buckle is so long that I have no room to cinch it down on the items. The distance between the buckle and the fixed side of the strap is over 4 feet, which means you really can only strap things down between E-Track rails that are well over four feet apart.

Works very well. No complaints. My speedo broke and this fits the bill perfectly. The pictures show that I placed it on top of my steering colum where there is a flat, stationary surface. It sits under the hood of my gauge cluster, projecting the readout on my gauge glass. This location also serves to protect the unit from direct sun rays, as well as to keep clutter off my dash. It has no problem connecting to gps in this position. It is also very accurate when tested with a gps app on my phone.

These are fabulous. We used to be those people that took their motorhome and blocks of wood out and giggled at people that would pay $30 bucks for the same thing as $1.97 in a length of wood cut up...We just came back from a 2 and a half week road trip from IL to WA state and back. These were amazing. Easy to knock the dirt out of them, easy to clean, easy to gauge how many you will need to level and did not warp at all under the weight of the motorhome. We bought this set and we are going to buy another set for us and one for our parents.Carrying case is great and keeps them all together as well. Just buy them.

I was hesitant to order these, because they are so cheap compared to the name brand hand guards that cost 3X more. They look very similar to the expensive name brand ones, and are of very good quality.The install would have taken approximately 20 minutes, but my set was missing one of the cone shaped nuts that go with the anchor assembly that mounts inside the handle bar end. A trip to home depot, another $2.50, and I was back in business (A 6mm nut,  and a brass compression sleeve from the plumbing section worked rather well).I did rotate my levers down some for clearance, but if I don't like them that way, I could cut the balls off the end of the levers and rotate them back up.Because they look so good on the bike, and because of the excellent quality (not so good quality control), I still give them 5 stars.I have them installed on a 2005 KLR 650. I've added some pics to the product page.

I bought these for my 2004 Lincoln LS to change the bulbs to LED from Halogen and increase visibility at night, but I had no idea what an amazing difference this product makes in my car. Not only does it increase visibility but it makes my 12 year old car just as fearsome and awesome looking as the new cars off the lots. If you're looking for a set of LED lights, look no further than these. Not only is this a great product but I was pleasantly surprised when I opened my package to find the lights nestled in an aluminum box with foam cutouts to protect my investment. That shows me that this company cares about its customers. Thank you!

In the ancient musical "Gypsy", the veteran strippers explain to the new stripper that to make it in this business where so many others are competing, you need to have a gimmick or a feature which distinguishes your product from the crowd.In a world swimming with hockey puck Bluetooth speakers, the IBSound does have a gimmick and it's that it's water resistant. Note, though, that despite the long title, it is not waterproof. The instructions are clear that it can be splashed but not immersed. In testing here, the speaker did just fine in the shower and also outside during rain and snow. I let the snow melt on the speaker and it seemed to suffer no harm from the experience.This becomes one of those items you don't know you want until you have it. Being able to listen to radio in the shower and even speak on the phone (the speaker acts like a speaker phone during calls) suddenly is something I wonder how I did without now that I am not doing without. It's just loud enough to be easily heard above the shower water noise. That said, the sound is typical for a hockey puck speaker which means about the quality of cell phone speakers but louder. It's just great for talk radio but nothing to get excited about for music.The sample received here comes with a mountaineer sort of clip to hang the speaker or a large mama jamma of a suction cup which holds the speaker very well to any smooth surface. The controls are the usual slightly annoying press and hold to turn on and off rather than a positive sliding or flipping switch turning the device on or off. However, once you get the hang of it, operating the switches is easy. The speaker also gives aural notifications when turned on or off.If you are in the market for a hockey puck Bluetooth speaker, you may as well get this one because it's as good as any plus it's water resistant. Even you decide you won't wish to use it on a boat or in a shower or in the rain (well, somebody might) it works dry as well so you lose nothing. I just wish that it, as well as other hockey puck speakers tested, was a bit louder or had better fidelity for music.

Totally changes the look of the bike. Overall, very sturdy and an awesome value. Installation took maybe two minutes and shipping wasn't nearly as long as I expected (it ships from China).

It is NOT even the color of chrome, it is an ugly gold plastic. I was super disappointed when I opened the box. Does not match the silver accents on my car.

It is ok. It does not eliminate all handle jiggle noise so I have to use a little hockey tape to keep my jack from sounding all clanky. Also the price is a little high. Keeps the handle from falling out so it gets 4 stars. But between this the base and the mount (needed jack accesories) they cost more than the jack itself.

These batteries worked perfectly for our alarm system. Battery replacement was exactly the same size as the other batteries and it fit right into the panel. These batteries are also the same size as most UPS batteries so you should be able to use them for that as well.

This Wrangler sticker looks good on my Jeep JK. Every time that I look at a Sahara or Rubicon with the name on the hood I wonder why Jeep did not put one on the Wrangler, especially since it costs so little. This sticker is easy to apply using the included directions. After the decal is initially applied to the hood use the included plastic squeegee and go over the decal several times. Let it sit while you do the other side. I then removed the clear film that kept the letters arranged so that the only thing remaining on the hood was the letters. The letters stayed on the hood and none attempted to come off when I removed the clear film.Now my Jeep Wrangler looks even better.

Use sparingly and have a 2nd microfiber towel around to wipe off excess. Used on my 2 year old 2p13 Shelby GT500 matte stripes. Gave them a satin look thay I love better than matte.  I love this product and would recommend to anyone seeking vinyl rejuvenation.

Just installed these on my 01 Chevy S10 Xtreme, one of the best purchase's I've made so far. Comes with all the hardware, bushings, washers, etc. My truck drives nice and smooth now, didn't realize how bad it actually was until I swapped out my old dead ones for these. Shipping was fast, and install was easy, I suggest watching a YouTube video if your new to this and are doing the work yourself. Might I add these are listed on Monores website as premium grade shocks and I only paid half the price on amazon vs going to a parts store or any other website! I suggest greasing your zerk fittings on your front end while replacing the shocks since your under your vehicle anyways. Very happy with this purchase!

This review has nothing yet to do with the performance of this product but rather first impressions. The box looks kind of cheap but the product...wow.  This thing is a beast.  I love the thick wall of the tube, the well-defined and sturdy threads and the pistol grip.  Everything about this screams "STURDY."  The finger grip is solid die cast steel.  It is not formed aluminum/steel like most.  The plunger is 95% steel and only 5% rubber gasket.  This is good news for keeping grease from escaping around the back of the plunger.  Overall first impressions --- outstanding.

Replacing the rear lights was the easiest upgrade so far. Remove two screws, slide light away from body, detach cable and replace with much cooler lights. Had these on for a while and no issues or moisture.  I'm completely happy and loving these lights!

If you apply it properly, it can take a faded frame and make it look like new. Great product to keep the Midwest winters from ruining your steel brake lines as well. Very convenient application in a spray can. Attached pictures for reference.

Quick ship, color is darker then picture shown for beige. Also, steering wheel cover should not be shipped folded & bent. Ship as shape of a steering wheel with cardboard inside the cover. No microfiber on cover as stated, vinyl. Took about 10 minutes to install top to bottom. Fit is good & will protect from dirt, sun & wear & tear.

I just ordered my 2nd set.I tow a 36 foot travel RV trailer they do great. I take these off road and as long as the tires spin , to clear the lugs they get traction. They are great on rocks and tough as nails. You can buy Patriot tires for twice the money or save your wallet and get these.They are loud and you MUST rotate them every other oil change and rebalance them when you do . Go somewhere and get buy a package where you can get lifetime rotation and balance or take them to wally world.You won't find a better bargain on a great  E load mud tire.I got 40000 miles off of my set .

I have a 2006 Harley Spotster XL883C and the led light changes everything.Shipping: FAST PRIMEInstall: Very easy = plug and play. I did however notice that that cant install it with the top rubber part so what I did was removed the top rubber part and put a washer in the pin screw to hold it down. Drove for maybe 60 miles so far and it's riding good. I have an XL custom so I put the little receiver thing inside the headlight housing. All in all it took me maybe 15 minutes to change. The putting back of the pin took me maybe 10 minutes- the rest was really easy. As soon as you turn on the bike without the motor you'll hear the fan.Usability: the LED makes everything brighter, however, maybe because I haven't seen it moving I've only been on the bike I feel that if the light isn't pointing to you then you may not see it as much. Something halogen lights are better at. BUT I can finally see the pot holes in NY a little better and the traffic see's you better.Con: nothing.

These Fit System mirrors are also the K-Source 3891 that you might find elsewhere. I bought these for my 1997 4Runner to use when I tow my pop up camper. These mirrors fit great but are not long enough to see behind the camper even a little. I have to wait for turns or sway the trailer a little to see if anyone is behind me. They do fit very snug with only minor vibration. I just bought the Camco 25664 Towing Mirror that attaches via suction cup. I'm going to stick that one on this mirror on the driver side and see if it helps some before I can get my backup camera installed. Ill report back after.

After years of running my 98 Civic LX on a cracked manifold, I decided to finally replace it. The ATP was a nearly-exact match to factory (see uploaded images) and arrived exactly as described. It came with new gaskets (mount to block and lower pipe), new hardware for the lower pipe mount, the new heat shield and bolts as well as a warranty registration card. The manifold and catalytic converter were already assembled. My only complaint is that the catalytic converter seemed to be set a little too close to the engine at the bottom which caused it to touch the engine bay and compress the heat shield. The compressed heat shield combined with the larger nuts included for the connection to the lower pipe made it difficult to get the nuts tightened--but worked eventually. All-in-all, it was a really good fit and I am happy that my exhaust leak is fixed. I replaced the O2 sensors at the same time with some Bosch ones (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bosch-13007-Oxygen-Sensor-OE-Type-Fitment/dp/B000BZG5OO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bosch 13007 Oxygen Sensor, OE Type Fitment</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bosch-13249-Oxygen-Sensor-OE-Type-Fitment/dp/B000BZI1C8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bosch 13249 Oxygen Sensor, OE Type Fitment</a>) that I have reviewed separately.Word of Caution: Be careful to soak the existing bolts in a good penetrating oil to prevent breaking the mounting studs in the engine block. I used some PB Blaster and was fortunate enough to not break any bolts. I have seen countless cases of people who were not so lucky.Final Verdict: I recommend the ATP Exhaust Manifold based on my limited experience with it since installing it two days ago. The real test will be how well it lasts.I hope my review helps someone.

For about 5$ a filter how can you go wrong.  I put a little more than a 1000 miles a month on my bike, so doing my own oil change every 5,000 miles add up.  Add 3 quarts of Mobil 1 VTwin oil and your good to go.  If you need one quick, you can pick one up at my local O'Reillys like I did.  Its a little bit cheqper on Amazon though. And Made in the USA!

This is one of the most soft leather jackets that I've owned, in the first opening of the package. The built in body armor spots give me confidence on my ride. The added air vents make sure it's not to hot.  There are plenty of pockets and even one that seems prefect for things that go bang.It's really a nice upgrade from my textile jacket or fake leather jacket.

The left side I didn't have no problem installing it at all, but the right side I had to drill the hole on the grab bar a little bit deeper so the screw can reach the hole on my bar on my jeep. Other then that the grab bar is great! It does makes a big difference getting in and out off the jeep.

My couch has never looked so shiny! I simply followed the directions on the bottle, used a microfiber rag, and polished away! The leather lotion didn't leave any residue and moisturized some heavily worn areas very nicely! I polished a love seat, and full couch and the bottle is still mostly full. You'll get MANY uses from this 1 bottle.

I bought this jumper pack because of the construction of the clamps and overal quality. After looking through many jumper packs, both more expensive and cheaper, I found this one to have great reviews and appeared to have a solid construction.Upon receiving the package it seemed much heavier than I expected ( it's not heave, just didn't expect the weight that comes with the quality). I really liked the all metal clamps that come with this unit. Many others have plastic pivot points vs the metal ones on these. Many other product reviews pointed out this plastic pivot point to be a weak spot.  The clamps on this one are all metal frame with a plastic sleeve over them. 100% opposite of the majority and a big sell point for me. This is also why the box was heavier than expected the clamps are all metal and good size, not small at all.  I have read the instructions and they are well thought out and explain every button and action of the jumper packs abilities.  Another great quality is the dust covers over every port. Both USB in/ out ports have an attached dust cover, and so does the port to plug up the clamps. The clamps are joined at one end with a quality cap and dust cover same as on the actual jumper pack. This will extend the life of the unit as a whole and reduce issues with charging and jumping down the road.  I only have 2 " needs improvement" thoughts. 1st, add more USB out ports... as of now only one USB device can be plugged in and charged off the pack. 2nd, a better ability to carry it over the bag it comes in. With the power button and all function buttons to be very easily pressed, a bag instead of a solid body case is a possible problem. If in the bag, something is set on top of it or bumped it could turn the unit on and it drain out or turn on the flash light and it drain out. To solve this I purchased a $3 clear plastic tackle box that is just large enough to carry everything that comes with this.I will update on actual jumping ability with time.

It says and shows 10" but it is only 8.5". Being returned within mins of receipt. Fix the description. Be prepared to have a mothball smell for mths. Smells harmful and very stinky.  The company claims the top and bottom are different dimensions but showing their own photo you can see they are wrong.

If you don't want to replace the factory bumper on your jeep but still want a the ability to have a bar / off road lights then this is the thing to get. My ordered arrived promptly and without issue.

Just installed on my 2002 Lexus RX300. No fitment issues. Looks to be identical in construction and design as the OEM filter (87139-48020), with the exception of a very small amount of activated carbon. Others have mentioned fitment issues but I can assure you, there are none. No trimming, jamming, etc. Perhaps they have the orientation wrong or received a bad/old batch?I value clean air so I try to buy the best filters! Every bit of help counts, hence I require activated carbon filters. Regardless of filter, replace every 6-12 months to ensure fresh clean air.I have marked down to two stars because the amount of activated carbon in this filter is paltry. Honestly, it looks like someone just sprinkled a few specs of pepper in the filter! I have had several other activated carbon filters before and this one is amazingly pathetic. I have three of these ATP filters so it's not just a bad one.

The 5-year warranty is completely FALSE and deceptive but who's going to start a class-action lawsuit?I bought a pair of Suspa C16-06389 struts as replacements for the oem struts on my Leer camper shell about 22 months ago. One of the two has failed, zero gas pressure.$20 is CHEAP for a pair of gas pressurized struts but it does seem that I got what I paid for, either counterfeit, somehow not up to spec or Suspa overcharges badly on their own site for same crap struts but back them up with a 5-year warranty knowing that they can replace them two or three times under warranty and still profit.

Okay let me start off by saying that this bad boy is loud. As soon as I installed it the first thing I did was laugh. It's everything I was hoping it would.Excellent sounds and you can hear from far when speaking through it.Very impressed with everything.Depending on where your going to put it and  connect it, it can be a mission but not impossible.I put it under the hood and wired it through the bottom to reach the steering wheel. It connects to the ignition. So it turns on and off when I start the truck.have fun and stay safe.

I've only used it for one trip thus far - I'll edit this if I need to.It does what it says.  It's very easy to set up if you take your time and follow directions (imagine that).  Our first trip we encountered a very substantial rain storm on the first night which lasted hours. It had rained earlier (see muddy truck) but we got lucky with a break as we got to the campsite.  I got it set up moments before another storm started. We set up the rest of our camp and had dinner, etc. under a tarp, as the entirety of the Amazon River was loosed upon us. We turned in late that night - dry as a bone, and woke the next morning dry, too. Condensation is always a factor with tents, and was there in the mornings - but the shelter absolutely keeps rain out. I can't speak to wind stability yet, but if (when) it happens I will edit.The zippers are small and seem rather delicate. I'm definitely taking my time with them, I'd prefer stronger zippers and seams. The tent is also very thin, and I can't see how the stitching doesn't rip - but it doesn't. This little tent is designed well, and so far it's pretty tough.So far, I'm very happy.

I love them. They look amazing. I actually cut mine since all the lashes are just to much and I wanted it to resemble my signature winged eyeliner look. They stuck well until I wacked one off then I just popped the other one off to make it even till I can fix it. It might be that it's not really 3m tape but I might install them on Velcro so my husband can take them off when he needs the jeep and not feel weird about driving it. On the flip side, if you don't want boys playing with your toys.. Slap some eyelashes on it, it'll do all the work for you.

Just received the 18738 for my new 2017 Ford Escape Titanium model. This model has rubber gasket under the front edge of the hood now that the 2013 model I had did not have. I have emailed Lund CS to ask about the proper install or if no install. Looks to me that I have to remove the gasket, install the shield, and then drill hole sin shield to reinstall the gasket. Will post when I get an answer.Update: decide to return as did not want to drill 10 holes in the deflector so to be able to reinstall the gasket. Not sure that there would have been enough clearance left between gasket and front grill after installing the deflector. Deflector might have worked fine if the gasket were left off. But it being a new car did not want to affect warr.

I bought these to replace a burnt out headlight on my 2002 Nissan Maxima. From the research I did online I found that the Maximas that come with HID lights stock have 4100K D2R bulbs in them. After looking around these bulbs seemed to be at a price that was too good to be true but the reviews I read were good so I gave them a shot. I chose to get the 6000K bulbs because they were a little cheaper. They are brighter and more white than the original lights, and have a tiny bit of a bluish tint compared to the stock lights.Installing them was not bad at all, it took about 20 minutes altogether. This article has really good instructions for changing headlights on a 2002-2003 Maxima, complete with pictures:[...]I am very pleased with these bulbs. I loved replacing both lights at the same time so they are both the same tint and brightness. It has only been a few days since I put them in, I'll update if I have any problems with them.**Note: These bulbs will only replace HID bulbs (the bright white lights, not the more common yellow-tinted bulbs).

When I saw these in person I wanted them right away! The shop was selling them for about $490 came on here and saw a big price difference and ordered immediately! Bolted right up to the stock holes so drilling is required! They make my tundra stand out more! Already had other Tundra owners compliment them and asked what brand they were! I added a few pictures (white tundra) just to give and idea of what they look like!

So I bought this after my last puncture left me with an expensive tow and tire replacement bill... Fast forward a year, I've just put a brand new set of Pirelli Angel GTs on my Versys 650. I hadn't even done 200 miles on them when I noticed a screw had become embedded in the front tire when I arrived at work this morning. Argh! I whipped out this kit which I carry in my top box, and 20 mins later had the tire successfully plugged and inflated. Wonderful product - can't recommend highly enough! IMPORTANT NOTE: this kit DOES NOT come with a set of pliers (needed to pull the offending shard out of the tire but ALSO to set the plug on the inside of the tire once its in). The toolkit that came with my bike (under the seat) has pliers - but it yours doesn't you'll need to buy a pair to add to this kit.

Incredible. My factory Honda battery gave up after 2 years and I sure as heck wasn't bothering with a dealership. I chose an OPTIMA as they have carbon fiber covers for them as well, thus giving me a good engine bay dress up option as well.Overall, the battery makes a great difference on starting power in addition with my new AEM Spark Plugs. The additional 90 minutes of standby time is great for my BBQ's @ Phillies games and just shootin' the time with friends at car meets. Not to mention --- this battery is light and completely sealed/leak proof. A must have for any performance difference is a new battery and, trust me, this is the primal choice.For the best performance and results, I always recommend upgrading/replacing your standard factory-installed battery terminals. They  tend to corrode and become crap after time and the factory grounds are always weak. Make sure you rub the grounding point (the opposite end of the Black terminal where it is attached to the car chassis) with sand paper to get off any paint residue or potential corrosion from the steel bolts.For the BEST results, buy a grounding kit and voltage stabilizer!I will add more pictures this evening.

Very sturdy and compact. The hard plastic and size makes it tough to decouple but it is a quality unit.

All mechanics know that Moog is pretty much the best chassis brand out there.  I've been using their products for many years.  1989-1997 Thunderbirds and Cougars are known to have strut-rod bushing issues.  Using these PLASTIC bushings is NOT the way to fix the problem!  I meticulously installed these on my 1993 LX show-car.  Even harvested the metal cup-washers from the original rubber front bushings, in order to give these plastic ones a true, flat surface to mount against (hole has a rolled lip).  After installing, first thing I noticed was excessive, harsh steering-column vibrations.  800 miles later the driver's side, rear bushing actually cracked and FELL OUT while I was driving!!  Luckily I was only 3 miles from home, and was able to limp the car back.  I'd like to sue MOOG for producing such a inferior product!  I should have heeded the warnings posted all over the internet about these, especially from "TCCOA.com" which is a must-visit site for any owner of these cars!  The ONLY fix for the stock ford bushings, is OEM Ford parts, which are still available seperately.  You must re-use the original "crush-sleeve", as it is discontinued now.  After fitting new Ford rubber parts on both ends of the strut-rods, that smooth, cushioned feeling was restored.  Double rubber-insulated strut-rods were a selling point on this model when new, by the way.

It came today and it was or is already installed 2 hours later, LEAK FREE. It's just as sturdy as the nissan oem and I think it's actually built better than nissan oem!It is a single core but you have to look at my pictures at the big difference between the original Nissan core tubes and to the Spectra!The Spectra core tubes are definitely bigger

Review of TriMark T507 AKA 060-1650This lock is a much better design then the older model that it replaced in my 2001 motorhome. Kudos to the TriMark engineers. My opinion of their manufacturing, however, is another matter. Everything is great except for the most vulnerable part -- the latch bolt. The end where the handle pulls back the latch is only two strips of metal about 1/8" square (see photos). This is the second time I have had to replace this lock because it broke there, and the second time we were locked out and had to drill out the hinge pins so I could reach in with long nose pliers to retract the latch. The first T507 replacement broke at that point after only two years.From my experience as an engineer in a big company, I suspect that someone in marketing insisted on saving 20 cents by using pot metal instead of steel. Such a foolish saving on an otherwise great product with a suggested retail price of almost $150.Installation was simple exce[t that the striker bolts are slightly larger diameter than the old model and wouldn't go into the old striker plate. Of course the new striker plate (included) should be used to replace the original, but that was impossible without cutting away some of the sheet metal door frame. Instead, I replaced the striker bolts with those from the old lock. This requires at Torx T30 driver bit.I would have given this 5 stars, but I deducted two for the pot metal latch and another star for having to change the striker bolts. Unfortunately, there seems to be no alternative to replacing the lock with the same brand.

This fit my 2015 Toyota Rav 4 Limited.  It was a little hard to get the armrest cover to latch.  So I cut off the front lip (see pictures) and then it latched perfectly.The tray definitely keeps all of the necessary stuff close at hand and everything is no longer all dumped into one huge pile!!!

I absolutely love this stuff. Sure, rolling it in my bed takes some time, but the look and durability is great. I first used this about two years ago on my 95 Silverado and it has held up so well that I decided to do it on my latest project - an 84 Ford F-150. Being my second time with this I can say the results were better. A few things Ive learned:1. Use a good quality automotive tape.2. 1 Gallon is the perfect amount for an 8ft truck bed, but Id recommend another quart for touch ups and if you plan to do the tailgate.3. Scuff the bed up and clean it well before starting. Id also recommend a strong degreaser.4. Wear gloves otherwise this stuff will be with you for a couple days.5. Drying times vary. My first coat today took about 6 hours to dry in 70 degree weather. Once its not tacky hit it up with the next layer. Go over it well, preferably with a flash light, to make sure you didn't miss any spots.

I received my mats today. I'm blown away by how well they fit. They are literally a custom fit for the car. There's no wiggle room one way or the other and they aren't too tight that they pucker. They literally fit perfectly.I have a buddy at work that has Weathertechs installed in his Genesis and those stand off the edges a little next to the center console and against the door. Not these. They are super secure and the backing doesn't let them slide at all. The backing is like that fake turf that you might have seen in a 3 season porch or that some people use as outdoor carpet. It's stiff and it grabs the loops in the factory carpet so the mats don't slide. Regardless of that backing, I don't know how the mats could slide since they fit so snugly, but when I tried to shimmy them around they weren't moving.I just received them so I can't speak for how waterproof they are or how well they are going to wear or clean up, but my first impression is an extremely positive one. They are really nice looking, they fit like a glove, and I got them for 70 bucks less than a full set of Weathertechs. The reviews I read before buying were all positive so I have high expectations.Update June 2017:These are so awesome. I live in Minnesota and these were installed all winter. I cleaned them up twice through the winter and each time they cleaned up super easily with some warm water and dish soap. I would HIGHLY recommend these mats. I can confirm they are 100% waterproof. I get tons of compliments from people when they step in my car for the first time. Save $50-75 dollars on the Weathertech's and buy these. You really can't go wrong here.

Great protection for your Hella driving/fog lamps that does not block the light. Who wants to stop and take off light cover to use them??? Might as well lock your hubs while you are out there...Be careful when clipping them on, especially when cold. One cover (out of 6 I have) had one of the tabs crack off. Still functions, I just rotate that part to the bottom. The last set I installed I kept in the house (warmer) until it was time to clip them on.

this is a nice little solid antenna. I read another reviewer who had trouble with theirs rusting almost immediately so I coated my threads with dielectric grease before installing, so far not a problem at all. I didn't notice any degradation of my radio reception however I live fairly close to the city so if you are in a rural area this might not hold true.I added a picture so you can get an idea of the size of the antenna on the truck, it is pretty small.

This was the first LED bulb I've used, so I don't have any others to compare it to, but it is noticeably brighter and whiter than the OEM 1146 bulbs that came installed in my new lawn tractor. The only trouble I have is actually with a design flaw on the tractor, not with the bulb. Because of the way the fixture is designed, half of the LEDs of this bulb are actually BEHIND the reflector, so their light is completely wasted. If I can modify the reflector so that all of the LEDs are visible, it will be incredibly bright!

Close but no cigar... If you use a 9007 bulb you know that there is a plastic retainer clip that the goes behind the bulb and then locks the bulb into the headlight. There is no way to get retainer clip around the bulb to lock it down. Even after cutting the retainer clip to be able to get lock on the back of bulb the cooling fan blocks the ring from closing so you lock the the bulb in. Aside from the fact that I can secure the bulb into the housing meaning it can not be used I was able to test fit the bulb into the housing and test the bulb for brightness and functionality. If this bulb could be used you will be able to see the bulb brightness, throw distance, and pattern all all better that the stock halogen 9007 bulb.Bottom line: due to the fact that the 9007 lamp can not be securely fastened to the lamp housing I DO NOT recommend this as a good LED replacement for the 9007. If there was a way to properly install the 9007 lamp into the housing I would say that it is a good replacement and highly recommend it. I gave this product 2 stars since the product did fit into the housing and functionality of both high and low beams worked and the brightness, throw distance and pattern were all better. but only 2 stars since it could not actually be used.Full Disclosure: This item was supplied to me for free or a reduced cost by the seller to use and evaluate it for their customers. I was not told what to write, nor was I asked to give it a certain rating, nor was I influenced by any party. I don't remove a negative or lower star review at the sellers request, nor will I hold back from posting a 1, 2 or 3 star rating if I find that the item deserves it. I do however reserve the right to modify my review at any time, if during the use of the product the quality or usability changes.

Better quality than OEM. Only needed the o-ring since none of the autoparts near me had it in stock and wanted more than 10 dollars to order the ring itself. Best 10 dollars spent and very accurate sensor.

Love these new latches. They are sturdy and look great and easy to adjust. Instructions for adjusting them isn't as clear cut as I would like, but easy enough to figure out. The bolt inside the fender well is a PITA to get to and remove. Still.....no more hood flutter and they look better than the stock latches.

This tool is garbage.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY.  Buy something that actually has a lock feature or a spanner tool that actually WORKS.  The spanner tool I received with this doesn't do anything.  Yes this polisher functions and Yes it has a powerful motor.  Nothing else is good about this tool.Problem #1 - There is no lock on the tool, so removing the pads is always a pain, if you can even accomplish it.Problem #2 - The instruction booklet says NOTHING about changing the pads or how to use the tools provided.Problem #3 - The U handle is made out of really thin plastic which broke the first time I dropped it.Problem #4 - The "spanner" tool I recieved doesn't even fit this thing at all.  There is no way for me to remove the velcro pad that was provided with the tool at all.Problem #5 - I found my own spanner tool that could lock the polisher pad, then I lost it and now I can't remove the polisher pad.  So this tool is now useless.I purchased this tool almost exactly 6 years ago.  I have never been more frustrated by a tool in my life.  I want my time and my money back, this thing is garbage.

Ordered both the SR4071 and SR4072.  Packages arrived well packed.  Took the old / used struts out of the vehicle and upon initial inspection / comparison, found the strut upper mounts in the KYB SR4071 and SR4072 were MISALIGNED (See pictures).  This is horrible and absolutely none excusable.  I had to take the struts to the shop to have them disassembled and reassembled / aligned right.  KYB, please take your assembly line process seriously!

The Good:- Its fits just about perfectly on a Suzuki Vstrom DL1000 without the bags.- It has reinforced holes to add a cable lock to keep the cover from being stolen.- The elastic cord or shock cord is substantial to the point you don't need any other strap downs to keep it in place, however in high winds Dowco recommends to strap it to the bike.- I installed it the first time in <60 seconds.- Removal would be equally quick.- The air vent is great as it will prevent moisture build up and potential mold and mildew.The Bad:- After 2 years of constant outside use here in Dallas (hot summers and rainy winter/spring) and under a tree the cover let me down.- It has faded to the point where is a single monochrome color (the warranty says this will happen).- A second one I purchased to replace it faded to single monochrome 6 months.- Several holes have worn through the material where it rubs on the bikes fenders (see picture).- The stitching in several areas especially around the shock cord is coming out in big clumps (see picture).- Along the bottom, big black spots of mold have taken hold.- The tag says it is not to be laundered,- I know now why that statement is made because if you do launder  (as it did in a washing machine) it will lose the water proofing material coating.- The stitching may be covered under warranty but youll have to pay shipping to them to find out.Conclusion:The cover does not wear well in weather.  Ill look for a different manufacturer or better quality cover to replace this one.

Basic mud flap, It's good for my CUV and makes a world of difference in the car, it no longer have the dirt stripes on the front doors or the rear bumper and at highway speeds at rain the cloud of mist behind the card it's a lot smaller.The installations depends of your car, in my case I trimmed a lot the front flaps but the rear where installed without modifications, I used a combination of original screw locations, plastic clips and some brackets, the mudflaps can be trimmed with a heavy duty or kitchen scissors.For what I paid these are some amazing mudflaps.

So far these look really good in my 02 Corvette, they are really bright.  The only "got cha" thing is you'll need to make sure you order the resistors as well, otherwise you'll have the hyper blink going on.  Resistors are only $7 from Amazon & easy to install.

The first one I ordered arrived with a broken light switch from shipping. The second one was rushed to me next day by amazon (excellent as always). It comes with the cover, a fused section of wire, a manual crank, and some washers that allow the jack to make good ground contact. It does not come with bolts but if you already have a bolted manual crank jack on your camper you should not need replacement bolts. Once I got it installed I wished I had ordered it sooner. The install only took 30 minutes and I took my sweet time. If one were to skip installing the fuse and zip tying the wire every 5 inches like I did you could do it in 5 minutes or less. Just remember to install it when you have it hitched up so you don't have to drag a car jack over to lift the tongue while you remove the old jack. The lights are adequate for the price (I paid around 65). This jack looks exactly like the Harbor Freight electric jack that cost $120. The foot has a pin so you can adjust the minimum height up and down. On the second peg of from the bottom of the foot I was able to get the bottom of my A-frame 19 inches off the ground. If you used another hole on the foot you could probably get it to 25 inches off the ground. I had no problem using this to jack up the rear of my F-150 and connect the weight distribution bars with ease. A great product. If it ever fails I WILL update this review.

Easy to apply. Instructions were clear. I used the images in this to assure myself of correct placement as the paper instruction provides no images. Only two alcohol swabs came in box and it said area should be wiped down after cleansing with the alcohol. I suggest you gave some on hand or supplier supplies enough to use on a 4 door truck. Same with adhesive sponge... just one included for entire job. I had to stretch that one. Hopefully it has no ill effect on the purpose of this purchase. The piece itself appears fairly durable and will withstand my kids sandy shoes and protect the paint. I cringe at any flaws so I'm trying my best to protect our investment.

Washed the Jeep yesterday and when I look at it today and I can see condensation on the inside of the lens.  Disappointing.  It did not take any "hard" water / direct hits from the garden hose.The lights still function but one can only guess for how long.I chose to not disassemble and reseal everything but I may be regretting that decision. Many others have recommended removing the cover and resealing all around the lens with marine clear caulk.I figured that with a 2 year warranty and at the cost I would give it a go.Suffice it to say these ar not KC or Rigids but they are 1/10th the cost.Glad I used quick disconnects on the wiring as I see a replacement in my future.

I replaced the stock courtesy light (driver's side floorboard area) and glovebox light in my Toyota Tundra with these LEDs.The lights are certainly brighter than the OEM lights and cast a pure-white light that matches the other LEDs (from a different manufacturer) that I'd previously installed in the cab area.I didn't test all six of the LEDs that I received but the two I used worked fine.The quality doesn't seem as good as some other LEDs I've purchased but a little better than a few others so I'd say they're average.They were shipped from Germany and took exactly two weeks to arrive. I'm probably spoiled by Amazon's fast deliveries, so it seemed like a very long time. They were loose in a small baggy wrapped in a sheet of bubble wrap inside of a soft plastic envelope (see picture). They could have been easily crushed but they all appeared to be undamaged.So far, so good. I'll report back with any updates.

I haven't experienced any of the issues everyone are reporting. Installation was simple, basically a single screw. My mount came with an adjustable cell phone mount. Holds my iPhone 6 and my girlfriend's iPhone 7plus very solidly, even while off-roading Jeep trails. I use this mount everyday to assist in navigation and traffic routing. Has hel up very well. Instructions for GoPro installation was not good, but a simple call to Manufacture provided all the info I needed. Hold GoPro very well and I have some amazing video of trails without blocking my view. You will need to purchase Amazon Basics GoPro tripod mount.

Can't really say much about this other than it works great. Really simple and does the job at protecting your doors and the doors of the car next to you. The door guards fit perfectly on my 2012 Ford F150 These stay on fairly well and don't use any adhesive. They are pliable enough to fit around any contours on door moulding but still soft enough to not mark up doors if you hit them. Simple yet effective and inexpensive. Good deal.

It took me a long time and a lot of research to finally come to the conclusion of buying this for my 07 Wrangler Unlimited X. I bought my jeep in 09 with 28k miles on it. It now has 160k on it and I have never had one problem with the engine. Over the years i have made upgrades of course, 2in lift, 35s, K&N intake, many body changes. About a year after I purchased the jeep I moved up to 33s with a leveling kit. Thats really the first time I started to feel the extra struggle in the engine. Once the 33s wore out I replaced the front end, put a 2in suspension lift on and went up to 35s. I loved the look but this time around my 3.8 felt like it was pulling 3500lbs behind it 24/7. So when I started hearing about the Superchips and the impact it could make for 300 bucks I began looking into it. Install was easy and it really has made a huge difference but not in the places i thought it would. This product is not about HP. If your looking for that go buy yourself new headers,  exaust, intake, and turbo, or even better then that drop a new engine in your Wrangler. What this product is for is getting back the giddy up of a stock Wrangler but with all bells and whistles you have added. It greatly improves the pedel timing, RPM and shift points. Not to mention fixing the speedo. I am extremely happy with my purchase.

I went with this over the Bump Shox Max because the top lip wouldnt look good with the front bumper of the 4Runner.Also being that the front of the 4Runner has only two screws holding the license plate I wanted something to hold the plate better thus the Plate Pocket.The license plate slides right into it. Installing is a breeze as it comes with extra long screws to for the bracket and the car. There are also flat ones that hold the cardboard cutout in which I used to secure the plate.

Item arrived quickly, although one corner was bent on arrival. The box was undamaged, so someone put a bent one in the box and shipped it to me. Not a biggle. simply bent it back and installed. Instructions call for a bunch of pre-drilling, which is totally unnecessary if you are using self tappers like almost everyone will be using ( not included )  Had to cut down the bottom faceplate in order to fit my needs, as well as make a bottom frame for the vent to grab into.  In all, it feels a little lightweight, and I'm sure I will be replacing the cover after a few desert seasons, but the crank works perfectly, I like the snap in screen, and it meets my needs.  Little more heavy duty would be nice, as well as including the installation hardware.

Great buy really brightens up my interior in 2013 Dodge Charger by a huge margin from stock plus they run much cooler and don't flicker like how my incandescent bulbs did. You'll need a mini flat head screw diver to get plastic lense cover off rear cab lights and to push bulb out. For Dome lights just pull at back of whole black housing and pull straight down working foward. Sounds like it gonna bust plastic but that's just the metal snaps that holds it up. Let it hang by wiring harness and just twist bulbs out push in led and twist back. Get polarity right b4 reinstalling housing it won't hurt bulb if you get it reversed. Warning they are bright so don't stare directly when turning on to check polarity. Gives car a very nice clean look ! !

These are great steps.  Installation was easy, although the back bolts took a little finesse to get in - simply because my hands were too big to fit back behind the steps to insert the washers and nuts.  The holes all lined up nicely and were oblong to allow for plenty of adjustment.  I installed the steps pushed back a little toward the rear simply because I found that was where I like to set my foot when I exit the jeep.  All of the hardware is included and is high quality.  The installation is basically installing 3 different sized brackets on each side into factory holes (no drilling required to put these on).  The upper part of the brackets bolt into the factory threaded holes from the factory.  The side of the bracket mounts into the factory holes on the pinch seem.  Then have a helper lift the step and place it on the brackets, 2 more bolts go through each bracket into the step and you're done.  Once installed they are super durable - no flex in the steps at all.  The cheesy "magnum" sticker peels right off and leaves no goo behind so you can just enjoy the beautiful powder coat finish.  These arrived well packaged with no damage.  I like these so much I'm now ordering a set for my ram 2500.

Amazing texture and thick enough for everyday rugged use. They fit my 2012 F150 4x4 like a glove. I would definitely purchase from this reputable company any day. Oh and don't worry about it coming or sliding off because they use an adhesive that is meant for abuse. I'm very happy to own a set that fits my lifestyle just right. I hope this helps anyone looking for a top notch product that can go the distance and work just as hard as you do.

I tried out the nano skins and I really liked them. So I ordered more,  box came in and I was stoked, until I opened it. I opened it and instantly I knew something was wrong.it was packaged weird, not bubble wrapped but stuff in a doubled up plastic bag. One of the gallon jugs didn't have a cap on it and everything in the bag were completely soaked in car shampoo. I really hope this doesnt happen to anyone else

I did not buy these from amazon but I did from JDM ASTAR's website. I hope to leave a review here though.These are good headlights! They definitely work and will compete with halogens for sure. They are bright, but they definitely will not compete with a good HID kit. Ill start with the good parts of these headlights.1. Quality: They have amazing build quality, the entire product is metal and comes with a huge fan less heat sink to keep the product cool under load. The connections are nice; very thick and have water proof connection, and the ballast are larger than usual LED kits but is built nice and strong. The product is built to last.2. Lighting: The lighting is definitely bright, after finding the ZES LED data sheet the 3500 Lumens seems to check out, I wouldn't say they are 4000 Lumens though. The Lumen lighting output for a ZES chip per watt (according to the data sheet) is 140lm/W which would equal 3500 Lumens. They definitely keep the road well lit though. I can see everything in front and on the sides perfectly. The light seems to disappear in bright city lights and rain like halogens. I have no issue seeing while using these. They will definitely keep the road and surroundings lit up.3. Lighting Color: Definitely matches up with 6500K, you definitely get a nice white with a definite blue glow to it. Amazing color for sure.4. Fan Less: Iv'e always used the LED kits with the fans, over time the fans get louder and more noticeable. Sometimes taking minutes to start up and not coming on causing the LED to shut off. So these are nice, Iv'e used them on hour long trips and longer and they have never gone out or flickered due to over heating. So i'm happy with the heat sink that's placed on these, it will keep them cool in any temperature.The Bad:1. Truly not 360 view able: These lights are advertised as 360 but they are not at all. I would say you get 260 at most so the headlight casing choice will be critical with these lights. My car has projector headlights so the light spreads out pretty evenly but bottom center loses light due to light not reaching those areas well. The ZES data sheet sais the LED gives off 120 degree viewing angle so really the lights seem to have a 240 degree viewing angle and not 360. Light will definitely be lost in certain spots with these lights. That is a problem with all double sided LEDs though. Adding a 3rd light would be the cure for this. These lights definitely get over taken by brighter HIDs and bright city lights on the road. They still keep light on the road though.2. Larger Ballast: This isn't an issue for build quality though, it just makes these harder to be installed in smaller spaces. My car has a dust cover to keep the projector area safe, thankfully i was able to fit the ballast and light inside and put the cover back on. Cars with smaller dust cover areas are going to have to keep the cover off though.The Pros definitely out weight the Cons for sure. These are good headlights and will compete with halogens keeping the road well lit. They run quiet and bright and I will keep using them for sure. They could be improved with another face for a chip with LED's to make the true 360 Angle. If they had that 3rd side they would definitely compete with HID kits and put out more than 4000 Lumens. 9th gen guys??? hahaIm defintely happy with my purchase.

Nice liners and very elegant look.  I gave them 4 stars because these ones are not strong enough.  My driver liner is starting to break where my right toe rest close to the brake pedal.  Husky should think on using a thicker rubber specifically with this one, or, at least, adding an extra reinforcement on the area.

Great for at the beach. The constant in and out of the water,  along with sand, makes for quite a dirty mess. This is Matt shakes off quickly, and does not absorb the water. must-have for any parent who loves to go out to the beach, but does not like the hassle of heavy wet blankets.

This funnel is MUCH nicer than what the photo shows. The entire bottom portion is entirely made out of heavy, thick, anodized billet aluminum. The photo just doesn't do this thing justice. This funnel really is worth the money if you are a professional Toyota/Lexus tech. I wish I had this funnel years ago, it would have save a lot of spilled oil, not to mention time saved. You can pour the oil in as fast as you want, it will NOT spill because of the perfect seal at the valve cover. Even though it seems like a lot of money for just a funnel, if you are a Toyota/Lexus tech, get it. It is very high quality and you won't regret it.

This water container is NOT made from "HDPE" as the description claims.I purchased this water container because it's made with thick, sturdy plastic and the description claimed the material was "HDPE" (High density polyethylene).  HDPE is considered safer because it's not supposed to leech BPA (Bisphenol-A which is a known endocrine disruptor).  When the container arrived, I looked on the bottom to see what the recycle code was.  Instead of a recycle code of "2-HDPE" it has "7-Other".  Typically number 7 plastics are polycarbonate, which are known for leeching BPA into drinking water.Buyer beware.

I had one bad lower ball joint on my 350,000 mile 2001 Toyota RAV-4 causing my car to wobble on the highway like my grandmother after her fourth glass of wine, only without all the racist rants about minorities and the "problems with kids these days."Removal of the old part can be extremely difficult and is known to be a right to manhood in certain tribes.  Here's a hint: take the hub partially off the car (remove the strut mount), push the axle out (there's a tool for this), then push the axle off to the side.  Loosely reconnect the hub to the strut and you now have room to get a huge cheater bar and a 19mm socket on that old ball joint and crank it like a teenage boy.  It might take a ton of torque, especially if your cotter pin was as rusted into the threads as mine was.  There's a tie rod puller tool called the GearWrench 3916D that will make popping that old ball joint out of its hole crazy easy.  Use it.This new ACDelco part was better than expected.  It doesn't look like the part in the pictures (no nice brass nuts or grease zerk), but they built it nicely in a couple of key aspects.  The main castle nut on the top is beefier than the original, being a straight 22mm nut instead of a 19mm flared nut, and the rubber boot looks to be thicker than the old one.  It went together without a hitch.  Only the test of time will really tell if this is truly a quality part.

About six months ago, I purchased a DBPower unit (which had great Amazon reviews) and which is identical to this MoKo. I have used the DBPower 3 times... once on my wife's car...once out on the lake when a battery in my boat failed to start because we had been running our sound system when the boat was anchored with the engine off. In both cases the DBPower fired up the engine, on the first turn of the ignition switch...and interestingly, once when a stranger needed a jump start. I have to say they were quite surprised when I pulled this out and without using my car, jump started them from the "little black box". They reacted as if I were from Mars, expressing supreme surprise, and asking where I got this.So, having multiple vehicles and thinking about getting at least one more DBPower, when this MoKo showed up in my Vine queue of items I can select from, to receive and review, I jumped without hesitation, because this is absolutely identical to my DBPower and is unquestionably made by the same manufacturer, (obviously private labeling for brands who want this product in their lineup). When I received this, I pulled out my DBPower version to compare and everything is absolutely identical...the power box itself, the buttons and controls, the form factor and exterior shell, and all of the accessories, which come neatly compartmentalized within a rugged carrying case, which is also identical to the DBPower, except for a change in color of the case and logo (see attached pictures). Both come with clear use instructions. So based on my knowledge of the product itself and how it actually performed for me on 3 occasions, I absolutely recommend this product, without question. And here are my observations.I am totally amazed that such a small package can do what it does. Jump starts my Ford F-150 with 5.4L engine and my power boat which has a 5.7L big block Chevy as its power source. I wanted to test the real capability of this little jewel, so I disconnected the battery on the truck and then connected this to the truck's cables that normally go on the battery posts, to see what it could do. Fired right up. Next I disconnected the dual battery setup on my boat and did the same thing.I am dumbfounded that you can recharge this thing through a USB cable. Oh, well. Not my place to understand what goes into the technology of this thing, but it is wonderful to have the piece of mind that it can get you out of trouble when no one else is around to give you a jump start. And, I can carry it in my glove compartment (without the case) or in the trunk (with case and all accessories). Excellent to say the least. There are 3 ways to charge it. 1) Direct connection to a wall outlet without using the USB. (2) Plug into any USB charging port, just like you do for your smartphone. (3) Plug it into your cigarette lighter/accessory plug without USB or with a USB to cigarette lighter connection.  Odd that something that packs such a wallop is charged in these options. It is great that you can actually charge it while you are driving, if for instance it was low on charge and you were driving a distance and wanted to be sure that it got charged up, while you were driving in case your battery went dead. In this instance the alternator on your car is doing the charging of the device, plugged into your cigarette lighter, while you are driving.The device has indicator lights on it to let you know how much charge is left in it (as a percentage of "juice" left). So you have some fair warning if it is getting low on charge.I can't speak to its longevity since I just got it, and I have no idea as to whether it can perform multiple charges before needing to be recharged (as claimed by the manufacturer), which says you can go through up to 20 vehicle charges before the unit has to be recharged. So you basically want to keep abreast of the battery "charge left" status.This charger would be critical if you are out in the wilderness, tent camping, hiking, or off-roading without anyone around to give you a jump start....no problem. And it has an LED flashlight on the end of it, for night time assistance, to see what you are doing in the dark (maybe hooking it up to your battery posts with the included cables).An added benefit is that you can recharge cell phones and other devices without needing to be near a power outlet.I am going to put one of these in my wife's car, as well as my truck.

I've always been impressed with Meguiar's cleaning products, and the Gold Class Car Wash lives up to their reputation.  The car shampoo creates a great sudsy bucket and cleans the car very well without removing the existing wax.  The last thing you want to do is use a car soap that strips the wax from your vehicle.  After washing the car and rinsing the soap, I use a high powered blower to dry my vehicle.  Since the Gold Class doesn't remove the wax, the water easily blows off the car and I only need to use a microfiber cloth to remove any small amount of excess water.  No streaks, no swirls.  Likewise, you don't need to use too much of the soap (a bit more than a capful) for a great sudsy bucket.Like many Amazon shoppers, I count on honest, unbiased reviews to make my purchase decisions.  I hope you found this review helpful.

Perfect hitch receiver for the DIY guy or gal.  Solid construction with quality materials and flawless fit!  Im very pleased with how easy it was to install.After removing the rear tie down hook...  Grabbed a floor jack, raised the center of the hitch receiver up toward the rear bumper, lifted one end of the hitch receiver to align it with the existing holes on the frame, and carefully installed the bolts on each side.  Torqued the bolts to recommended specs and installation was complete!  Start to finish was less than 30 minutes!Purchased this kit with a Tyger hitch armor accessory.  Perfect fit!

This is an excellent product that comes in very handy when your automobile won't start. No longer will you need a second vehicle to boost your car/truck. Its compact size makes it easy to pack along for some RZR/SxS riding or stow in the car until a time of needed. It also doubles as a charging device for those electronic devices!

Great little net. This was my second purchase of this netting (one for me and now one for my wife). I use them as lids for a milk crate. The milk crate is used for storage in the back of my kayak. The netting has nice small square holes that help keep everything inside the milk crate if I flip my kayak. It's absolutely perfect for my use.

Amazingly, you cannot find these at local Autoparts stores...at least we can't where I live and they will not even order them.  Thankfully, Amazon had them.  We used them on the upper intake manifold of my son's 2001 Ford Taurus with the DOHC V6 when he dropped one of the original ones down into the engine compartment (not into the engine itself) and we could not find it.  They are specified for use in the Windstar on many sites and even on Amazon it states they will not fit the Taurus (see picture).  They fit perfectly though they look a little different.  The rubber part is green vs black of the OEM and the bolt is a white metal vs brass of the OEM, but they worked!Hope this was helpful.  If it was, feel free to click the Helpful button below!

Set up two of these (one constant hot and the other tied to the ignition switch with a relay) and a bus bar for ground to avoid having multiple fuse taps on the main fuse box of my F-350. Turned out even better than I anticipated. Good little unit for the money. I must give credit where due. I saw this type of set up on a YouTube video by klowny1969 titled "how to wire a switched fuse block from scratch".  Highly recommended, very detailed and successful if you just follow the directions and this product fit perfectly.

I have a Subaru Crosstrek with a hitch-mount two station bike rack. There are many times I will have two bikes (one of them a fatbike) mounted. The reverse lights on the Crosstrek are dim at best, and that is without having the bikes. When I do have bikes mounted, especially the fatbike, the reverse lights are almost non-existent, and becomes quite a challenge when backing into dark camp spots. One particular situation was when I arrived at a camp spot late one evening carrying two bikes, and I could not see anything when backing into the spot (I always have to back in). All I could see in the backup camera is the bikes light up when I hit the brakes, nothing else.These bulbs were recommended from a Subaru Facebook group. I decided to give these a shot. When the package arrived, I immediately opened the box, removed the bulbs from the ESD packaging, and inspected the bulbs, and was impressed with the appearance of the bulbs. The PCBs are of robust design, the solder joints appeared consistent and clean, LED arrays were even, etc. These appeared to be of quality manufacture.The install took less than a minute on each side. They plugged into the socket, paying close attention to the retention of the bulbs into the socket. I've read some reviews that had issues with the bulbs being too loose in the socket and falling out. After a few insertions and removals in each socket, the bulbs still required no less removal force than the stock bulbs.Once everything was assembled, I turned the key and dropped the shifter into reverse. The difference in brightness was huge! The bulbs had no issue lighting up the driveway, and the house across the street! I tried to include before and after photos, but unfortunately the camera (or my abilities) could not capture the lighting improvement. After a week, I was able to experience the new bulbs with the bike rack with two bikes mounted to the car, and there is still more than enough light to see clearly when reversing, even with the fat tire bike on the rack!Bottom line, I am very happy with the fit and performance of the bulbs. Time will tell if these will last. I will update my review if anything changes.

Not bad. It is slim so the tank needs refilling more often, which should just go to say. The paint was ok until I let it set over night on a moist paper towel. I would advise against that unless you want to remove the paint.

This is the first paste wax I've ever used, and I find it to be much easier to use than #845. After washing and claying my car, and trying a few test spots, I applied this by hand to the entire vehicle and let it cure for about 10 minutes. It came off with incredible ease and left behind a stunning glossy look that I thought couldn't be achieved with a white car! It seems to fill in light swirls/scratches.Once I finished buffing off most of the wax, some had managed to dry completely. Instead of buffing your arm off, just apply a little more wax onto the dry area and it'll wipe off without any issues. I prefer 915 over 845 since it doesn't seem as "greasy/oily" when trying to buff off areas where too much wax was applied. 915 also smells very pleasant in comparison to 845, a light coconut smell that gets stuck in your nose well after you're done waxing your car. Much better than the Raid spray scent that 845 has!Despite 915 being marketed towards darker colored vehicles, I think it does a fantastic job on light ones as well! You will not be disappointed with this wax, it makes waxing a breeze!

I haven't tried other brands yet, but after using Duratrax I'm pretty much going to have it as my go to paint because of its very nice visual quality and quick drying time making total paint time less time consuming when painting multiple coats.  I've found using a hair blow dryer between coats helps speed up the drying process as well.  I will be buying more.

Pretty neat window shades. I've been looking for something like this for quite some time now. When I received them, they also came with adhesive backed tabs that you can also use to attach these to your headliner.But I'm skeptical about the long term durability of this method of installation since the eventual repetitive pulling could end up failing / pulling off. I'm also not a huge fan of clipping these directly to the window glass since it also slightly impedes the ability to fully roll the windows shut.So sitting in the back seat of the car (where I intended these to go) I realized something. Pretty much every car I've ever been in has these "assist grips" - built in handles in the upper aspect of each car door, presumably to aid people in getting in and out of the car. These are probably most useful for elderly passengers or maybe those who have aches / pains / musculoskeletal injuries.  To be honest I've never used them.... So I decided to mount these in place of those handles. Please note that this method of installation probably will not work for everyone, but I thought it might be a useful alternative that some of you might want to imitate. Each car design is likely to be just a bit different also, so keep that in mind.First off, I used a flat head screwdriver to pop open the end covers.  This exposes the anchor screws. Next I unscrewed and removed the "assist grips". Then I re-screwed in the Philips head screws but left enough of a gap for the shade clips to slide on.  This may take a little bit of trial and error to get snug. Finally I slid the shades onto the screw heads and voil!!  I can be pretty sure that they are now securely fastened, as the anchor screws are directly bolted into the car frame.I attached the Velcro adhesive anchor to the bottom window frame as originally instructed. I think I may eventually replace this too - probably will think about using a couple of tiny rare earth magnets - one epoxied to the bottom of the curtain and the other epoxied to the inside of the door edge.Anyway, hope this helps. I'm planning on enjoying these shades for the next few years....

Ordered two sets of these to fabricate a low front deck light system for my kayak for night fishing and bowfishing, running the 2 lights each from a single, 7aH deep cycle AGM battery from an uninterruptible power supply. I checked here, AliExpress, and Ebay before ordering here with the best price.While the pictures don't do great justice because the iPhone camera really doesn't like dark backgrounds with bright light in the foreground, these lights are awesome. I was illuminating all the vertical supports of a large bridge at once with these while catfishing the Rappahannock, much to my surprise. I expected burn time to be around 2 hours (I expected the power draw rating to be inaccurate), but was quite surprised that after 5, the lights were still going strong from the small 7Ah battery.The bracket can be a little janky but it locks down nicely. The fact that it separates entirely from the light makes permanent mounting easy. I will probably buy the same light in "spot" for the front center of my boat to give me a little more throw, but all in all I'm absolutely thrilled with these lights.

Replaced my OEM HID bulbs in my 2013 Maxima SV with these and let me tell you, they are absolutely brighter. Was unsure at first how even a marginally higher kelvin rating could produce greater light efficacy without compromising ballast wattage but, these bulbs are the real thing. The periphery of the light spectrum is also expanded, perfectly. Serious technology here people. These bulbs are five stars.

Search the following words in the YouTube application or on Google. "How to install a cabin air filter on a Subaru Legacy" by the DIY guy in the picture I also included in my review.

Not sure why some are grumbling, I am loving this thing. Mine came with metal hooks with plastic no scratch caps, they seem quite strong. I am using the net on my BMW F650 stretched from pannier to pannier, for that it works great and holds my book bag quite well. I would say this would be much too large to be of much use on a bike without panniers, it is more the size of a quad rack.So if you have a need for a large stretching net, this one is the one, if you need a small one, look for another.

I used this bulb to replace the dim, low color temperature (~2,500K) bulb in the glovebox of my 2001 Mercedes SLK230. The new light is MUCH brighter, and whiter. Assuming the bulb holds up, I'll be eternally happy.

STAY AWAY FROM THESE. GIVEN THE TERRIBLE QUALITY AND SUB-PAR CUSTOMER SERVICE YOU ARE BETTER SPENDING YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE.I've been using these boot covers for nearly a year now and I have two main issues with them:1. They are of marginal quality. After just a few times of wearing them the elastic band under the heel on one of the covers came loose and was dangling. I cut it off for fear of it getting tangled on something on the bike. I do notice that the cover catches the wind more now that it is missing. More importantly though, after less than a year of use, the boot covers began to tear at the seam that holds the velcro. This issue leads me to my next problem.2. Nelson-Rigg customer service is a pathetic joke. I called when the elastic band broke on the bottom of the cover and they asked that I send them back to be inspected. Given Houston winters can be wet I asked if it would be possible to send a replacement in advance so I was not without boot covers. They kindly would do so but I'd be charged a fee in order to get an advanced pair. Keep in mind their idea of an advanced pair is I buy them online directly from them and when they decide to replace the defective pair they would refund the money (minus their 5% fee of course).The same issue occurred when I called about obtaining a warranty replacement after the seems started splitting. I would need to send in the covers for them to inspect them before they would replace them. If I wanted an advanced pair to use in the interim, I had to fork over the costs (which is fine by me) but once they decided to replace them, they would charge me a fee and refund the purchase.STAY AWAY FROM THESE. GIVEN THE TERRIBLE QUALITY AND SUB-PAR CUSTOMER SERVICE YOU ARE BETTER SPENDING YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE.

I purchased the Chemical Guys (CG) Leather Cleaner to use in conjunction with "Leather Rescue Conditioner" for the leather in my 2013 Acura MDX.  The powerful Florida sun and trips to the beach can do a number on the leather interior of cars, especially those with black leather.  Although Acura use a special protection on the leather to minimize stains, the leather is still subject to getting dirty and to fading.  I purchased the CG Leather Cleaner and leather rescue conditioner for three reasons:1.) It works on "sealed" leather"2.) The product had 100s of positive reviews3.) It's a great price compared to other cleaners and conditionersLike others have stated in their reviews, the key to proper results is to apply the product in STEPS.1.) Clean your leather with the CG Leather Cleaner using a clean microfiber cloth. Spray on the cloth to avoid overspray.2.) Let the leather dry from the cleaning before applying any of the leather rescue conditioner3.) Apply the leather conditioner using a different cloth than what you used to clean it.  Apply sparingly; a little goes a long way. You don't need to rub it into the leather; apply enough that the leather begins to shine.4.) Leave what you applied to leather on the surfaces for at least an hour.  This will allow the leather to absorb the conditioning oils.5.) After an hour, wipe up any excess oils using a third microfiber towel.Overall, I'm VERY pleased with the results.  The CG Leather Cleaner did an amazing job to clean the surface of the leather and the Leather Rescue has brought back my 4+ year-old leather to like new.  The seats are not slippery or shinny; they have a deep, dark color to them again.  Look at the pictures below and you can see how the center console leather now has a deep, rich, dark black color.

Great price and quick delivery. I'm not sure why the instruction sheet was folded four times then stuffed under the O-ring and then vacuum sealed. Fortunately the O-ring (although stretched) still fit properly in the O-ring groove.  Taking away one star due to the way it was packaged.

Potential customers of this LED .. please be advise that the LED's I received are 4 wide and 3 deep NOT 3 wide and 4 deep as shown on the misleading Amazon page. This means you need even "more" unused space to each side of your current bayonet bulb's centerline in order for the CuteQueen to fit. I was only able to (barely) fit them into the main dome fixture but not the rear one on my 4Runner. You may be able to carefully 'bend' your fixture's metal mounting contacts, if you have a corner obstruction.Don't forget to reverse the direction if yours don't light up .. they ARE polarity sensitive. They are somewhat brighter than the factory bulbs, though also slightly more directional. Light output may be just slightly brighter than the factory Toshiba incandescents but current color variation (yellow for the factory bulb and bluish white for the LED's is somewhat bizarre. I will keep searching for an actual 3-wide festoon.Shipping me a different item than pictured and making me jump through the hoops to return it, is a critical error in my book, but, hopefully, explains my 1 Star rating. I have emailed and phoned Amazon about the image discrepancy, though my impression was it's not a priority issue for them.

The exhaust construction is great and the package arrived with no damage. If you are looking for a loud exhaust, this is not it. It changed the exhaust note and gave it a good rumble. It sounds good at idle and at wide open throttle. If you are looking for a good quality performance muffler to replace the stock muffler, than this is a great choice!

Love the look and the fitment is perfect, it was also really easy to install. Can notice a little difference in sound, but don't know if I picked up any increase in fuel mileage yet because I just installed last weekend and haven't needed to fill up yet. Plus I am still doing upgrades on the truck too, exhaust will be next.

I don't think it is worth over $200.  I use my 1st one to pull shrubs out of yards and am getting more and more ambitious on the size of bush I want to pull.  The one wench red lines and I am afraid of ruining it.  So, here I am; BUT, geez these things are tooooo pricey now.  Where's the china alternative?Well, I bought the second and pulled a huge pine tree root ball.i wanted to give it 5 stars, since the secon one seems to have a overload cut out timer...CRAP!  Bought the second and now I have two BROKEN ones.  Examined the guts and man am i disappointed.  Too frustrated to type about it....for now, more later.....  this buggers at least can hang out of the way as reminders of bad engineering.Yep, just saw it in my box of broken dreams, what a shame, the wasted money on these POS...live and learn...I have the parts for two of them, and would like to offer an option for other broken ones to be sent for further study of a claim of faulty product.  So, have fun with the new one, and when it breaks, let me know and we will go from there....years later still troubles me , what a POS, one day I will just throw the thing away

I love this little net, bought for my F800 GT.  Really gives me convenience to leave empty and return with items, or just make sure what I am carrying stays put.  I use it to add security to the simple fanny pack I use that holds a few tools, a flat kit, my phone and battery pack, and any other things I happen to need or acquire.  So far it has handled multiple trips and various attachment configurations, and it has held up well.  I'm very pleased with the item, so much so we subsequently bought the large nets, for the longer trips and carrying convenience.  Works for us!

These are so much brighter than the stock equivalent. The only concern I have is that they seemed to fit much looser than the standard bulb so I'll be watching them to make sure they don't rattle loose over time. The 4 stars is due to fitting loosely.

Great kit that gives you the aesthetic look you're going for without the expense of a full suspension rebuild.Install on a 2006 4 Runner varies depending on what setup you have. The instructions that are included with the kit are VERY rudimentary. There are plenty of tutorials and walk-throughs online to follow. Check to see if you have the X-Reas suspension prior to beginning work. If you don't have X-Reas, it's dramatically simpler to install this kit as you can remove all the suspension components.

This was a great buy.  I was a little worried that this would impact my vehicles reception (AM, FM, OnStar, etc) but i am pleased to say I have had no issues at all.  With reception issues aside, it looks fantastic compared to the stock fishing pole look.  It's much shorter, and just all around better looking.  No tools at all needed.  I opened my rear door, stood on the side step and unscrewed the old one with my hand and screwed on the new stubby jr.  Whole process took maybe 30 seconds.  If you're considering this I'd say go for it.  It's well worth the $25.

I installed this on my 2006 Xterra and am sad about the quality of the gasket.  I did the radiator bypass for the transmission.  My Xterra has about 80k miles on it, so I thought now is a good time to replace the filter and fluid.  Doing this job, I used about 5 quarts of transmission fluid.The correct torque spec for the oil pan bolts is 70 inch-lbs.  I verified this by using a dial-type torque wrench when I removed the bolts.The crappy gasket as others have mentioned, gets pushed out as you are slowly  torquing down the bolts.  I was only able to torque each bolt down to 30 inch lbs and the gasket was already bulging out!!  That's not even half of the factory torque spec.  I sure hope the fluid does not leak!******************************************************************************************************************************************************Day after the installation:Required a tow from my wife's working place to home so I can repair it.  The entire contents of the automatic transmission leaked out from one of the "bulges" in the gasket.  Luckily I noticed the leak after she left for work and decided to refill the transmission during her lunch break.  The leak was too big to drive home.  The entire under carriage is coated in automatic transmission fluid.  And this is not cheap fluid.  I used Matic-S compatible fluid at $8/quart.  I am dropping my review from 3 stars down to 1 star.  If I could give it zero stars, I would.I will order a Nissan OEM gasket.  Hope there is no damage to the transmission from the lack of fluid.

Edit: it's been on my truck for almost 2 years, and looks as good as the day I put it on. I assumed it'd weather, fade, and peel. Multiple car washes and road grime haven't made a difference!!I expected it to be thicker and domed like the original ford badges, which it definitely is not. Once I got the original off, and spent a LOT of time removing the original adhesive, it stuck flat against the tailgate and looked good.I just put it on, so I can't speak to its durability. If it falls off like one of the other review states, I'll update and lower my star rating.

This is a good light bar.  I chose this one specifically because of the post mounting brackets instead of the ones that have mounting brackets on the end caps.I took off a star because of the poor gasket around the lens.  I've read reviews on dozens of LED light bars with a similar construction and they all consistently have reviews complaining of them quickly getting water behind the lens and getting ruined.  Others have recommended siliconing all around the lens.The photo shows the gasket behind the plastic lens only goes about 90% of the way, on each side and top/bottom.  This is baffling to me, why these manufactures thought this was a good idea and why they haven't changed things after so many bad reviews.  With any of these light bars, force some silicon all around the edges of the lenses or you most certainly will have a ruined light bar.

A Whole lot more air flow... The backing plate and the filter itself make it clear that the bike will breath MUCH better. Mine is on a 2015 SGS. Install was very easy. I wanted a stage 1 intake that I could use the stock 2015 103 intake cover, and this one was an option. I also do have the fp3. The only two problems I found are: 1) the three holes on the filter did not quite line up with the three holes on the back plate. I had to drill out the bottom hole on the filter just a hair; and  2) the stock air cover doesn't conceal the throttle body all the way. You can see what i mean in the pics. Before buying this one, I looked for pics like this a lot, so if you are too, here you go.

These lamps look good on a bar, but I mounted them in my lower bumper. They aren't bright, but the glass lens allowed for easy conversion to HID's. If you have a need for extra light (I use mine to light up work areas) then these will do the job, just expect to do some bulb upgrade if you actually want to see anything.

I just purchased this Viair based on reviews and reviewing the company's website, along with a good solid 3 days of reviewing many compressors. The reviews on Amazon helped make my decision.  I live chatted with Viair online and they are very responsive.  First off, as I know someone probably has a headache from trying to make choices and wondering which model for what tire.  The 88P model is ideal for tires up to 31" (up to the larger tires seen on trucks, off road, etc.).  The lower models numbers like the 85 or 87 are for cars, minivans and the like.  Now, if you want up to 31" allowance because you might have a trailer, ATV, then by all means, go for the 88 or 89 models; they are all the same size units.  88P and up have the battery connectors vs. cig lighter plug in. Yet, I've read you can get the cig lighter / 120V cig outlet adapter for this model.  It seems very sturdy and I tried it out on my Truck with 265/70R17 size tires.  No issues.  If you see my other reviews, I bought a small military bag here on Amazon to go with it. Fits great with room for the long hose and power cord. Here's the link to the bag on Amazonhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0143JZZWG?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00  I also purchased the Tekton 5941 Digital Tire Gauge here on Amazon.  It matched the gauge on the dial gauge of the compressor when I tried them.  So, I would recommend the Viair. Great size, portable and durable.

This trunk organizer makes life so much easier when grocery shopping. I don't have to worry about my groceries rolling all over the place. It has 3 compartments that can be changed into 2. You can use the clips on the side to close one side and minimize it into one compartment. I has pockets made out of netting on both long sides of the organizer. also has a blue pocket on one side. It folds up easily and easy to store. It has 2 bottom pieces that you can pull out easily to minimize the organizer. It has sturdy handles so you can carry your groceries or anything in it. I also have used it to keep my children travel items in it so they can have their stuff organized and easy to get to when going on long trips. I would recommend these to anyone looking to have a good way to organize item in their car.DISCLAIMER: I received this as a promotion in exchange for a honest non bias review

These bulbs are absolutely awesome!!! They are ridiculously bright and perfect clean white. They look unbelievable in my 2012 Mazda 6. I used them for my fog lights, you can see how great they look by checking out the pictures I included. They give the front end of the car a much more aggressive and finished look. The quality of the bulbs are very high and built incredibly solid. They came packed in an anti-static bag inside a nice black box with foam lining. Very impressed with these and the company. I would 100% recommend purchasing these.Please be advised I received this item at a discounted cost in exchange for an honest review.

We really like this tire inflator. It is built really well, is sturdy and has an easy-to-read display. I received the EPAuto Digital Tire Inflator at no cost in order to review and it is durable and handy. It comes disassembles so you do have to take a few moments to put a few parts on but it's not difficult. It even includes a set of batteries to power the digital display.The batteries install in a compartment the is accessed by slipping the rubber cover off the round face. The rubber cover easily slips off and back on. It has a lip that slips over the edge of the face so it satys in place. The red flexible hose screws into the hole at the top, above the trigger handle. The chuck is the straight lock-on style and it screws into the hole on the bottom of the black handle. You do need to tighten these down with a wrench to prevent air leakage. On the chuck, it is even better to use a litle teflon tape to help get a full seal.I got this for my husband since he is the one that usually does the car and machine maintainance around here, but I used this so I'd know how it works and be ale to use it if he wasn't here. I have since used it a few times and have gotten much more comfortable with it! The first time I used it I thought it was defective because there was all kinds of air escaping out around the handle. Then I realized you have to really push the nozzle onto the valve stem. Once I readjusted that and made sure it was on the valve stem good, there was no air flow around the handle and it worked perfectly.This inflator allows you to inflate as well as deflate if needed. By fully pressing (pulling?) the tigger, you can inflate the tire. If you need to let a little out, only press the trigger halfway down. Turn on the digital display and you as you inflate you can see the pressure you have going in. After inflating or deflating, you can releas the trigger and the and the PSI will be displayed on the digital readout to let you know if you have enough or need more. It has worked great on our vehicle tires and lawn mower tires. The only thing we had trouble using it on, was a little Honda 50cc motorcycle, only because it wouldn't fit the valves well enough to get the airtight seal.My husband has gotten to use this a few times now and he too likes it. While it is not a fully metal inflator, he is still impressed with the functionality and ease of use. This unit has a heavy duty feel and the display is easy to read. Since we won't be leaving it laying around in the yard and exposed to weather, I expect it to remain in good working order and to last a long time. This is a good tool to have  for the handy, do-it-yourself person that works on and maintains their own vehicles and machines.

I've always used JDM ASTAR bulbs in my vehicles. The quality has mostly been top knotch. However, I just blew $30 per pair of these bulbs to have one dead on arrival, three of four banks inop around the side of it, and none of these stay in my sockets. They pop right out. They're not secure. These also rattle like there's loose components when they're gently shaken by hand. What is this JDM ASTAR? Letting us long time loyal buyers down? I've always passed good recommended word about you as top of the line in quality to everyone I knew. But I'm seeing a decline here....

2012 Sienna LE, fit perfectly, the online video definitely helped me. Mine were also aimed very low, but not hard to adjust as described. One star off because the relay failed after maybe a dozen uses. The black debris in the photo was inside the housing, and you can see the burnt contacts. I found the replacement on eBay, Song Chuan 804-1A-C1 12VDC, or brand Shori or YKS S11-1A-C1-12VDC.  So be sure to position the relay and fuse where you can get at them for replacement.

I "think" these things work because you will never know how many deer you didn't hit with your car. But, I do know that since I started using deer whistles over 25 years ago, I have hit less deer that I did before I started using them. I usually buy the two piece set, but this model fits better on our BMW Z4. This is a nice low profile, easily mounted device. I've used this model before and didn't hit any deer with that vehicle. Either its the luck of the draw or they really work. Regardless; for under $10, it's cheap insurance, plus you are helping an American company because these are Made in USA. The ones made in China may only scare Chinese deer, so why risk it, buy American! You be the judge, but I will continue to use them as a deterrent against running into deer on my daily drives.

We contacted the company to ask if we could get it in black. They responded quickly with instructions on how to get it in black. We placed the order and received the add-a-wall quicker  than expected. We are very happy with this purchase!  My husband is handy so it was fairly easy for us to install in about an hour or so.

Freaking awesome! its 3 different strips but very easy to apply and looks wonderful. Have purchased it multiple times and hasn't failed me yet, fairly easy to apply when taking your time and using a vinyl application liquid.

I'm using this plug cover with a Kats engine block heater.  At first I was a little disappointed because this thing doesn't cover the whole plug.  It just sort of snaps onto the very end of the plug where the 3 prongs are.  But after using it for a month or so, it's working great and I have no complaints.  The plug for my block heater comes out near the bottom of the grill on my car...so it hangs out in the breeze as I'm rolling down the road at 65mph every day (see my picture).  This little cap fits on tight enough that it NEVER blows off...but it's also fairly easy to install/remove.  I'm satisfied with it.

They work great, however they arrived banged up and i had to get some black undercarriage paint and touch them up.  Not a big deal, i just didn't need the extra work and cost of spray paint.  Thats why i gave 4 out of 5 stars.  Maybe yours will arrive in good condition, however be aware you may need touch them up with some black paint.

Works great as an easy mount to use on your mirrors. Put this in and securely mounts my gps in the right orientation.  I got two, I've for each side of the bike. One for a drink holder and the second. Fits great just buy this and you'll have solid mounting points for your gear.

Looked alright for a few weeks but like others have stated it does fade and start to look unattractive.EDIT:Have had this hook since February and since then it's gone from a shiney red to an ugly dull orange. Save the $10 and go buy yourself a nice car wash because a shiney car looks much better than this crap.

I just bought my 99 TJ and noticed that the 3rd brake light was not there and in NYS you have to have one on your ride if it was built after 80 something to pass inspection,  I looked around for an aftermarket replacement but was not happy with the looks of them and I found used stock replacements on craigslist but would still have to buy an extention to clear my 33 inch sparetire, so I gave a chance on this kit, and I have to say that I am very happy I did, The wiring and connectors are of great quality, the lights are very bright, and they give you plenty of wiring to get the job done,The install is pretty easy and quick maybe 20 min, I took longer because I wanted it to look clean so I removed the grommet that is in the tailgate, took an Exacto knife and carefully made the center of the grommet bigger to run all 4 wires through, then I soldered it to the stock door connector pins, so the install prob took me more than hour but looks fantastic and clean. The lights fit in my American racing ATZ series tire fine,40 bucks may seem steep for 2 lights and some wire but it is the cheapest option if you don't have a 3rd brake light and at least they do send you quality hardware.Very happy and would buy again for future jeeps with no hesitations...Update 07/11/2016.. Lights are holding up fantastic, I get complements all the time and passed NYS inspection without a problem.. still very pleased

I really liked the understated JEEP logo.  You see it but it is not all you see because it is to bright.  The material is really strong. There is not draw tie to secure it but it seems to be on tight.  I have never seen a tire cover laying on the street side, so I assume this design does not come off as you head down the road. If anyone knows if there are any drawbacks to keeping a tire covered to long, please let me know.One month later follow up....I was having dinner with my family in Red Robin in Middle TN in broad daylight.  When we came back out, someone had taken a knife to cut my tire cover and done it so aggressively they even cut into my allow wheel.  Has this happened to anyone else?

Bought these strictly for cosmetics for my 2013 Ford Expedition. Trying to distinguish a bit from every other Expedition on the road. I like the look a lot. A little tricky installing as you need to make sure you have it lined up right before pulling the tape. I recommend searching for an install video just to get an idea. Easy to clean. Good solid product. No complaints.

These are awesome. So much better than stock.  They were a bit of a pita to install though due to limited access to the lower nut on the passenger side of my 2012 JK.Had to remove the are filter and drop the power steering reservoir just to get bare minimum access to said nut.  This of course is a Jeep engineering issue not an RR issue.

I own two 2009 Porsche Cayennes, and having spent $1544 at the stealership to replace a driveshaft in one of them only 6 months ago, I was not looking forward to making this costly repair again; at least not this soon after the other.  The stealership told me the driveshaft in my wife's vehicle was bad and needed to be replaced.  They did not offer any alternative.  The thumping in the area of the center console was very bad and the vehicle was not driveable, so I went ahead and had the repairs made.  With the new driveshaft installed, the vehicle drove well; noise gone, so while a lot of money, I was happy to pay it, until I came across the EPS drive shaft bearing support mount.At $399, for a permanent solution to the common cardan shaft problem that Cayenne's and Touareg's seem to have, the EPS mount looked like a good option, so I ordered one for my Cayenne.  The part arrived quickly with Amazon Prime.  I was surprised a flex disc was included because, although shown in the product description on the Amazon.com website, there is no mention of it in the written information, and I wasn't able to find a EPS/Vertex video showing its installation.  Installation of the flex disc is straight forward; remove the 6 bolts, carefully pry off with a flat bar or screwdriver and slide the driveshaft back to remove it.On removal and inspection, the factory bearing support looked as bad as the one shown in the installation video, with the rubber completely eaten away.  I was surprised I didn't hear more thumping than the brief rumble I was experiencing on acceleration from a stop, at about 20 mph.The minimum tools required for installation are a #6 hex to tighten the 4 bolts on the EPS mount, 13mm and a 15mm sockets to remove the bolts on the bracket to the existing bearing support, a hack saw or pneumatic metal cutting wheel to remove the existing bearing support, 2  3 razor blades to slice the rubber off the bearing, a small flat head screwdriver or other pokey device to remove the seals on the bearing, a good quality bearing grease to repack the bearing, gloves, and safety glasses/goggles to keep the dirty bits of this and that from falling into your eyes.As others reported, the majority of your time will be spent shaving and cleaning all of the rubber off the bearing.  Some of the rubber can be removed with your fingers, but the majority of the removal will require a razor blade and a copious amount of time, persistence and patience.  After installation of the EPS mount, I took the vehicle for a drive and, while the 'rumble' is completely gone, I experience a vibration at 30 - 40 mph that can be felt in the headliner, which was not present before installation.  I removed the EPS mount and reinstalled it, making certain to firmly tighten down the bolts, however the vibration is still there.I contacted EPS/Vertex and spoke w/ support in the hopes they could offer a solution.  To eliminate the possibility of a defective mount, they shipped me out a new one, which I installed, which cured the vibration I was experiencing at ~30 mph, but now there was a brief flutter at ~40 mph (feels like driving over a rumble strip).  I again contacted Vertex and informed them of the issue I was now experiencing and they sent me out a rebuilt driveshaft that is pre-balanced and has an OEM flex disc and bearing mount pre-installed.  I had the rebuilt driveshaft installed by a local shop (not an authorized Porsche service station) for $150 (1-1/2 hours labor), which completely restored the ride quality in my Cayenne.  If you can get away with installing an EPS mount, and it works for you, purchase that, but if not, I'd recommend spending a bit more money and replacing the OEM driveshaft with a rebuilt one from Vertex.On a side note, customer service at Vertex is excellent and they promptly responded to all of my email and telephone calls.

Well I typically use No Touch but it was out of stock - so I tried this.  The outcome was "pretty good".  Would I buy again - possibly.  I use it on my Cladding on my Avalanche as well as the tires - the No Touch soaks in a bit better,  has a smoother blend after 1 coating..vs.....when I used Black Magic - I had to do 2 passes for the same results of 1 pass with No Touch.  I will update later to see how long it lasts.

We purchased the EMS-PT30X about 11 months ago and used it for 6 or 7 trips.  While using it recently, power abruptly when off in the RV.  The EMS showed no error; however, no power was being passed through to the RV.  We spoke to the after hours tech support on Sunday afternoon and he said to file a Warranty Claim online.  In less than two weeks from filing the Claim, we received a replacement EMS!Several things to note:The Lifetime Warranty does NOT include heat damage to the male plug or heat damage to the front receptacle!  They say such damage is typically due to old, dirty or poorly maintained plugs, adapters, and/or prongs/blades.  When filing a claim, you must provide photographs of the plug and receptacle.  Thankfully, that was not the problem with my EMS and it was covered under the warranty.I noticed a metallic sticker on the front of the replacement EMS.  When comparing the replacement to the original, the stick was applied to cover up the Made in the U.S.A.  On the back of the replacement EMS, is a sticker saying Assembled in Mexico.I was impressed that an After Hours tech returned a call on a Sunday afternoon!  He, obviously, could not fix this problem but it was reassuring that their technical support is available 7 days a week!

Having used two of these units in the past, I was eager to receive this new updated unit. The unit is working fine, however we've had a lot of rain here in Alaska this summer, and I noticed that the little green charged LED light has got some water you can see the green light and the water droplets inside it in the picture. The unit still seems to be functioning properly though. Will give more of an update after using for a while.

Extremely pleased with this purchase. I used these to replace the stripped plastic Phillips head fasteners that came with my 2007 Jeep Wrangler. The dealership was charging some absurd amount something near $1.65/ea for these so I decided to measure my originals and find replacements online. I am glad I did as these N807389S are the same size and have a different style head that will not strip on you. Honestly plastic phillips heads -- just a terrible idea unless the whole idea was to make you break them and have to replace them in the first place.Pros:1. Price -- Cheap, insanely cheap. You can literally break one each time you remove them and probably not care.2. Better style head on the fastener than the OEM phillips head ones.Cons:1. None that I am aware of.Notes:1. Sizes: 8mm - 4.8 x 4.5 x 0.3 inches2. If you have a 07-16 Jeep Wrangler JK these will fit your lower radiator shroud as well as the front grill (and probably a few other things that I haven't yet used them to replace yet)

I trailer my motorcycle fairly often, and an older biker guy recommended getting "soft straps" to me.  These straps seemed like one of the better choices, and I'm glad I got these!  It makes strapping my bike so much better and easier.  It can be very stressful going cross-country while you're worried about your bike sliding around in your trailer if its not strapped well.With these straps, I look them through the handle bars and ratchet them tightly to the floor D-rings.  I ratchet them TIGHT, compressing the front forks about 2".  This makes for a very stable ride, the bike doesn't budge an 1/8" even after bouncing around in a trailer for 1000 miles.  Really puts my mind at ease.

So i installed P235/75R15 Goodyear Wrangler on my 1995 Blazer 2 door 4x4. 2 days ago. My last set were Goodyear Tracker 2 from Walmart. I got 26,000 miles out of the tracker 2. They were 10 years old and started to crack but even tread wear on all 4 tires. Maybe 5,000 miles left on them. A very soft tire, but no problems with them at all. I got a very good deal on these, so i could not turn them down. The ride is very good so far. They are seem no louder then the Tracker 2 tires i had before. The Goodyear Tracker 2 were P235/70R15. These look much better by filling the fenders fully. There are a optional tires for the 1995 Blazer. I will update after a few more miles. 4 1/2 stars to start the rating. The date code shows the 52nd week of 2014. Very happy with that! Have to remember these are one of the lowest cost Goodyear  tires you can buy. But so far so good. There is no tread wear warranty on them. I would expect to get at least 25,000 to 30,000 miles out of them.Someone posted that they only had 2 belts and no steel. Here is a photo of the belt count, maybe hard to see. 2 Polyester and 2 steel belts for the tread. 2 Polyester for the side wall. Just setting the record straight.

I put a Ranch Hand bumper on my truck, which really killed the light output of my fog lights. These with a pair of Totron D2 knock offs resolved every light issue I had.I cut a set of 9005 Extension cables (Purchased here too) in half, then spliced them into the lights.  This let's me use them with the stock fog switch.

These lights, all things considered, offer a great value. For less than a hundred bucks you get a complete kit with everything needed to mount them to just about any vehicle. There are, however, some pretty big issues that should be addressed.First, the relay and wiring harnesses are NOT suitable for anything but 55w halogens and even then, you're really pushing your luck. Ideally, for 55w bulbs, you would have 14AWG wires and for 100W-130W bulbs, 12AWG wires. I'm not sure what size comes with the kit, but they're definitely way too small. They're also not copper core wire; maybe zinc plated something or another? Regardless, they're not copper. If you do decide to use the included wiring, be VERY careful as it is quite fragile and the insulation tears easily.I had the best luck by throwing away all of the wires that came with the lights and running 12AWG wire directly from the battery and into the light and to the bulb. I also threw away the included relay and purchased a 30/40A 4 pin relay from RadioShack. Running 100W or even 130W halogen bulbs is no problem. The relay gets slightly warm but the wires are cool to the touch.The beam produced is OK but I feel like it could definitely be better. Can't really complain for the price, though. It's not a pencil beam nor is it a flood beam - it's a "driving beam" which is supposed to offer a mix between spill (flood) and throw (distance).

I'm using these for a Ninja 300 and a Yamaha FZ6R. Both bikes go up with ease, and feel very secure once up. I also ordered the triple mount option, for when I want to take front wheel off. They're used for primarily chain maintenance, but will also be used for oil changes, farkling, and any other things that they would help with. I know there are probably better (expensive) options out there, but for what I need, these do the trick.

While I haven't had these long, I'm so far impressed. I've experimented with several other brands of bulbs and while most are bright and decently constructed, these are the first I've used that have a decent output pattern without black spots. The pictures don't fully capture the differences in light output between the stock halogen and LED, but still demonstrate that the LED's are superior. I replaced both the H9LL and H11LL bulbs in my 2015 Camaro with these bulbs and both fit and functioned without issue. The only caveat I might have is that the external driver requires a bit of room behind the headlight. In the Camaro, the headlight enclosure is tight and has sealed panels, so these fit tightly, but still fit. Also, these are slightly longer than the halogen bulbs, but not so much that fitment was a problem. Compared to other LED bulbs I've used, I'd rate these among the best and would definitely recommend.

I was getting p0128 errors-engine not getting to thermostat regulating temperature in my 2007 ION. To make things complicated, when that error occurs the fan runs all the time and the temperature gauge reads zero. I think the ECM, not knowing what the problem is (bad temp sensor?), just assumes the worst and runs the fan and sets the temp gauge to zero to get your attention. If you clear the error code the fan and the temp gauge behave normally until the next error.Installation was dicey because I couldn't get the hose off the thermostat housing. The clamp was oriented so I couldn't get my pliers on it. One of those cable clamp thingees they sell on Amazon was useless. I was doing my surge tank at the same time, and so since the surge tank hose is loosened up, that allows removing the thermostat housing with the radiator hose still attached. Easy job. The thermostat just drops in.Be sure to drain the coolant before you start, or else prepare to catch the coolant as you removed the thermostat housing.The photo shows my older thermostat. Note in the attached photo the gasket was failing on the old one, causing erratic P0128 errors (The engine only has 15 minutes to reach operating temperature before the error code is thrown.) You should really replace thermostats before they become a real problem. A cold car in the winter is an almost sure sign they are failing.

It's a good rack for the money.  I bought it with the extension and it's a very nice size for my 2000 dodge durango.  Why 3 stars?  The mounting brackets are horrible.  The bracket is all bent after one run on the beach and can no longer fit securely on the crossbars.  I even emailed curt to see about replacements but got no response.  I'm going to go to the hardware store and rig something up.After 3 years the rack is still holding up.  I rigged up new brackets and they are secure now.  This picture includes the extension.

The lights look decent from distance but they were poorly manufactured and have several flaws. The biggest flaw is the sockets for the bulbs are very short and the bulbs are pushing up against the inside of the lamp. I am using LED bulbs but they're only slightly longer than stock. I'm sure if you're running stick bulbs, they would heat up and melt the inner plastic. Also, the sides of the plastic outter shroud is chipped and looks like it was broken off a mass mold. Very poorly designed. See pictures... Also, these lamps do NOT come with hardware to screw into. Expect to have to cannibalize your old lamps or buy new screws and clips.

Bought these for my 2014 Passat and they are a perfect fit. The mats are high quality and don't have that funky smell you get from cheap mats at a big box store. Install was easy, just remove your old mats and line these up with the round mounting clips. The hardest part was actually removing the mats from the plastic clip that holds them together. I used a small butter knife to pry it open just enough to slip one end of each mat out then slowly worked them out of the rest of the clip, definitely be careful not to pull or force the mat out, the plastic clip is very strong and could pull/stretch or rip the mat. Overall, very pleased with my purchase. You can't beat the custom look these mats offer.

Seemed like a great idea, but disappointing in the execution.When I ordered this, I assumed the airbox housing was made of anodized aluminum.  It's not; it's a cheap-looking plastic.  It isn't the tough, flexible kind of plastic, like that used on motorcycle airboxes.  It's made of a shiny, hard plastic, which I suspect may be susceptible to breaking, cracking, and/or melting from the engine heat.It's pretty big, too; about 7-8" diameter and about 11" long.  Make sure you have room for it if you get it, and make sure you're ok with it being plastic.  I wouldn't trust it near anything hot.I sent mine back to Amazon and got a K&N filter, and will be making my own airbox.

They're larger than I expected but that wasn't an issue. I received mine with scratches and grooves already in them but the mounts won't be seen with my application. The rubber inserts that make them more of a universal mount don't quite fit right either. Overall though good deal for the price. You can't really even see them with the spot lights I used.

I have been looking for a hitch cover for awhile and when I saw this, it looked perfect.  Just everything else I buy off Amazon, reviews are very important. I was looking for a flag that is made of all metal and this was it. Looks great on the truck as you can see by the puctures.

This remote start was installed in a 93 Toyota P/U, Manual and fuel injected.  My vehicle had no special options, such as power locks, windows, installed alarm, etc.I'm currently stationed in Alaska and a remote start is pretty much a necessity up here.  I did some research before purchasing this system and determined that this was a no/low frills unit and would exactly meet my needs.  Below are a few things that I would point out to people interested in purchasing and installing this themselves:This unit will integrate into a vehicle with an existing "factory" alarm.  This was determined by the options in the wiring diagram to attach to the existing alarm system.You will also have the option to have this remote start to "power up" x2 or x3 options.  Two are high power options, one of which I attached to the blower motor (as recommended in the instructions), the other high power options they recommended connecting to the rear defroster.  If I remember correctly, there was an additional 12v accessory output which wasn't a large wire/high power option.  Just don't EXACTLY remember...Another option that this system includes is automatic lock/unlock of the door locks.  My vehicle didn't have that feature so I can't exacly go into depth on the setup and operation.This system has a sensor that will help to know when to shut the starter down on the vehicle when it has "started".  Once I read how this worked I was VERY happy with this purchase and the operation.  Many other systems require the system to "read" an iginition source from the vehicle's ignition system.  This one takes a prilimary voltage setting "base line".  It then initiates the starting sequence, once it reads that there is a higher voltage available when compared to the baseline it shuts down the starting operation.  Ultimately, this is reading the battery voltage.  When the vehicle "starts" and the alternator is producing charging voltage the system understands that the vehicle MUST be running because of the higher voltage available, and shuts down.  AWESOME!  My truck, being older sometimes dies after it has started.  Combine that to -40* temps we have experienced this week (prior to me writing the review!!) When the remote starter sensed that the voltage dropped back down to the baseline voltage, even AFTER having started (a failed start ultimately), the starting system re-started the truck.  The ONLY problem I've experienced was due to my install and the options I then chose.  For instance, my truck will sometimes start but not have a high enough RPM to "excite" the alternator to start putting out voltage.  I've had the truck experience a "hung starter".  I let the truck run its course just to see what would happen, basically so I would know in the future what to expect and to know if I could depend/trust this device to meet my needs in Alaska.  Well in the instance of the hung starter the attemt was continued for about 3 seconds and then shutoff. At that point the truck shutoff and the system reset.  My truck then started on the second attempt by the device.  THis is by NO MEANS a fault of the starting system, just an issue with my truck.  The wiring harness did come with an option to connect to the negitive side of the distributor (helps the system to know that the vehicle is running).  I had opted not to use this wire.  While I had considered re-installing the wire into the wire harness, I decided that my current configuration is probably better suited for my needs.  My reasoning for this is if my truck doesn't have the alternator charging and the system continued to run ultimately the battery would be getting discharged.  The winters up here are hard enough on our battery and starting systems, so I'll deal with the slight grinding an a very rare ocassion (I've only seen it happen once) and know that when it is running that the battery is also getting charged.On installing:By memory, I only used the two 12v input (constant 12v connections) off the power source going to the keyOne wire back into the "key on" wire in the vehicleone wire into the "ignition" wire on the vehicle (initially the truck woudl crank but not run until I found this wire)One wire grounded*Neutral safety/automatic safety switch (was actually connected to the same "grounded" location" as the ground wireBypassed my "clutch" safety switch.  I cut these wires and soldered and taped them.  The vehicle always now thinks the clutch is pressed in.One wire to the 12v positive side of the blower motor system (Environmental control system)One wire to the 12v positive side of the brake light switch (safety to shut the system down)One wire to the 12v NEGITIVE side of the light relay out of the steering column. **NOTE!  You may need a relay if your system isn't 12v NEG!!!Small push-button switch - This actually doesn't seem to do anything, that is unless I failed to connect it to the control box.  I may check on this later, but it is supposed to keep the vehicle running when pushed the vehicle is running.  It didn't seem to work on mine.  But as stated, it could be my fault.  It is also used for "programming" and making changes to the options.NOTE!!There are two wires I "should" have used, but didn't for my existing setup.  My vehicle horn doesn't work, so I didn't connect the horn wire and the "hood pin switch".  I opted not to install that, but did install the supplied "warning" sticker.  This is my vehicle and I'm well aware that there is a remote start on it."Installer notes" (if you will).This is defaulted to running for 12 minutes. Not nearly long enough for the -40 and colder temps here in Alaska.  The push button switch I mentioned above is supposed to be an option to changing the programming.  My horn not working is part of my problem for changing the programming as you are required to react to horn beeps.There is a supplied "toggle switch" which I believe to be an "off switch".  There were not provided instructions on to where to put this.  I believe it would be an interrupt switch to the negitive side of the control system, but opted just not to install it.  I may have overlooked this in the instructions, but just stating it like they do the other break out of the wires coming out of the harnesses.For all the additional wires I didn't need I just "yanked" them out of the harness while it wasn't attached to the control box.  This eliminates the "rats nest" of additional wires under the dash.Take some time!!!  Pull out the instruction book and read through what wires will be required for your install.  I don't intend for this to sound harsh, but if you can't figure out what you will need, take your vehicle in and have this professionally installed.I'm pretty good at vehicle wiring and have installed car radios in past when I was younger.  I didn't have any issues with installing this, but ONLY did so because this vehicle is old enough and operates off of 12v and 12v only.  There are no different voltages on different systems for different readings.  There is no way I would have tried this on my 09 GMC Sierra or the wife's 08 Mazda CX9.  I previously had a Pontiac Grand Am and the aftermarket installed remote start later had a problem and activated the factory alarm.  At that point the vehicle had to be towed to the dealer to identify the problem, back to the installer and have the system removed, and back to the dealer once again to have the security system reset.  At that point it was driven back to the installer and a new system was installed.The instructions CLEARLY state you MUST have a multi-meter, not a test light.  I highly, highly recommend you do as suggested.  The wiring diagram I had for my vehicle (Chilton/Hayes type manual) was absolutely WRONG with the wire codes and colors.  I probably would have blown a fuse while trying to determine what wires I needed since the vehicle manual was wrong.BITWRITER - Programmer.  Many times the manual describes going to a factory installer and having them program your unit to better meet your needs.  I haven't done so and I've done a quick search.  I've found numerous bitwriters (different ones) for under a hundred dollars.  I'm positive that a factory installer will charge about $100 to "program" this.  Just buy it yourself and you now can make the changes you need at your desire.  (just a suggestion ;) )In closing:This device is awesome for my needs.  Most all the "remote starting systems" out there are vehicle alarms with a remote starter option added on.  This adds a bunch of wires and other problems that we as vehicle owners don't want to deal with.  By eliminating the unneeded items, we have a simple and flawless system for starting our vehicles.  I highly recommend this unit and firmly believe that it does its job and does it well.  I currently can't say for the range of the remote, but I've tried it well inside of military buildings (all brick and metal construction" and when the unit won't start the vehicle it makes a loud noise to let you know that the starting attempt was a "no-go".  (Oh, and the LED illuminates either orange or red... I don't remember).The install is pretty simple, I recommend soldering the connections as recommended, scotch locks were not recommended in the instructions, but I have seen EVERY alarm and remote start installed with these. Use at your own risk.Take your time and plan it out.  Get a factory manual, it may be of help.  I believe [...] has an option to download free wiring diagrams (years ago) and they may still be available.  Check that source prior to purchase if you're trying to look at ways to trim your total cost.The remote is pretty small, but still doesn't look or feel flimsy.  The key chain hole isn't large enough to add a non-supplied key chain to it, you would have to add it to the provided small key ring.There is a location for an external LED (I believe), but also a LED on the side of the control box for aid in programming and status.  But this is usually hidden under the dash somewhere...

I went with other people's reviews and glad I did. These were sturdy in my opinion and worked well. Got a good bite on the band as it should. Recommend.  Did just fine for me. Worth the few extra bucks.

I bought this soap from meijer, it's the same thing. I power washed my car, then literally squirted this on the cars hood and trunk, and added some to my microfiber car scubber and went at it. I scrubbed it into the paint really really thick and then power washed it off. I gave it a final rinse with a really wide and sharp powerwash setting. Wiped a little water off the roof and hood/trunk areas that were really flat. And BOOM! Car looks flawless. Less than a 10 min wash and it looks great! Really cloudy out and not s single water stain. I have to admit this stuff works pretty well!

If your like me you want to do your research before making such a big purchase.  Well,  read ahead to solidify whether you purchase this or not.Pros.Looks amazing,  I love the glass windows and the hydraulic assist for the rear window.  The fabric is some of the best feeling /strongest I've seen yet.  Very good quality.Cons.I know this isn't anyone's fault but the shipping company, but I received the passenger door surround broken. (see picture) I called bestop and they had me send in to their customer service who had me go through me warranty for it.  More of a nuisance than anything but still should not have happened.  other than that,  not too bad of an install Got it done in 2 hours.The wind noise is horrendous.  I mean wind tunnel bad. It's more silent with no top at all!When I installed it the passenger and driver side window fabric seemed to have come free from its track (see picture) I didn't force it down at all so there should be no reason for this.  The fabric leads directly inside my jeep so I have 2 holes in my top.That's about the whole review.  Whole top I'd say 6.5/10 and for the money,  they should include the wiper mechanism.

Unfortunately, these are no good. I bought the 48mm version, and I was impressed with the build quality and fit, until I held it up to the light. The filter element does not extend down to the bottom of the filter, where the chrome end cap is. Consequentially, if you use these, your engine will be sucking everything right in through the bottom and down into your engine. It's really unfortunate as it fit my bike perfectly.

Even with the reviews about the excellent brightness, I did not believe fully until they were installed and tested at night. They ARE really bright.I put these on a '04 Jeep Grand Cherokee Brush Bar, to make trips to the woods coon hunting safer. Used LAMPHUS CRUIZER wiring harness for wiring. Great pair. See my review for wiring kit, and push bar.I will be ordering another set for my golf cart.The price is also excellent.

With the purchase of this double-pack Kootek Car Cabin Air Filter Replacement, I easily replaced both 2013 Camry and 2011 Highlander.  Perfect fit.  Good, solid replacement filter really helps keep pollen and pollutants out of the cabin.  So simple to replace, even your grandmother could do it.  No offense, Nana. I know your a smart cookie!!!!

Works great with an Android head unit in a 2003 Silverado 1500HD with the Bose system and rear radio. Keeps the rear radio functional and the steering wheel controls working. Has an output for the reverse trigger on a backup camera. The "dinger" takes some getting used to. Works great, but not for the faint of heart.

Ive had the standard philips 9012 in the single yellow packaging in my other Camry 2004 XLE V6. Bought those standard 9012 back in mid 2015 and they are still going good. They worked well once you do the socket teeth modification in place of 9006. I figure these 9012CVB version would be just as good in my 2004 SE I4 ( yes, I have multiple cars).Well, they are, except the lifespan is a bit lacking. Not really the bulb fault as its noted on the back of it the average lifespan.These bulbs last me about 3.5 months before one of the two goes bad. I drive a lot and almost always driving with my headlights. Im on my second set and one of my second set bulb went out tonight.Id buy them again, but maybe not the CVB versions.

Same uniform brightness and light distribution as brand new OEM 7743 lamp. Standard lamps dim as they age, these don't. Tail/Brake brightness difference the same as OEM. Color is slightly redder than OEM, but that's what I expected from LED. Be sure to order the RED lamps for tail lights, the white ones won't look right!! As others have noted the shipped LED looks different than the stock photo, but performs just fine.See image:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo37J1K4TUUZWY5/B001FCPZLG

I am very happy with my purchase so far.  These seem to be great quality and lights are bright as I like them.  I installed these as my license plate lights and they beat the other LEDs Ive had prior.  The other LEDs would die or flicker after a while so it was really annoying to adjust or replace.  These have been on for 4 months now and theyve been working great and they give my 2006 Toyota Corolla a nice look.  See photos to see the brightness at night.  I would definitely recommend these lights, and I also love that they come in a pack of 10!

Philips H11 CrystalVision Ultra Upgrade, these are replacements for the low beams in a 2007 Tahoe, my drivers side lamp went out. The original lasted nearly 10 years! here's to hoping this replacement last at least half that long. The light is a nice bright white with just a slight tinge of blue, the color range is rated at 4000k. The bulbs are are identical to the OEM that it replaced. As another review mentioned, do take care to not handle or touch the glass portion of the bulb, as the oils from your hands or grease from the engine area can cause hot spots on the bulbs glass and shorten the bulb's life.  The install time on the 2007 Tahoe was about 1 total, the wheel wells have to be partially removed to access a hidden bolt and the top bolts of the front facia have to be removed to allow your hand access to the back of the lamp assembly that you can tilt forward to access the lamp socket.

The paint color was acceptable but the problem was it drips. Perhaps if you painted something flat it would work better. If you are painting the side of a car, I suggest using a brush instead. I ended up trying to wipe off most of the drips, spraying paint into the cap, and dipping a piece of a paper towel in the paint to use as a paint brush.

So I ordered these thinking they were the mesh type of window clings (because I had previously bought JEEP brand window clings that were the mesh kind) these are not the mesh kind. I ordered four of them (one for each rear side window next to where my kids sit) and I am still unsure about them. We have tinted windows already, and this just seems to be a cling that looks like a thick piece of window tinting that can be easily removed. So I am kinda bummed. One of the window clings has a chunk missing from the corner, and the edges are kinda ridged looking on 3 of the four clings. I think buying the cheap ones from Walmart would have been a better and cheaper idea. These had to be warm to get them to cling to the windows, and they don't stick very evenly. There are bubbles everywhere that won't come out too. They seem very cheaply made. I personally wouldn't buy them again. They don't seem to help block out sun at all like I was hoping, to help keep the rear leather seats from getting too hot. Just kinda disappointed with them since they are nothing at all like I was expecting. They are not even as dark as what is pictured/advertised.

Helps filter out the junk!I bought a 12 pack of these (direct from K&N) and I'm glad I did, it's saving me from having to rebuild several carburetors... one on my motorcycle in particular... I must have got a bug or something in my fuel the last time I filled up... found this fuzzy little black thing floating around in my fuel filter when I looked things over today... I'm sure some of you know it's not much fun pulling apart and cleaning a carburetor...So far I put them on my 2 motorcycles (Kawasaki KLR 650 and a Bashan 200 Enduro), several riding lawn mowers (Husqvarna), a 80's Honda Rototiller, and whatever else I can get them to fit onto! Don't know about everyone else but I'm tired of cleaning the jets and all the microscopic holes on my carburetors every time I get a bad batch of fuel or the rare occasion some bug decides to 'land' in my gas tank

This worked perfect adding a key to my 2008 Ford Focus.  I bought the key on eBay and had it cut at the hardware store, then used this unit to program the key in the immobilizer.  It doesn't come with any instructions, so I suggest looking on YouTube to familiarize yourself with how it works.  I looked through the menus on the ck-100 to see how many tokens it used to program a key, but I couldn't find anything about tokens.  Although, this unit supposedly has a set number of tokens and when they are used up it will no longer work until you buy a chip with more.  I was unable to confirm this on my programmer.UPDATE: Two days later I powered on the unit to see if a different vehicle was in the menu and the unit just turned off while I was scrolling through the menu. Now the light on the power supply flashes and the unit will not power up.  I reduced my rating to 4 stars since it died after one use.I'm not sure how current this is, but here is a list of compatible vehicles:http://www.cnautotool.com/images/upload/File/CK-100%20IMMOBILIZER%20vehicle%20list.xls

Wow best leather cleaning brush for car interiors. In the used car business I have Adams cockpit brush also which is softer and is better for headliners, door panels and light dirt in leather. This colour lock brush blows adams away for cleaning leather seats. It Made seats in 1998 infiniti i30 look brand new along with some mothers all purpose cleaner. Great product colour lock and you cant beat the price. I love this brush so much I ordered another one. When your done cleaning with this brush just rinse in warm water and let air dry.  My go to brush for cleaning very soiled leather seats look how it made the seats in my 1998 infiniti look. Like brand new the passenger door hasn't been cleaned yet so you can see the difference.

Got them quick. Though amazon says they don't fit my 2002 Intruder 1500 online forums said they fit, so I took a chance and ordered them. They are "almost" exact but a little wider in circumference so the filler chrome piece wouldn't fit and the hole for the connector and wire to slide through were not big enough, I drilled out the hole and sanded down the rubber. It fits now but would like to get ones that fit better but for now I am on the road. Is there another part number??  The pics are side by side and fitment, the other pic is the original and how snug it fits. Good enough for now.

Easy to install on a Chevy K3500 third brake light application, and provides better visibility and awareness of your intention to stop or slow down, for those distracted knuckleheads behind you, who inevitably follow to close.This is a follow up review, 7 months later.A few days ago, my third brake light failed. Was hoping it was the two bulbs, but obviously for both to fail at the same time would be an odd occurrence. Unfortunately, the control box had an issue and had apparently overheated and burned out an internal connection causing total third brake light failure. Not sure how hot it became before it's failure, just glad it was in an all metal compartment.  Will replace with another brand.

I received this part with damage, the white cover is plastic and it was cracked. I just removed it since it is only a cosmetic cover if you want to call it that. I do not see how the cover would protect from any environment. Second dislike it the threads of the outlet are so poorly casted, they do not seal to the mating adapter (not provided) at all. I had to use a lot of Teflon tape, and I mean a lot to get a good seal.

I had high hopes for these LEDs with all the great reviews I've read on Amazon. Those great reviews couldn't have been more incorrect in my case. I bought these bulbs for a 2014 Nissan Altima which have projector headlights. These bulbs are a horrible product for my car. The projection or "throw" of the light up the road is simply inadequate and quite frankly dangerous. I took these out for a test drive in a light drizzle at night and could barely see the road 20 feet ahead of me. It was very nerve racking ride that I could not wait to be over because I was forced to drive 15 mph to even be able to stay within my lane. I simply could not see. These are dimmer than my standard halogen bulbs, which are rated at about 1250 lumens. These are no where near 2000 lumens. The blue tint of the light throws off your contrast so you cannot easily differentiate between different objects.To make matters worse, when I removed the drivers side bulb after a few days to put my halogen bulbs back in, I found that one of the cheaply glued on LEDs had delaminated from the housing and fell off completely! These bulbs aren't durable and could not stand up to the light use that I put them through over the course of a few days. Very disappointed in this product and will be returning them. Maybe they will work Ok with other vehicles or cars with reflector housing headlights.

It does what it says.  No surprises here.  There are no instructions, so here's what you have to do... THINK.  Just take 5 minutes and think about how to deploy the winch cover.  Do that, and you'll be fine.The cover is large enough for my X20 Comp 12k Smittybilt winch, so I don't know WHAT people are talking about, saying it didn't fit. I re-laced the cinch cord through the eyelets, and used 2 bungee cords for insurance.  The cover is a dull finish and black, unlike the images that show either a grey cover or a shiny black cover.  It is a dull-ish sail cloth material. I included a few pictures to show what it really looks like.If you're on the fence and you own an X20 winch... BUY THIS AND STOP WORRYING.  Hear me now - believe me later.

Purchased this unit because it was cheap and had great reviews and I can see why. My tires kept going flat every 2 weeks and I got tired of having to drive on base or to the gas station and pray the air pump was working which 9/10 times its not and who wants to pay a 1.00 for air right? So I got this and let me say first thoughts were is this gonna be strong enough because the unit is small,like really small and to my surprise it actually inflated my tire with no problem (aftermarket 22 inch rims) The pump comes with attachments for other types of applications to blow are in like a inflatable bed or basketball. It als features a fuse on the power cord that has a cover on it. I saw reviews of people saying the pump blew a fuse in their car but it did not blow mine I kept the car running as I used it (2008 Dodge Charger).This is a great pump and I have no complaints also another plus is the extremely long power cord!

Nice produce, looks and fits like OEM, I purchase this to my cousin in Central America, he have a Toyota Fielder 2006, (like a Corolla Wagon) but this version is assembly in Brazil, and sold as Fielder and Corolla wagon for south American market from 2006 to 2009, the Toyota's original part was #68960-xxxxx and #68950-xxxxx, these parts number fits with the stay assy back door of the Toyota MATRIX ZRE142L 2001 to 2008.  The rear Door of the Fielder have, spoiler, rear window wiper and power lock, even with all this weight, opens as brand new.  The only fact is, I purchase 2, so because I have to ship them to Central America, the box was too big and have a lot of unnecessary paper, which affects the ship price and the environment.

Have an F150 and was never thrilled about the amount of light put out by the OE dome and map lights, wanted something more...Bought these along with JDM ASTAR 48 bulbs for the dome, after the install I was shocked how much brighter the interior of my truck was especially at night.For the F150 enthusiasts out there there is a site (pricier) that has the basic how to videos I would recommend watching if you don't know what you're doing.

The microfiber towel arrived in a sealed plastic bag, so luckily that had prevented the towel from getting contaminated as it arrived to the consumers. Inside the plastic bag consisted of two towels surrounded by paper case that specifies instructions and information of the towels themselves. The towel is somewhat soft to the touch, brown in color, and average thickness as you would see at retail stores. The towel is 13.2 inches by 5.1 inches.I had tested this on cleaning the interior of my cars leather (dashboard, seats, upholstery) and it worked wonderfully. I picked up dust/debris well. As for the absorption rate, when drying/wiping up liquid, it was fair and decent in terms of quality; basically similar to the microfiber towels you would use if you bought it at in-store retail places. However, it did seem to hold more liquid than the traditional microfiber towels in the market. Cleaning this product is very simple and easy; you can simply hand wash it or put it in the washing machine. Make sure to launder separately as this would contain a lot more dirt and contamination than regular clothing/bedsheets. Instructions state to use on warm water cycle, but I used it on cold water cycle and I didn't notice any change (but I guess time will tell). I recommend giving this product a try as it does appear to be different than the traditional microfiber towels Ive used when I bought them in-stores at a few places. I had received this product at a discount in exchange for my review after testing it out a few times.

Great product for my race car. I have a C5 Z06 Corvette, and it has a composite hood. It takes some careful cutting, but the results are great! The only issue is that the included screws aren't long enough for half the holes, and I had to go to Ace Hardware to pickup some longer ones (hence the silver bolts).

I don't know where the confusion is but this does NOT replace the driver side 2001 F-350. The length and attachment are correct, but the angle of the arm is about 10 degrees off from the original. It sits with the bottom of the blade touching the bottom of the windshield and the top of the blade sticks up at an angle. I will return it and try another brand.

Right out of the box i noticed the chrome plating is sharp and jagged along the edges. I had flakes of chrome on my fingers. Its mainly where the flat hex sides meet near the domed  top of the nut. With the pricepoint Im mot risking it and sent them back. Being chrome its impossible to photo.  Mayne i just got a bad set. Also these were all in a bag in a box, not in pakagaing like normal lug nuts where they can bang in to each other.

I was really really excited to get these in the mail! I placed my order knowing it gave me the "want it Tuesday?" Order by "this time".I was surprised to get the notification that the order had shipped around the time it was supposed to arrive.  Fast forward a few days and I get the package.Remember. These are long steps so the box is good size. When I went to move the box I has happy to feel how heavy it was.  That's where I stopped being happy.The steps are pretty light weight, less then a few pounds each. The bottom of the step is slotted Aluminum and the rest is plastic with the rubber section for your feet. The instructions are pretty basic and straight forward but not labeled for any one truck. Can I assume the instructions in the box are for my specific truck?I laid out all the pieces, 4 mounting brackets on each side and the hardware to attach them. The brackets seem well made and are plenty heavy.The issue is the brackets bolted up to my truck in 2 out of 4 spots on each side. ( 2007 Chevy Silverado new body style) The top mounting holes for the brackets were not present on the front driver and passenger side.  I mounted the step on the brackets (only mounted to the hole in the rocker panel) to give it a look and see if it was worth drilling some holes.At the end of the day, I did t like the quality of these steps, the flimsy plastic shell over aluminum didn't do it for me. The brackets were not easily made to fit (in my case) and they hung down to low.I'll be returning these.2 stars because of the over all quality, cheap feel. Steps didn't fit correctly and shipping delays.The figment issue may not be the manufactures fault but I have to warn potential buyers some how.

Great fit and finish, although it doesn't quite match the factory panels. It's a lighter gray than the piece it replaces, and the texture is a finer grain than the factory pillar.The switches are quite easy to install, and cutting out the blanks isn't very hard, just be careful so you don't scratch the panel. I followed the lines and then had to shave a little more off the edges to get a good fit for the switches, but they don't move, and line up great!Jeep tip: if you're running wires from the outside (like for A-Pillar lights), there is a hole under the corner cowl where you can pass the wires through the foam filler. It gives a perfect spot to run it up next to the dashboard and right into this switch pod.

I bought a cheap windshield that came with plastic clamps... Since I'm already a skill mounter I knew the exact size and what to look for to replace that plastic clamp. Once the plastic gets too much sun then come in contact with rain, snow and cold temperatures it would be broken within a year minimum... with this... That's life time guaranteed, plus I can restock it when it gets rusted because I can buy it again.

First-  I am not a professional mechanic or professional driver.  I have been working on cars, it feels like, since birth (40+ years).  I have rebuilt and replaced pretty much every nut, bolt, screw, and component on dozens of vehicles including dozens of "brake jobs"- both factory replacement and performance upgrades.  I know which end of a wrench to use.  Fortunately, I also have an engineering background and three advanced degrees, blah, blah, blah.  Not bragging, just setting the stage for what I like to think is a fairly qualified review so----I have been running these brakes and rotors on an Altima 3.5SR Coupe for about six months.  This is NOT a track car and I don't pretend that it is a world-class (or even county-class!) sports car.  It is quick and heavy for a coupe and the factory setup just isn't well-engineered. The factory brakes never provided much stop-confidence and had given up completely by about 45,000 miles.  I have used numerous "performance kits" in the past (most recently Hawk and EBC) on other vehicles with sporadic performance so I figured, given the excellent Amazon price (just under $300 when I purchased), I'd take a shot with Power Stop, and I am thrilled that I did.Based on the sum of my lifetime braking experiences, the Power Stop K242 kit (pads, clips, rotors; front and rear) far exceeded my wildest expectations.  Installation was very straightforward (minus some Nissan irritation).  Bedding was smooth and easy and once done, pedal response was exceptional.  With these brakes and rotors, there is NO fade (I mean NONE) on even the most spirited commutes on some of the US's most idiot-plagued roadways.  Braking is straight and consistent- no wobble or pull.  Even when all four corners are hot, there's no pulsation or anything that makes the driver feel unsure.  From an aesthetic perspective, the rotors look great and the pads (after break-in/bedding) yield almost NO dust.  I took a little extra time to paint all but the friction surfaces on my rotors to limit rust, limit dust build, and promote longer-term aesthetic appeal.  (I used VHT high-temp primer and Dupli-Color black caliper paint available from Amazon).  DO NOT EXPECT BLACK & SILVER ROTORS with your kit as captured in my pictures.  They come "bare" metal.Other brake kits have performed well early-on for me, but after six hard months (just over 8,400 miles of travel), the Power Stops are still performing perfectly (and props to VHT and Dupli-Color since finishes are still impeccable).  I am beyond thrilled with the astronomical improvement this kit affords me over factory gear and over any other "performance" system I've ever used (aside from very expensive "big brake" conversions).  As long as I can find a similar Power Stop kit to fit my cars, I will use nothing else.NOTE:  There were multiple "anti-rattle" clips in my kit for both the front and the rear.  MAKE SURE you remove your factory clips and compare them VERY carefully with the kit's clip options.  There are some very subtle differences--slot width/depth, one little tab here versus one little tab there-- that can be direly important to brake function (beyond rattling and squealing concerns).IMPORTANT NOTE:  As with any new pad/rotor installation, you MUST bed the pads!  It can be a pain, particularly if you live in a congested, urban area but it is critical to short- and long-term performance.  Each manufacturer has a somewhat specific approach/recommendation, and I highly recommend you follow the procedure for YOUR kit, not what your chronically greasy neighbor tells you.  There are some engineered specifics.  The Power Stop process provided in the kit's written directions was simple, straight-forward and easy to follow (there are lots of YouTube videos- maybe one by the manufacturer, that can help if you're new to this).  You can see in my pictures how the rotors, after bedding, change color/tone-  you can see the darker "ring" where pad material is deposited and the rotors become a bit more smoothly honed.  Seating the pads to the rotors and depositing pad material on the rotor at proper temperatures is essential for solid braking and for system longevity-  have I gotten my point across?  DO NOT SKIMP ON THE BEDDING PROCESS!

Nice, Simple, Easy to clean. I have tried $40 paint gun and got what I paid for -  the paint job I have to redo. This gun is by no means is expensive, but it is from reputable vendor and it does its job well. Recommended for primer color/clear coats, but you could also buy 1.8 and 1.5 nozzle/needle kits and transform it to primer, sealer gun. And it excels in all those coats with consistent, generous, wet coats. Good atomization, wide fan. Though you need to have 12 SCFM air delivery. Do not bother with 120V compressors it would not be enough.

Initial impression is fantastic! No it doesnt come with a template but you can find the specs online. I added the Ford official to my review. Ford comes with a foam template.... these do NOT.I got the carbon fiber letters and they are legitimately about 20 layers of carbon fiber glued together. It is a high quality look and I would buy it again. Ill update if longevity wears on them.When placing them, take note that the letters are not the same width, so start about 6.5 from the top of the headlight and work your way in with 1 masking tape between each letter. Use the masking tape to temp hang the letters, then once you get it straight, pull and stick.

Bought these to start doing my own oil changes and brake pad changes on my 2008 Dodge charger with aftermarket 22 inch rims. The jacks gave me extra insurance along with blocks. I would have to say befor ebuying i saw reviewers comment on the welding>I myself took a look closely and yes these jacks do have some poor welding very poor as well as even gaps in the weld lines. With that being said i felt comfortable enough using these as the 2nd string of protection

All purpose spray you can use it on anything also long as you clean the surface first with running alcohol and let it dry, great buy love you can change the look of your car in two seconds, for the job I did I used about a 3/4th of the can be used I did make it thick so I in the future be easy to take off. For rims it's recommend 2 full cans, I can't compline, great investment, easy to apply, anyone could do it!

To be frank, I wasn't expecting much out of this hook since it was cheap. Our car is our home when we are traveling especially long distances. My wife keeps her purse on the car seat and always complains that it is coming in between and such. Now our car does have all things like the kickmat and the  car backseat organizer and such. This is good for most cases.But we have situations where we want to keep stuff standing so it does not turn sideways or cases where my wife can easily keep her purse. These hooks are really useful for such situations. These are not something you may use on a  daily basis but good to have thing. The occupy very little space and can easily fit your cars headrest pipe. There is no expertise required with installation as the only thing you will do is push the open end in the pipe all the way and you are done.Due to the way it is constructed, it does not tilt when it is loaded so you know that it won't give way when you have hung something on it. You can hang as light stuff as your earphones or heavy stuff like some groceries. This hook will take it. The hooks look good and are functional.*I received this product at a discount to provide a honest and unbiased feedback. All opinions expressed are my own on the basis of my usage of the product.

1-25-18 UPDATEI called American star and the were happy to replace my tie rods at no cost, customer support was top notch, products do fail, its all about how the company handles the situation. while the ride could have been very bad, they did make it right.I installed these to prevent from bending the stock tie rods on my 2017 brute, i was about 10 miles into trails at hatfield, when the tie rod snapped off at the steering stem. Luckily i was going slow and didn't get hurt. i replaced it with the factory assembly that i carry as a spare. back on the trail and not 15 minutes later the other one snapped, again riding very slow thankfully. i had to clamp the two bad tie rods together to get out of the woods, luckily im  a mechanic and was able to craft together a tie rod assembly or i would have been in trouble getting out of the woods, of course no cell service. Not to mention these jam nuts constantly back off and get loose.

Everywhere I look up the Fel Pro head bolt set, they same Fel-Pro ES 74034 Cylinder Head Bolt Set part number comes up for a 1987 4.3 "Z" motor.  In my experience, the part number is NOT right for the 4.3 "Z" motors.I rebuilt an engine out of a 91 C1500 with a "Z" Motor that went into my 1987 Astro.  I think this is a bad number from the manufacturer and NOT Amazon or any other vendor as they all show the same head bolt set. If you look at my pics you'll see the difference of the "med length" bolts.  These are for the lower corners of the head.  4 in total needed of this size to do both heads.  The Fel Pro Med size bolts do not reach the threads in the block at all.But right on the side of the box it shows explicitly for  4.3 "W" engine, the first real Vortec with balance shaft.  See my pics.So buyer beware if doing for a 4.3 "Z". What I just lived through says (and the side of the box) is that this set is for the "early Vortec" engines and NOT "Z" motors.

We'll see if it works well enough to justify the installation. I started with the 2" wide but found it has a hard time not buckling on the curves of the exhaust so switched to 1" on the second pipe. Also, I did not like the fit or use of the steel zip ties. When you tighten them it twists the wrap. The hose clamps are much easier to use and are more secure. I painted my wrap with the silicone high temp paint before installation and I wrapped my exhaust installed. I had problems getting the exhaust off so just kept it on. I do recommend some wetting to get the wrap tight. It does leach black either from the wrap or paint. The reason for 4 stars is the wrap unravels really easily. Wherever you cut it the threads start coming apart. Wetting helps keep it together while you wrap. I have pics of the wrap and with the zip ties and hose clamps. I removed most of the ties and replaced them with the hose clamps. You can just measure the diameter of the pipe and buy a few hose clamps in that size. I have also included a pic of the smoking on initial burn off after installation. There was still a fair amount of heat felt but I'm hoping there will be less chance of burns if there is any accidental exposure on the ATV.

I'll admit, I didn't know what it would take to hook this thing up. On the description page on Amazon it doesn't mention how it connects and I didn't even think about it. As of 11/16 the product description shows"The Anzo USA LED 49-Inch 4-Function Universal Tailgate Light Bar improves safety by creating a more visible brakelight and adds style to any vehicle. It is universal in fit and is constructed with LED technology. This light bar fits RVs, trailers, trucks, and most SUVs. It provides brake light, left turn signal, right turn signal, and parking light functions. "It's important to note in order to install this you need a 4 flat pin connector from a trailer wiring harness. Because it didn't specify this I ordered it thinking perhaps it connected to my tail lights somehow. I know, I should have done my rearch ahead of time.) The product DOES come with instructions which clearly state this, it would be nice if they put a copy of those directions on the amazon product page not only for this product but all products amazon sells.But once I actually saw this thing operate it is really nice. The left/right and brake signals work perfect. It does dress the truck up and makes it stand out a bit.Overall good product, easy to install once you have the correct wiring on your vehicle.

Received the products in a timely manner.  Was a bit surprised to see that the left and right struts looked completely different (see review photos).  One looks exactly as pictured in the item photos on the listing, but on the other, diameter and shape of the bottom spring retainer was different, it had only a partial dust boot with a visible jounce bumper, the sway link tab was welded differently, and the retaining nut on the top had the strut shaft sticking up about 1" above the top of the strut mount rather than flush.  When compared to the OEM struts, one was spot on and one looked like it belonged on a completely different vehicle.I then went back to the listing and noticed that the two struts looked almost identical in the photos - but, a closer look shows that's because the item image pictured shows two of the same strut (not one of each, you can tell because of the sway link position, which are mirror images of each other in real life).I called Detroit Axle, and at first spoke with someone who appeared to already know that there have been complaints similar to mine - he even asked if this was for the "Torrent or Equinox" - so I'm not the first to wonder why the parts looked different.  He offered to verify if I would email pictures of what I received.  On the second call, I talked with a different person - she checked with a technician who, again, assured me that despite the difference in look - the fitment is correct and the struts would work fine and they were like this because they are sourced from different manufacturers.This may be the case - but, I really don't want one side of the vehicle to look different than the other.  In addition, struts are always supposed to be replaced in pairs to ensure that the balance between the left and right side of the vehicle is the same.  Not sure how you can guarantee a good "balance" and equivalent ride heights when the replacements come from two different manufacturers.  I ended up buying some KYB complete struts instead and returned these.  It's too bad, too, because the one that looked correct seemed to be almost an identical match overall to the OEM unit.Overall - the service from the company was good, and I can see that they carry quality products - but for this product in particular, I wouldn't recommend it as a replacement for anyone driving a Torrent, Equinox, or Vue until they get their supply chain in check and provide matching products for the driver and passenger side of the vehicle.

This window lift motor has been working fine and is a replacement motor on the drivers side window for my 1994 Ford F150 XLT.  Although, this Dorman 742-251 is designed to fit the passenger door window, it will work on drivers side window just has to be turned around whey you install it.  I matched this new one up with the failed Ford OEM motor and they are opposite.  You will need to drill out the 2 dimples with a 1/2 inch drill to get you nut driver in to reach the bolts on the inside of the door panel to remove the old motor.  There are 3 screws holding the old motor in.  One of the cables supplied in the package was a direct replacement and work great, snapped right in!  Had to switch polarity on the cable so up would be up and down would be down.  No big deal.  Overall, good buy!  Thanks!

Best unknown tool out there!!! After much research I found this tool! Saved me lots of time and money! Worked as intended in my 2002 F150 4x4 Pitman Arm. No need to pay $250-375 to mechanic, Took less than 45 minutes, no need to loosen or remove PS box just slide tool on lube up and go!

So the swap took less than an hour, an Allen wrench, 10mm wrench and flat head screwdriver took care of everything.I quickly noticed much better throttle response, and finally heard actual horsepower being produced while accelerating onto the interstate. Will soon be getting a more free flowing muffler soon. I would have to say that I totally recommend this intake!

Was excited to buy a premium sun shade but unfortunately this is about 4 inches short width wise (2" both sides) for the new 2017 highlander. Height is perfect but there is also a large cut out for the rear view mirror letting in sunlight. I bought this because I prefer the folding style compared to the  roll up ones. The material is of good quality and the construction is top notch but giving it 1 star due to the company advertising it to fit the 2017 is false and misleading and for wasting my time.  I am returning it. Amazon/manufacturer should really check their measurements before selling a product unless they like spending money on return shipping.

Extremely bright, not overly large (for compact housings), deep color.... couldn't ask for more. Also, they don't look overly goofy (as they are easily seen in my housings). Another benefit in my application is the amount of side-firing LEDs, which shine straight out. This would probably be good for any vehicles reflector lights too.Headlights are on in both pics, but camera was dimmed so make the lights visible  rather than just a large glare. These make the bike MUCH more visible by adding multiple colors to the front rather than just white headlights with white marker lights.

I've had the usual riveters but this one is really great!  Especially if you plan to use it for steel rivets and for more than one job.My findings:-Hedge clipper action, rather than plier action much easier!-Less hand fatigue, and can apply forward pressure while riveting-Easily handles steel rivets-Shanks are caught in removable chamber, making less mess-After 1000s of rivets, still grips well!  (not true of my previous $12 standard riveter which only lasted a few hundred)Helpful hints:-Point tool toward the sky to load, open and close to seat rivet.  After riveting, again point to sky and open to unload shank.-When riveting tight spots that don't have room for the head, stack washer or nuts on shank and apply tool to full stack.  That will give you the clearance you need to use the tool (I had to do this when trying to rivet a handle on a case.5 stars!

I just got a set of the Rola rack for my 2017 Tacoma crew cab 4x4 Sport long bed.  But I didn't like the color of the black paint so I repainted them with Aluminum paint so it's more a one tone.  I left the base Black so it would blend in with the bed.  Now it looks great except for the misalignment of the front set.  They fit, but noticed that one of the leg seem to be off, maybe the leg, or the base weld, which causes the rack to be placed 1-1/2" difference on the bed.  When I initially mounted the front base brackets at 6" front the head rail I could not install the top Rola rail without stressing the bars into place.  I may move it to the back to see if it still the same problem but for now I can live with it.  I so didn't use the corner bracing as it seems to be well secured.  I just thought of an idea to use the mounting screw to put a D-ring on them instead so that I can secure taller items like a referigerator up higher with my tie downs.  As for the two rail locks, they do work, as do the locks on the top aero bars.  But they are cheaply made and one has to be careful in inserting the key in the right direction and jiggling the lock to turn.  But they do work.  I also left out the plastic base covers I didn't see any purpose other than hiding the 5/8 nuts.  It's not going to stop water from getting into the bolts and nuts, so I decided to buy some plastic nut covers instead.  When I receive them in a few weeks, I plan on placing some non-hardening silicon into the cap and seal them on.  Hopefully it will have a cleaner look then the place cover.  If not, I will repainted the black plastic cover aluminum to match.But I do like how they look and so far no wind noise unlike my 4200xt Thule racks which is very loud on my other truck.

Seems to be working great, needed it to protect my CV boot from getting to hot after putting on an aftermarket downpipe on a turbo subaru baja. A few tips, like other said use light gloves and long sleeves. It does not really shed, so your face and head should be fine. Do your first few wraps, tighten down the clamp band, then as you wrap the pipe, twist the wrap back up to the beginning to make it evenly snug.  You will smell it burning off for the first hour or 2, after that the smell is gone.Also, don't pay attention to amazon, it tries to get you to buy the silicon spray with your wrap. The website says do not spray the titanium wrap, it has a coating built into it and does not need it, the spray won't properly be absorbed and will just burn off.

The last cold snap told me that I needed new batteries. I am not one of those guys that let it go until it will not start. Having said that, I was amazed how fast the Optimas spun the Cummins over. As far as longevity goes, we'll see. I registered them on Optima's web site. They sure look good in the truck. They come with all sorts of adapters and hold downs. That was very good for me as I was missing a hold down and had to drill the other bolt out.

Worked fine on my 99 tacoma 4x4 v6.  There's a very important trick to getting the shaft of the lever to go back far enough in order for the cable to pop out of place.In my first picture you can see what you have to remove. Not shown is a 10 mm nut that holds the ebrake sensor on.  You'll see it when you're in there. Remove the pin with a plier or pick,  push the big metal pin towards the passenger side. This will also make the little white wheel fall out. Remove the metal tab.  Use a flat head to pry it out then use a plier to squeeze the open end together a little. The new cable is a little smaller in that area, so this will allow the tab to firmly hold it in place.Now for the trick, look at my second picture.  It's a bottom side view of the emergency lever tube.  Now,  notice the two pins I circled? These hold on to the ratcheting mechanism you hear when pulling the ebrake. That mechanism stops the lever from going further into the tube. You will have to do this by feel,  so put your hand on the top part of that mechanism by the pins.  Pull the ebrake lever back SLOWLY and you'll feel two additional small metal thing sticking up.  Notice how it pivots back and forth with each ratchet? Push the two metal things forward (towards the engine) and with the other hand,  twist and push the ebrake lever down as if you're releasing it like normal operation.You should notice that this allows the shaft to go in further,  allowing the cable end piece to drop.Push everything down and most everything else should be common sense from the underside of the truck.Additional tips: this new cable end piece going to the back of the truck is bigger than the original. You'll see what I mean,  but it won't fit 100% so I just stuck a larger flat head in that holding piece and twisted it,  widening the gap.This end piece also has what seems to be a simple pin holding it in place,  almost exactly like the white wheel from up top. Mine was seized within the cable end piece.  It would not come up.  I had to put a 14mm short socket over it,  then used a C clamp to push it from the bottom up.  Again,  you'll have to see it for it to make sense.  Took me 2 hours.  Could be shorter with no rust and I had to figure out the ratcheting mechanism on my own.Good luck!

Carbon fiber vinyl doesn't come anymore realistic than this. This is a top notch product that'll turn a boring interior into something you'd see in an exotic sports car. You'll also save hundreds or even thousands of dollars by using this over the real carbon fiber. Real carbon fiber interior trim pieces don't make sense when it's only there to be visually appealing.

This is my second purchase of a Royal Purple oil filter through Amazong.com. Today, I am extremely disappointed in Amazon's quality control. I just opened my Royal Purple 20-59 oil filter to install in my 2011 Buick Lucerne to couple with the 5w30 Royal Purple oil... and there is oxidation on the interface panel of the filter and the threads are gunked up with a appears to be a combination of oxidation and maybe Royal Purple (from somebody pre-treating the threads). I would strongly advise against a future purchase on Amazon until they can check their stock at this point.Filter serial number 278-38129-0374. Manufacturing code 033115022:28 Made in the USA.

I have a tilt-gate trailer like the one they picture except it has 2-7/16" OD round tubular top rails, not flat rails.The yellow spring housings come in two pieces to allow a shorter shipping box. You butt them up and then bolt them down, two bolts for each piece of tubing.However, there's nothing to align the two yellow tubes together. Thus flat-bottomed square tubes are precariously sitting on top of round tubular rails. You are instructed to drill oversized holes through the mounting rails. This allows you to reposition the square tubes before tightening them down, but also allows the two tubes to move slightly as they absorb eventual road vibrations. The yellow spring housing tubes can become misaligned after a while. If that happens, the long garage-style springs inside the housing hang up on the misaligned tube edges in the middle and "boing" as they slip off.They should have welded ears onto the tubes that force the tubes to stay aligned or be hinged so that they are mechanically aligned after installation.Also, be aware that the threaded bolts are all metric. The carriage bolts look like they're 5/16-18 thread, and say so in the instructions, but they are not. The gate-mounting bolts look like they are 1/2-13, but they are not.The carriage bolts supplied are not long enough to go through my 2-7/16" tubular top rails. I had to purchase eight new galvanized carriage bolts (didn't want them to rust). That's when I discovered the threads were not SAE. The supplied nuts did not fit properly.One of the great features of this type of trailer is that you can fold the gate forward onto the bed to get it out of the wind for significantly less drag and better mileage. If you employ their permanently-attached cable system and its 6" long metric 1/2" bolts, you can never fold the gate inward -- the bolts make the gate too wide to fit inward.If you look at the pictures, you'll see that I rigged up a different system using shorter, custom-cut 1/2-13 threaded rod with locknuts, washers and a hitch pin. This allows me easily to remove the cables and still fold the gate inward on return highway trips when empty or lightly loaded. I now have the best of both worlds: an easy-lifting gate and an inwardly foldable gate.Finally, a word on the springs. Since they have no idea how heavy or large your ramp-gate is, they supply two coaxial springs that are really strong. Two springs, one inside the other for each side, comprise the default setup. This means you have five spring combinations to choose from.1. Both inner and outer springs on both sides, if your gate is really heavy.2. Both outer springs (no inner springs) on both sides, if the gate is heavy.3. One outer spring on one side, both inner/outer springs on the other side if the gate is a bit less heavy.4. One inner spring on one side, one outer spring on the other side.5. One inner spring on both sides.You test the gate using various combinations and S hooks until you're happy with the balance.The problem is that to get the springs apart so you can use only the inner spring, you have to cut the outer spring's loop and pull the larger outer spring off the pair. This renders the spring almost unusable if you change your mind.  It's a bit confusing in print. Weigh your combinations carefully before cutting.Out of the box and per side, you can attach the cable to 1) both springs or 2) the outer, larger spring. You can't attach to the just the smaller, inner spring by itself.Because my gate is fairly light, the combination I needed was a single inner spring on one side and one outer spring on the other side. I cut the large outer spring off with an angle grinder. You'd need a very large bolt cutter, or maybe a hacksaw, to cut the spring. But spring steel is very tough. Don't know if a hacksaw would make it.Anyway, now that the gate is balanced fairly well, it's simply a matter of picking it up with my toe and it rises easily into position to be locked off. Very handy indeed.

The product seems to be good quality but does not fit my 2013 BMW 535i even though one of the videos I watched was on a BMW (perhaps it was 3 series - couldn't tell from the video.The installation was a breeze but as I said, it doesn't fit. When installed as intended using the child seat hooks, it sits on top of the rear speaker housing. As a result, it leaves a gap (see photos).There is a 'flat' section behind the speakers - you can sort of see it in the photo I took from outside. The problem is that there isn't a way to use the recommended mounting there. Plus there isn't much room between the flat section and rear windshield - perhaps 4"-5" total space, 1.5" of which will be taken by the housing of this item. I will try to use the included screws (black wood screw) to screw it at that location but I need to get a very short Phillips screwdriver first. If that doesn't work, I may try to use velcro tape. When I do, I'll update this review.The other thing that is a bit less than ideal are the hooks they included. There were two types, one with very sharp pointy ends - I pricked my finger working with it. I opted to use the other type, with flatter ends. It installs on the end of the headliner easily enough. It's easy to hook the shade to the hooks but it's not that easy to take it off. I will use another solution in the end - I happen to have "Command Wire Hooks Value Pack, Small, White, 9-Hooks (17067-9ES)". I'll stick two of them on the windshield and see how they work.For those two reasons, I gave it 3 stars - mostly because it came fast, the materials seem to be very good quality and all the hardware was there.I'll update this review once I sort out the installation issue in my car.

I couldn't be more please with what I received for the price paid. What a bargain! The 3M double stick tape worked well on my 2007 Wrangler Unlimited. Super easy to install...just peel the backing off the tape and press into place. I did clean around the grill before installing to make sure there wasn't any wax residue, etc. Yes, there is a TOP and a BOTTOM to each piece but once you look at them and the grill it will become obvious which end is up. I really like the looks it gives to the grill. Like another reviewer said...it does stiffen up the grill but I think that is an improvement. Check out my before and after photos for reference.

These mounts are okay. Overall construction seems good enough, but they don't fit well on a 2" bar. I could not use the supplied bar wrap to protect the bars from getting scratched, I can't get them together if I do. If they fit a little better I would say 5 stars.  I'm using these to hold some LED lights on the rear of my cage. I feel a bit overpriced for what they are.

Just installed this on a 2007 Honda Odyssey. You need to remove the high side manifold on existing compressor,that is attached with 5.5mm bolts, and transfer the manifold over to the new a/c compressor. There was also two packing studs that I had to unscrew to fit the manifold in place. I removed the front tire and unbolted a cross member under the frame to gain access for removal and re installation. It was a VERY SNUG fit getting it by the frame members, but it worked like a charm. You will need to dump the shipping oil that comes inside the compressor. I attached  photo of the old dirty oil. Measure in the new oil. Evacuated the system and re charged with R134A. The a/c fired right up and is cooling really well. So far I would definitely recommend. I will update this after we have some hot weather....its March 2018 now.

Appear to be high quality.  Nice durable gloss finish.  Installed in my 2007 mazda 3.Like previous reviewers said, the brake line holder is small, so I used pliers to widen it up.  Besides that issue, these seem very good for the money.On a side note, I don't like how the sellers use images of monroe struts for the product page though.Will update with any issues.Update 3/15/16: After putting about a hundred miles through these on familiar commuting routes, I have to say that these are noticeably quieter than the OEM struts and transmit less vibration. Huge benefit.  These are also much firmer than the 10yr old set that these replaced, and the car doesn't lean at all in sharp turns. Revised my review from a 4* to a 5*, because I do love these struts, especially considering how much they cost.

Padded, easy to fit, there are NO straps/clips on this car seat protector meaning there are no breakables! A BIG plus! SO how does it stay in position and not slide all over the seat? If you look at one of my pictures you will see there is a big flap on the center back. Push this in between the top and bottom of your seat. The flap, approximately 7" deep, is thin apart from the last 2" which is padded to prevent the flap coming back out again.The actual seat and back are padded in quarters allowing this to fold up easily when not in use. Both top and bottom are the same size - approximately 19" x 16 1/2". On the front there is a storage pocket, a nice added bonus.Washable but please do not put in the dryer, let drip dry.Nice, quality seat protector. Would definitely recommend to others. Product provided in exchange for an honest review. Thanks, Liz

I'll start out by saying these are beautiful covers. Nice heavy vynyl with a nice black trim detail around the edge. They are really sharp looking. However the size they recommend for my size tires are just a little too snug.I have 205/75r14 tires. They measure exactly 26 inches in diameter inflated to 50psi. So I purchased the size that said up to 26.5 inches diameter. Based on the reviews and questions I figured I had a 50% chance they would fit correctly, although my gut said go with the next size. They arrived. While they fit, they are VERY snug and hard to put on. That would be OK as they will probably stretch in time. But they are also close to 3 inches too short on the tire and don't come to the ground so they don't protect the whole tire. I should have gone with my gut and bought next size. But the description clearly stated sizes. Buying based on the description gave me covers that are too small. Next size has been ordered. Too small size will be on its way back tomorrow once larger size arrives and in sure they fit. But if you are close to the limit on size it appears right choice is to go with next size up.-----------Update. The larger size (model #2) arrived today. They slide right on easily and come all the way to the ground on the 205 75r 14 tires. Maybe just a tiny bit too loose but better than being too tight and small. You can see in the picture how they look. It's cold in my garage. I'm sure the heat in the summer will unwrinkle them. But they fit on far better than the smaller ones that were just too snug and short. We shall see how they hold up over time.

Due note! You need the rubber mohawk from customtaylor in order to properly apply these reflective decals to your helmet! I made this mistake initially and had to wait about 5 days to add this to my helmet. (got the stickers friday, and realized i needed the mohawk saturday) Let me tell you though, IT WAS WORTH IT!! I really love these things, i got the bright red. they appear darker red in the light, but in the dark and if a light hits them just right, BAM!! Looks like an LED. I have had these on my motorcycle helmet for the last few months and all i get is compliments. Ive had friends who followed me in their car while i was riding and they say if i turn my head to check for a lane switch at night the whole strip lights up and catches their attention. I am really really happy with these, and the seller. Additional spikes are even included!

I used this on a Harley-Davidson Dana Wide Glide with Vance & Hines 2 into 2 Big radius pipe. I had enough of each roll to wrap the pipes from where the header heat shield and the muffler heat connect all the way to the head. I was able to overlap the wrap about 1/2 way instead of the 1/4 overlap they wanted. I felt that the more overlap would provide more heat protection. I have rode about 300 miles with this on my exhaust and I have noticed a reduction in the heat coming off my pipes. They do smoke for about 100 miles and then they still smell a little after 300 miles, but I love the look they added to my bike.Installing:First off if you can remove your pipes, I recommend doing so. I however did not and it made it a little challenging to paint the pipes afterwards, but with a lot of plastic and tape I got it done.1. PUT ON Rubber gloves (this helps with the Fiberglass itch and the black dye that will bleed if you wet the wrap) also put down something to catch the excess water run off. It will turn your drive way or garage black for a few washes if not.2. Soak the wrap (highly recommend this). I used a bucket and I put each wrap in the bucket about 10 mins before I started to wrap the pipes3. Take your time and wrap them tightly starting at the end of the pipe and working forward. (end meaning where you want the wrap to go from). Use hose clamps(2 1/4" is what I used) instead of the metal strips they give you. I was not able to get them tight enough to hold and I know hose clamps will not loosen up on me.5. Secure the start point with one of your hose clamps and start wrapping the pipe working forward and use the recommended overlap6. secure the end with another hose clamp ( I used two, which should help reduce fraying)7. if you removed the pipes Paint them with the provided spray (2-3 coats); if not tape up and cover bike, then paint them (2-3 coats)

The cover material is very good quality. The grommets not so, as soon as you pull to get the rope through the grommets to tie they pop off. No, I didn't pull hard, It did that on all 4 covers.

I own my first black car, wow is it hard to keep clean and shiny. This kit has everything for someone who wants to keep there are looking like it was just detailed by a pro.The car wash soap forms a lot of suds works great, really nothing negative about it,Clay kit I used a clay bar around the entire car, the clay looked in pretty good shape when I was done so I made sure to put it away in a tight zip lock so I can get more uses out of it. The box says use up to six times, BEWARE I almost dropped it on the ground, if this happens throw away.leather conditioner I love it, smells great and left the seats feeling so soft and smooth I just wanted to stay in my car and caress the seats, my wife hates this.car wax left me very impressed when on easy and came off even easier. I used it out in the sun did not leave any difficult to remove white residue best of all left an amazing shine, not sure about durability of wax. this is the first application.Top coat: just when i was already impressed by the great shine the wax left, the top coat brought and even better shine. I would use this if going out to a show or just really want to get that maximum shine out of the clear coat as possible,Spray wax: works great for a few days or week between waxes when you don't have time and want to restore that amazing shine again, quick spray and wipe down. using the WOWO method (wax on-wax off) left a great clean look on the door handles and hood.wheel and tire cleaner: couldn't be easier spray on let sit for a few minutes you can see all the break dust and grime coming off and spray hose off.Overall I think this is a great kit, brings pretty much everything you need. I think its a good brand, purchased separate from this brands it would have cost more. good bang for you buck.

*** UPDATE on 3-9-2017***Seller finally contacted me and asked for proof of purchase and pictures of the broken brackets.  I complied and seller sent me a link where I could buy replacement brackets for $7.99 and no offer to provide replacement under warranty. SERIOUSLY??? Needless to say, my rating of the product and seller remains one star and I will be buying a competitors complete equivalent 18W flood lights with heavier duty mounting bracket assemblies for cheaper than I paid for the Kawell.  So much for customer service these days... very disappointed.*** ORIGINAL REVIEW ***Cheap brackets broke within 6 months... installed on a seldom used John Deere riding mower/tractor and the vibration apparently brought out the weakness in the thin aluminum mounting brackets, which broke where the LED fixture attaches to the bracket. I wrote to the seller (Kawell) to see if I can get replacement brackets with no response so not only is the product poorly manufactured but the seller has lousy support and follow-up to inquiries.The LED's were bright and still working but again, with limited use so who knows how long they will last.I can not recommend either the product or the seller - buyer beware.

ordered "FH GROUP FH-PU008115 Perforated Leatherette Full Set Car Seat Covers, Airbag & Split Ready, Solid Black Color - Fit Most Car, Truck, Suv, or Van" as a fathers day present for my stepdad. packaged well and arrived fast. design is great and materials seamed to be OK. it came with 2 front seat covers, 2 back seat covers, 5 headrest covers, and ... 2 unknown pieces with zippers made for something round. while thinking what those 2 pieces are made for, we thoroughly inspected all covers and found two places on one seat cover where stitching came apart. i requested return and refund, but looks like my mom will put her sewing machine to work to fix that.this set was meant to be used on 2016 VW Jetta S. I have also 2016 Jetta SE and I use seat covers by kust purchased here on amazon (not available anymore) specifically made for my car. FH Group seat covers don't fit as good on Jetta since they're universal, but for 1/4 of the price of kust covers, this is a good deal.

I originally bought this thinking that it was much smaller.  I'd recommend taking a ruler and understand the size that you are buying.  That said, I have a 2010 Escalade that comes with huge mirrors and I ended up placing this in the bottom center of my mirrors and it works great.  It allows me to see MUCH more as vehicles are passing.  As the vehicle is coming up to my left, my main mirror catches them for the most part (and the secondary mirror doesn't really interfere).  When they get up close to my bumper, the secondary mirror picks them up very well and it doesn't really let them out of my view until they are near my front bumper.  The mirror is clear and the angle is great.  I'd definitely recommend this.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

I would of gave them a 5 but the piece for the front left fender is not cut to fit cleanly. It fits the JK emblem fine but as you can see in the photos it's to close on the bottom and to far away on the top where it lines up with the fender. There is no way to adjust it to make it look like it belongs there. It makes no sense because the one on the antenna side fits perfect and this should be it's mirror Image. Quality control needs to fix this. At first I didn't think I'd like the painted rivets but they look fine-in fact I don't think I'd like them as much if they were just plain.

Worked 100% as I hoped it would.  Solid build, easy to set up/adjust, and quite a few different ways to hook up your specific engine.I had the whole front subframe off the car and didn't give a second thought to working on my back beneath this support brace.  I got lucky and was able to use a single hook; no need for dual hooks or chains etc.  However I like the fact that it can adapt to other cars I need to work on in the future.  Foam protected the inner fenders well during the job.Happy I made the purchase.

Overall these aren't bad. They have a good beam spread. Don't take a lot of current to run, and are plenty bright.  I was surprised actually at how bright.  At first they appear to be well made, however I broke four of the twelve, just by finger tightening them.  No wrench. Just my fingers.  The other four were fine.  It appears that the threaded barrel is only glued into the rim of the light housing.  Something more durable to interface the two pieces of metal would be recommended.  Making them from one piece of metal would be even better. Given this fragility, I have to take two stars away.I really like these for the light output and beam, but the part where they break isn't very endearing. So overall I'm neutral on these. I got the job done, since I had extra.  If didn't have extra, I would have been quite upset.Of note, these will get very hot if not mounted into something metal for heat dissipation.  In free air the case of the light is 130-190F depending on voltage. After mounting them into the metal rear bumper of my truck, they stay cool to the touch, reaching around 75F.Some measured specs:0.24A @ 14.7 volts.  Temperature in free air: 190F!0.15A @ 12.0 volts.  Temperature in free air: 130F.Beam pattern is 90 degrees.

When the original plastic door holder on our travel trailer broke we started shopping for a new and sturdier one. Richard was able to attach this JR Stainless Steel one using the same holes. It is a little tricky/tough to get the T-bar into the hole due to the angle of the door in relativity to the side of the trailer. HOWEVER the old one which was easy to get in was ALWAYS getting blown out by the wind which was a pain. Once this new one is in place, the wind cannot move it thus keeping the door open!Important to note that Richard covered the screws and edges in clear silicone caulk for extra protection. The door stop (white plastic tube) sticking out does NOT come with it. That was on the old one to stop the door banging back against the side of the trailer so we transferred it onto this one. Thanks, Liz

This turned out to be the perfect frame for me.  I have an all black car and I wanted a frame that would transition well from the blackness of the car to an all white plate.  The frames that have larger bottoms (presumably to cover up the unused holes) are too obtrusive probably because of their imbalance or lack of symmetry.  The thickness of the bottom also makes it more likely for people to notice that the black on your car and the black on the frame are two different shades of black. In other words, you simply notice the presence of those frames too much, IMO.  This frame blends well with my car's glossy black paint.  The two small holes remain at the bottom but I plan to cover them by inserting white eraser tips into them.  This frame does not include black screw caps, so I had to buy them separately.  I'm very happy with the results.  I used to have a chrome frame and this one looks so much better!  BTW, nobody asked me but I do NOT like the antique CA license plates which are all black with yellow numbers.  TOO MUCH CONTRAST between the black and the yellow numbers!  When I see an all black car with one of those plates, the only thing I notice are the license plate numbers.  The car itself becomes featureless and the numbers stand out dramatically - the exact opposite of what you want.  And that yellow color they use goes with almost nothing.  I'm sure there are times those plates would work (like maybe a Steelers tribute car) but most of the time it just seems like the person is trying to get their car as black as possible and it falls short.

Used this to highlight a hitch mounted step. It works great.I had some left over so, I put it on the inside edge of the door so that in the unfortunate event that I have the door opened on the side of the road, it will be more visible to fellow motorist. I've included a pic but, white on white in the daylight will be difficult to see.

I installed this today and satisfied. It works great and I like this soft and smoothly open the tailgate.When I tried tightening nutsert 9 spins, it was still loosen. And I read other review. He got problem as same as me. He said his nutsert hole shape was oval. And he tightened 30-50 spins. Not 9 spins. It was very helpful for me. So I tried more spins untill got tightened. And then other work easily after this first step.The thin clear tape can reduce body damage and protect from hard rubbing. The instruction picture images are helpful. If you need more it, 3M packing tape is works too. And you can adjust the wire guard from 3 and half inches to any place.

I've had tons of leds from the first day they came out and like always JDM astar amazes me. I have their extreme leds for my brakes and turns all the way around and these are just as great of quality of led. I love that they are white without any blue hue. When I open my doors at night I feel like the heavenly gates have opened. Only downside is now I need more. Tons more. Would and will buy again and totally would recommend.

I have a 2014 Jeep Wrangler and was in need of new lights, I then decided to purchase these HIDS Kit. It took me around 45 minutes to install, due to the relay harness and lack of space behind the housing. After I installed my HIDS, I noticed a huge difference. The only down side is my Jeep is lifted, so on coming traffic will be quite pissed, because I didn't point my headlights down. Lol.

I love this shield! I paired this with a 3/4 Dull Black Dayton Cruiser helmet and I love it. The shield is perfect for daytime riding. I love the retro look of it. It does rattle a little when you let air get under it by lookup upward, but if you are looking straight forward it is just fine.BE CAREFUL when removing it from your helmet. The snaps fit tightly and you can break them when removing the shield. I would recommend using a small flathead screwdriver to pop the snaps when taking this off.

Put these on some HFP wheels to make it a little harder to remove. It may not 100% stop someone, but it will make it harder than just using a 19mm. Dealership wanted +20$ for this exact set so I came to Amazon. They sit perfect @ 80ft/lbUPDATE FEB-2017:Bought these in SEP of 2016. I take really good care of my car/wheels and even throughout the winter I rarely drive it/wash it regularly. I noticed all four are starting to rust.

This is a great product! The kit comes with everything you need. My shipping tube was damaged and missing parts but they gladly sent what was missing. I just realized I was suppose to get fuse adapters with the kit too but I just tapped in to an existing fuse adapter.The LEDs are nice and bright! The kit comes with a standard remote and a keychain remote. The keychain remote doesn't work without turning the unit on with the regular remote. Once it's turned on with the regular remote, you can turn everything on/off, change the colors and modes for some time.I will say the cords are a bit short to run the the rear of a truck. You can't run the wire for the rear light through the firewall. You have to run it from the unit, to a grommet in the back of the cab, down through to the back. Or buy another extension cable.All in all, this is a great add-on to your vehicle. Everyone loves it!Bought a second kit to add but only added 2 of the 36" and it's great! Everyone still loves it. Happy with OPT7. Great customer service!

Installed it on my 2003 Rubicon.I can see where it could really be challenge installing this lock without the right couple of tools, it's kind of tight between the grill slots.I used two 1/4" ratchets, one on top and one up through grill with an extension and a small inspection mirror.Use a small piece of tape to hold your nut and washer to your socket when feeding it up through the grill.You need to need to pop out the little wiring harness hold down for the new bolt first.Insert the nut, washer, socket & extension up through the grill slot and line it up on the underside of the bolt hole and and drop in your bolt, so easy, also make sure you don't pinch the wires between the grill and your new hood lock.Installed my new lock in less than 10 min.Take your time on the final alignment, this where the mirror comes into play, look up through the grill slots and observe the latching action and positioning of how it works, just cinch it up lightly at first and try it before final tightening. I could see if you don't do this you could get yourself locked in or out or all bound up with the alignment, then you'll just find yourself inventing new swear words !!I soldered like a 1" extension onto the head of my key as my big fingers barely fit between the grill slats, let alone trying to turn the key inside of the grill, this allows me to turn the key from outside the grill, so much easier.....I have more peace of mind now when my toy is outside at night or even just at the store.Have fun and keep on Jeepin......

Today I am reviewing the TUNNKIT LED Warning Canceller & Noise Canceller for H11, H8, H9 LED Headlight Conversion Kit-CANBUS Adapter for BMW, VW, VOLVO and More. I installed some LED headlights in my 2012 Dodge Grand Caravan and they were flickering. I ordered these to solve that issue. These worked great. In some never cars there are multiple computers and if the computer see's an anomaly in the wattage going to the lights they flicker trying to correct themselves. These trick the car into thinking there is a standard set of headlight bulbs in the car. Installation is a snap. You simply disconnect your wiring harness from the bulb and then connect these between the bulb and the wiring harness. If you ordered the right set for your vehicle it is plug and play and should take 5-10 minutes to install.Whats in the package:2 - CancellersPros:Easy to installStops the flickeringSmall compact designCons:None

I purchased it from another seller on Amazon. Mine came with no hardware, the seller helped me out. No problem with the seller RevPlanet. Great customer service.I was able to install the door part by myself. My only issue was the wrangler retard star bolt that circles easily. Beware on that. Make sure the "T-40 torque socket is steel. I easily circled the one I had that wasn't. Anyway I had to drill out three out of four of the lower door hinge bolts. That took about two hours.Product issue I have so far is the rear bumper area (search for "SRC installation manual" and you'll see what the parts are) It'll piss you off. You'll need a metal grinder which I plan to use tomorrow to remove the welded on stock bolts... I do not trust just bolting on the rear uprights on the stock bolts because the nut does not tighten all the way..Also if you plan to bolt using the stock welded bolts on the rear bumper, you'll have to drill bigger holes on the rear uppers..roof rack, I took a picture of that. They do not align..the bolts they provide does work it took some time for me to make it happen.Also the "rubber" gaskets they give you will stick and doesn't remove easily.. They're more like foam gaskets, they're not rubber. They tear easy.If you have the tools and patience maybe go for the SRC roof rack or save up and get something else. I'm stuck with it, it's not "easy" as bolt on as issues presented itself to me. I hope I'm able to finish it tomorrow..Update: the bolts that are spot welded on the bumper. I got annoyed and let some frustration out on it with a hammer. If you hit it for a while in different directions it will eventually pop out. I had an issue with one bolt.. The last bolt to remove of course.. I had to use a crow bar and hammer. "Placed the crow bar in the bolt and hammered the crowbar".When finished I didn't hear any issue with the roof rack rattling since I took my time tightening each bolt. I would jump on it and shake it a bit then tighten them all and repeat until i could no longer tighten them and the SRC roof rack felt solid.An issue I had with the product was the roof rack rubber cap for the crossbar. Great idea but it's garbage. The bolt is metal and the covering that holds the bolt is plastic.The bolt would not tighten since it will grind the plastic away. I ended up removing the bolt and disregarded the handle. If the handle was all metal on metal I believe it would work. I will have to check out Home Depot for a bolt that makes it easy to bolt on and off the cross bar when I was my soft top down.Also at 40+ mph the cross bars will sound a bit like a hurricane lol. I plan on fixing the hum noise from the wind.I'll try and to add extra pictures tomorrow.

Works well. I had to space out the passengers side to fit my light bar. I also added extra washers to give it more clearance from my windshield. I added some rubber on the bottom of the mount, where it touches the windshield. But I like the look and so far, it holds the light in position, so I am happy with it.

Just like everyone does clothes, try the inserts in the slots before you remove the tape on the back. If you do this you will have a great fitting.

Ok, this is the first time I have ever spray painted vehicle trim but I do have general spray paint experience. I used it on the bottom part of a plastic rear bumper which was this really weird, faded and weathered grey color that should have been black all along. It came out a matte black which matched the other trim on the vehicle. No one would know I did it myself unless they got right up onto the seams or did this kind of work. It is certainly passable for the road and was preferable to purchasing a new black bumper for an old car.I wanted to do it in my garage (with the doors open) so the breeze wasn't a factor and used about 5 big plastic drop cloths all over the place. I was sure to cover anything I didn't want black. I did not use primer, I just cleaned it and made sure it was dry. The nozzle was a little different from what I was accustomed to, typically spray paint comes out in a circular "O" shape but this came out in a vertical "I" shape. Since I was going from a light grey to a dark black, I used 3 coats. I let it dry for an hour and a half between sprayings (this was just a random choice I made, the can says nothing about this) but it was dry to the touch 10 or 15 minutes later when I touched it. I could have probably put another coat on it but the difference was so drastic I was very pleased. There is an area where I let it run on the second coat, it's not very noticeable but I know where it is so I see it. The can is pretty big, you can get a lot of use out of it, I have plenty left over. I also used one of those spray gun handles which are a must for working with spray paint and made the job a lot less tedious. I used frog tape on the seam of  the metal with the plastic bumper and then just masking tape on top of that to hold the drop cloth in place. I took the tape off an hour and a half after the final spraying. Everything looked clean. I let it dry over night and drove it the next day although the can says it reaches full hardness in 48 hours.So far it is holding up, it completed the look and took away a noticeable distraction. Hopefully it doesn't wear off during the winter and summer. Considering I really didn't know what I was doing and if you exclude the time waiting between coats and covering everything before hand I probably only did about 10 minutes of unskilled work so I'm very satisfied with the results and return on investment. It's worth a shot.

Its nothing like what you see in the picture. I bought it for my company. Its pink in color. The description for the item is not clear. When it says pair its not 1 right and 1 left. Its 2 right side ones. You could find this item $40 less for each Go-jac. I lost $160.  I contacted the TCP. They are no help. And also the pin which holds down the stepping pedal is missing in one of them.Please don't get fooled by this TCP.

I was nervous to purchase this due to reading everyone's comments about moisture and issues but figured I could remedy most issues. So here are my observations. 1. This is bright but not as high of a wattage as advertised. I check amp draw even at 20 volts and it still didn't add up. 300 watts over 12 volts is 25 amps. This only went to 16 amps. At 20 volts (i don't recommend this) using an industrial voltage generator, I got 17.5 amps. 2. There is a section where the lights aren't as bright, must be from wiring or a change in vendor for their light pods. Every group of 4 has their own section of separate circuit board. You can see in one of the photos it's hard to notice. Not an issue but just an observation. 3. I planned on using silicone to seal up the bar to prevent moisture, however, there is sealant in there already. It's been in the rain 2 days and still going strong with no moisture inside. 4. Minnesota requires all lights above 42" above the ground to be covered when on the road. I didn't know this till post install, so if you buy this for your vehicle that will be on the road you'll need a cover of some sort. Even duct tape will work to avoid a ticket. Also this puppy is bright, like super bright but it floods light rather than spot lights. I have two hella 500's in that have 135W bulbs in them and they'll spot beam almost 300 yards away while the light bar just blinds everything within 100 feet or so. I hope this review helps someone for purchasing.

Very bright. Color was white without any noticeable hint of blue. Had to make a slight modification so that the bulb fit into the housing.

These things are fantastic. Super bright, look great, and seem well made. As of now, I will just wait and see how long they do last, but I would for sure buy again. I included two pictures to show the brightness. These are basically like having two headlights in the taillights.

I was able to use this to fill my m50d transmission and rear differential case on my little ford ranger.  It worked on both 'types' of bottles as well (pictured).  Also, I added a piece of vynil tubing to the feed tube to reach the bottom of the taller bottles used for the rear differential gear oil, also pictured.

Purchased this for my 2016 Jeep JKU, Wasn't sure to go with this 8,500 or a 9,500 winch. Decided on the 8,500 as it weighs around 22 lbs less than the 9500 at around 72 lbs. Going to replace the wire rope with synthetic rope to save a little more weight plus it is safer. Should be more than enough to get me out of just about any situation I might get into.Very easy install as the solenoid is already placed and wired on the side of the winch. Just had to bolt it to the front bumper and run the wires to the battery.I didn't use the supplied hawse as I already had an aluminum one on my bumper, The supplied one is painted black and is pretty heavy.Connected the remote control and it started right up.Looks to be nicely made.

These HID's are amazing! So easy to install with the 55w slim ballasts and they are affordable!! If you buy the full kit it comes with instructions. You can even keep the same ballasts and change bulb sizes when you switch cars. Exactly what I did.

This stuff is amazing. I've always had trucks where the cosmetics are too far gone to really care about keeping up on washing and waxing and stuff. I used to use ArmorAll on them, but I wanted a better quality product now that I have a flawless truck! After doing some research, I came upon this. My truck is a '14 F150 in Tuxedo Black Metallic. This stuff really makes it pop and gives it a mirror finish (literally). I'm not sure what this product does to get it to look the way it does, but I love it. Can't say enough good things about this product. I follow the directions for dilution and whatnot and the outcome is perfect. For whatever reason those directions are not on the label, had to look them up online. I wouldn't use any other product on my truck. This in addition to Collinite 845 wax keeps it looking great!

Finally installed the light bar. Had it in storage for about 6 months. Life gets in the  way of what we want to do the most. Anyway, this light bar turns night into day. Very bright and sturdy. The curved light bar allows the light to really fan out. Very happy with the brightness. This kit does not come with its own on off switch. You will have to purchase a separate kit or piece one together from your local hardware or automotive store. I recommend purchasing the kit. It makes installation so much easier and quicker. However, now for the bad news. This light bar is not water proof and not very resistant. About three weeks after installing, I took my truck through a car wash and now there is permanent water fog inside the lens. I HIGHLY recommend using either black or clear sealant around the bolt holes and any other gaps where the housing comes together with the face plate. Also, depending on the location and method you want to use, the mount kit that comes with this is not complete. If mounting onto a bar and you do not want to drill into your bar, I recommend buying light bar clamps. Makes mounting so much easier. Measure the length of the bar or other mount before purchasing the light. Take into consideration the added mounting hardware you will be using. If mounting on a bar, do not measure any curves, bends, or angles of the bar for mouning. Just the straight bar. The curve may not work well with your mounting kit.Oh, I gave this only three stars due to the water I now have inside the light bar. NOT COOL!

Guess I was the unfortunate one...somebody's gotta be I guess.  This product has great reviews,  didn't see a single review where one was broke on arrival but mine was.  The measuring pin was separated,  guess it was NVR connected right,  I requested a refund.  I might buy another when I send this back,  its just such a hassle to send stuff back when it arrives broken.  I hate going to ups and printing the labels and all that madness.

I purchased this to insulate the inside of my 1993 Honda CBR1000F fairing.  It gets hot riding in stop and go traffic in Chicago, and I needed something to help keep the engine heat off my legs.  This product fit the bill perfectly.  I cut pieces to fit on the inside of my fairing to reflect engine heat away from my legs.  The adhesive sticks well and the product works as advertised.  Very happy with it.

This ABN Clay Bar Mitt works great. I felt a small amount of contamination on my paint, but not severe enough where it needed to be clay bar'd the old fashion way. So I gave my Impala a hand wash and rinse.  I simply applied some shampoo suds to the panel and wiped it using 4-5 passes. Any stuck on contamination came right off with no difficulty. Seems to be gentle on the paint, similar to the fine grade Nano Sponge. The ABN Clay Mitt Is a perfect size, as it fits well in the hand and is easy to control. It only took about 40 minutes to do my entire full size car and it left a super slick contamination free surface. I'm impressed.UPDATE... Ive had this product for almost a year now and have used it 4-5 times. Still performs great. I have found that using Purple Power Vehicle & Boat Wash from Walmart is not only a great lubricator for the ABN Towel, it also helps strip away waxes and sealants to prepare the surface for polishing or protecting. Fantastic product!

Ordered product for my 2012 F-250 Super Duty, Super Crew Cab.  All parts where OEM.  Everything you need to install the product is included.  Installation is quick and easy took about 45 minutes.  Finding the harness truck side took some time,  on my truck it is on the bottom of the radiator support below the fan shroud.  If your truck has some miles on it I would recommend picking up 6 fender mounting U nuts, the kit comes with new bolts, but I found my fender u nuts to be a bit tired, luckily I had some on hand.  The instructions will mention needing programming, I simply installed all the components and flipped them on, everything worked just fine.

Cons: Did not fit my 2016 JK Jeep Wrangler as it said.  Advertised as being able to stay on with top.....you can, but it's a pain to get the latches latched back.  Two corners of the sunshade would not secure with the bungee cords they gave.  (Will include pics.)Pros:  It did help keep the Jeep cooler.  We were in Gatlinburg with 91 degree heat, and it kept the sun off us and made it a bit cooler.  Wish it fit better.Will be returning this to find something that fits better.

The product seems pretty good, one pice had a small chip on arrival but not the end of the world. Install is tedious and they should have lock tight, I will be adding it soon. The fit is very tight if not touching your grill. So if you are worried about scratching the paint on the grill.. You might. Once it is on it looks great.

I ordered this about a month ago and used it when i changed the oil in my 2000 jeep wrangler 2.5 liter . It was sealed correctly and it was full, so as far as the complaints others had i didn't have those problems. Obviously It's hard to tell if there is any difference internally but it does seem to run smoother and quieter. I will be purchasing this again and will be adding it to my wifes 2009 ford edge.

Extremely bright, love that the color matches the rest of the white led's that I have replaced in my vehicle.Edit:9-21-18I put these in my license plate lights and for the past 3 weeks they have been flickering every day. And by flickering, I mean more like a strobe light. Very annoying and both of then are doing it.For the H13 F-16 Headlights I also bought...I put a set of H13 bulbs in my 07 Yukon and they are a nice bright white,  but the throw isn't as much as I had hoped and the high beams are completely useless. The low beams are brighter than the high. And unlike some of Auxbeams other models, there are NO alternate holes on the adapter that screws into the headlamp so that you can rotate the bulb and position it as best as possible. I'm assuming this is why I have the issue that I do with my bulbs.But I've had them for almost a year and never had any issues with them other than what I've described above. My girlfriend wants a set for her 07 Mustang, but once I realize that her car takes the exact same bulb I figured I'd wait until after I contacted Auxbeams customer service and see if they can offer any solutions. Pictures are a Before and After, LED Vs. HalogenI will update if and when I get a response.

Package arrived with everything stated it would. There is now way enough air tubing unless you can install both horns and the motor all within a 1" of each other. I had to buy more tubing to get it installed which gave me more flexible locations where to install them. They are loud and work great.

Because I sometimes had to shade the speedo on my 2017 Road King with my hand in bright sunlight, I figured this might be a good solution. It does indeed help, though occasionally it shades too much, making it more difficult to see the speedometer numbers around the 12 o'clock position. Nonetheless, advantages outweigh any drawbacks, plus it looks good and seems to be well made. It's also easy to install with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/3M-Double-Sided-tape/dp/B01IHMK9G2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">3M Double-Sided tape</a>&nbsp;(why was a short strip of tape not included?).

I'd give this ten stars if I could. After reading the negative reviews I decided to give it a chance anyway because it's non toxic. I used it on a motorcycle gas tank that was rusty inside (Honda mb5). Filled it up, left it 24hrs and filtered the stuff as I dumped it out and it got a ton of junk. I was satisfied with the results, but you can't really see all that well inside a gas tank opening so the true effect was still unknown to me. Just so happened I have a Honda moped I'm working on at the same time. The engine was siezed hard, and when I pulled it apart the crank shaft was totally rusty. I decided to test the solution on the crank. In the pictures the one of the rusty crank looks like grease. That's only because of the penetrating oil sprayed in to free up the engine. It is solid scaled rust that could not be wire brushed off. I placed in the solution that had previously been used for the motorcycle gas tank overnight..that's right used solution. Today when I checked it I am absolutely amazed the results. I cannot believe someone created a water based non toxic environmentally safe solution that can achieve these results. No I'm not paid, no I didn't get any free product, I am just reviewing because of the fantastic results. Very easy to see in the pictures how deep tge crankshaft was suspended in this liquid and the part cleaned off was by far the worst.  10 stars

Draws over 1.2A continuously when unlocked because the main coil is normally open. Locked, draw is around 8 mA (< 1W). This will kill your battery if left unlocked for any considerable time, so it's basically worthless.Also, the manual's English needs spell check.

I have one lens leaking water every time it rains. I sent them a email by way of them wanting feedback, have yet to hear from them. The other 3 pieces are good. This same lens didn't fit into the clips very well, had to tye wrap one side to hole it in place. It is the driver side turn signal lens assembly. At this point and time, I would not recommend this item due to customer service.

I purchased my set on Ebay, only because they came with a 10 year warranty there. My only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is the side posts are slightly longer than oem, so if your retaining clips have a dome end, you have to cut it off in order for the light to slide in all of the way. I have owned Spyder and Anzo lights, and i feel as though these are of better quality.

Bought this for my 2012 Harley Dyna Super Glide Custom. Took about 5 minutes to re-program the ECM using blue tooth connected to my smart phone. Wow what a difference, bike runs great and has absolutely no popping or backfiring when decelerating or down shifting. Dont know what my local Harley dealer would charge to re-map the ECM but I bet it would be more than what I paid for this unit and I can use it again if I need to change anything with new pipes or hyper-charger or anything else that can affect the air fuel mixture and the bikes performance and fuel mileage.

When I purchased my '17 Crownline 215SS and decided that I would be storing it in my driveway though the summer, I wanted to have two security devices on the trailer hitch preventing someone who decided they needed my boat more than I did from trailering it away.  I bought the Master Lock locking hitch pin to go through the lock holes on the hitch, and that was good, but wanted something in the ball hitch.This product installs quickly and easily to a 2" ball hitch.  Once you lock the hitch mechanism over the ball, you can slide the yoke over, securing the whole hitch.  I like that you don't need to have the key in the lock mechanism to lock it.  I have other locks that work like that and it's a pain.This product is a nice piece of insurance, in conjunction with the locking hitch pin.  It is well made and is visually deterring.  Keep in mind that if someone is determined enough and has enough time, they can steal anything.  This would definitely slow them down.  Nice product.

This is a really decent stand for the price. Is it super-well-built, amazing quality? No. Does it do the job adequately at a reasonable price. Yes. I bought this to use with my 2014 Yamaha FZ-09 and I'm very satisfied with the purchase. Took a few minutes to assemble it, and I had to order the spools (which I got on fleabay for $7) but this works just fine. It's stable and looks good. I got free shipping with Prime to Alaska so that was an added bonus. Here are a few pics of my bike and stand. And if anybody is wondering, most Yamahas take 6mm spools.

I have Supertones on 3 vehicles now!  They are loud and very directional.  I wouldn't suggest putting these in a fender or pointing to the side or it will be muffled.  These should be right out front pointing straight out!  If they are installed that way they will definitely get someones's attention.  The pic I attached is where I just installed them on my '08 F-150.

The product description explicitly states that the wires coming from the relay harnesses are 12" long. However, the ones that came with mine are 4" long. The product description also makes no mention that the wiring on the fuse housings is 10 gauge-- this makes it inappropriate to be used with these relay harnesses wire which is 14 gauge. The only reason I give this 2 stars and not 1 is because I can still get some use out of the relays and harness.

Add me to the list of folks trying not to spend $300-500 on some fancy retrofit Morimoto projectors because I don't have the coin for that.  I'm sure they have top of the line build quality.  Being my first attempt at doing a retrofit projector project on my '02 Toyota 4Runner, I wanted to make sure I wasn't throwing away $$$ if something went wrong.  That being said, I bought:- these Nilight 2.5" Mini HID Bixenon Projector Lens for H1 Bulb Car Gift:chrome Shround ($26)- H4 Relay Harness For Bi-Xenon Hi/Lo Xenon HID Conversion Kit ($15)- Kensun HID Xenon Conversion Kit "All Bulb Sizes and Colors" with Premium Ballasts - H1 - 5000k ($60)Total: $100, and you'll be surprised the bang for your buck!  Plus, you don't have to do any extra drilling or cutting on your headlight housings!They come with chrome shrouds.  I color matched mine with the 4Runner's stock paint (KF9 Thundercloud Metallic). Necessary? No.  But I had all weekend to watch paint dry. -Lucky me-

I was asked if I would provide a honest assessment of this aftermarket brand air filter and I agreed under the preface that all types of feedback must be welcomed. With that requirement of mine met, a free sample was sent to me to test out. Here is what I found:The current price is under twenty bucks and I can be pretty sure that there is no way in the world a dealership would come close to matching one air filter for the price of these two, let alone 2 filters. Like non name brand water filters for refrigerators, I am thankful they are out there; provided they do their jobs.This package came clearly marked with instructions (not hard and online searching is additional help). These are a great fit and seem to do what the original filter did...make the air better. This is especially necessary in Florida where the pollen levels are ridiculous even in the Fall sometimes.The filter was easy to find, remove and replace. I especially like the arrow showing which direction to put the filter in as the last thing I want to do is have to mess with a newer vehicle (I don't like to change much on them but this is one thing I will). This was super simple and it seemed to do just as well. I'll have to check on it in a few months to see how it faired.Overall, I absolutely recommend checking out the other brands beside the dealership as their prices are so incredibly inflated!!

I really had high hopes for this product when adding it to my cart. I typically use an old tag to apply tire shine and end up getting the brownish oils under my finger nails which is really hard to get out. When I went and used this after receiving it yesterday, I quickly realized how it was just a waste of money. After shining just two tires I noticed the foam pad was already starting to tear. After shining all 4, the foam is ready to break apart and disintegrate. Definitely a major disappointment especially since Chemical Guys usually only sell quality products. Glad it was only 4 dollars, but at least now I know how bad these are.Update:This product works really well on street car and SUV tires, but just did not fare very well on my very aggressive offroad BFGoodrich KO2 tires on my Nissan Xterra.  The only other issue that I'm encountering is that the glue holding the foam in no longer holds after maybe 10 uses, so occasionally the foam will fall out and needs to be pushed back in during use.  Annoying, but not a huge deal.  I updated to 3 stars from 1 star since it does work well on other tires, but the adhesive did not last terribly long and the foam continues to tear.

Despite what the Amazon vehicle checker says this is the correct rear wiper blade for "some" 2011 Volvo XC60s.This is a replacement for Volvo part 30747762 / 31333449 used on later 2011 XC60s and other years. Amazon will vector you to the early 2011 blade style that doesn't fit.Look at the attached picture...if your rear wiper has the bent arm it uses this "Late Style" snap claw replacement. If you have the "Early Style" straight arm try the Valeo R16C or similar.This Bosch replacement is good quality and works well but, as the photo shows, doesn't fill the arm cutout as closely as the OEM part. This has no effect on its ability to wipe the window though! Overall I'd buy this again.

It is made from metal, too soon to tell if it will last, but seemed solid enough.  Paint was OK, not great, top of goggles was missing some black don't know if it will rust there.  Overall a great buy and looks really cool.  Comes with mounts for 1 inch and 2 inch hitches.

Bought this without much hope that it would really work, but it far exceded my expectations. I was trying to remove ugly boat registration stickers off a waverunner I just bought and nothing was working. These things were just not coming off. The letters and numbers were the kind you would use on a mail box or maybe a building. 5 min per side and they were gone! Seriosly easy. I used a variable speed drill, very little pressure and a slow RPM.

Installed on my DRZ. Used the factory fuel line and factory spacer block. Fit fairly well (slight pinch to the fuel line, but doesnt seem to affect performance. I would consider getting a fuel line elbow joint, though). Fuel flow is fine and the bowls fill up in about 15 seconds. This means that even at WOT the petcock will provide ample fuel. Just be sure to get a vacuum plug kit to plug the vacuum line nipple on the far side of the carb, or you'll run into a serious lean state,  that could damage your motor. Over all, for the price, this is an awesome fix, while I source parts for the stock petcock.This fit fine on the stock fuel line, I'm not sure what that other reviewer is talking about. This is worth the money while you fix the factory petcock.You can see the slight pinch just past the petcock in the image I uploaded. It's not bad, but it does bother me.

I thought that this part number was a 10 pack (gates website seemed to indicate that) but no it is single clamp. My bad for not inquiring before buying. But none the less not satisfied with Gates quality on this one. The one I received had a manufacturing defect of about 25% of the clamp on the inside was so I did not use. I think the concept is pretty cool but way to expensive, constant tension clamps are much cheaper. Also, if you install one of these you will probably end up cutting the hose to get the clamp off. I would only recommend this for a show vehicle or specialty applications. Not practical for normal automotive needs. Bottom line: Gates needs to improve quality and reduce the price on these before I will bother with them again.

I haven't had this hose for very long, but I've taken it on a few cold weather camping trips and have been pretty happy with it.  The hose has survived a couple hard freezes without cracking and seems to be made pretty well (I really like the stainless steel fittings) - the water doesn't have any funky taste coming out of it either.  The reason I've subtracted a star is because the hose tends to kink pretty badly, and I found that in the cold weather it was almost impossible to un-kink because the hose gets very hard and rigid.

I've been a Meguiar's user since 1972. I find all of their products perform extremely well and for a reasonable price. Yes, there are so many new and improved products out there and I've tried my share of them. But I always seem to migrate back to Meguiars. This synthetic spray is amazing to work with. Easy to apply and remove and the slippery finish it leaves is the best I've seen. If the vehicle has been properly prepared, the depth of shine and protection this provides is top notch.

Very impressed with the fact the components are sealed in a solid chunk of epoxy. In theory this should make the unit impervious to shock, vibrations and moisture/fuel. Time will tell but first impressions are excellent.Although a sticker on the housing says made in indonesia the packaging states engineered & assembled in the US.I installed on a Honda HRC216 commercial mower & it works perfectly.I recommend this product

I waited a bit before writing this review. Initially I did not like these. But now I really like them.Installation on my 2016 tacoma was easy. Loosen the u bolts, remove the factory bumpstop, install the sumospring mounting plate, torque the u bolts. I found the torque for the 2016 tacoma rear axle ubolts online. It's 52 ft lbs. I torqued mine to 58. Once bracket is installed then screw down the sumospring to the mounting bracket using the blue loctite included pitting a decent amount on the sumospring mounting screw which is welded to the plate. Many people seem to think that the loctite is for the axle ubolts. But the directions clearly state it's for screwing the sumospring down. Axle ubolts don't need loctite. I rechecked mine at 500 miles and 1000 miles. All good.I needed to shift one sumospring slightly back on the spring to get it to line up perfectly with the bumpstop bracket on the passenger side. Easy adjustment.Now have about 1000 miles on them. Initially I thought they rode a bit hard. But they seem to wear in. Maybe slightly harder than factory springs on the trd off-road. But I like it. They raise the back of the truck just about 5/8 inch as other states, which is just perfect as the gen3 tacoma has a higher hood so even unloaded it looked low in the back. With a load they are great. No where near as much squat. Best part is when towing my 3000# travel trailer. Trailer has a 330# tongue load. Generator and other gear in the back is about another additional 200#. Before the back end squatted. It was fine before, no bottoming or anything. But headlights were high and it looks stupid with rear end squatted. Now it's perfectly level. Ride is a little stiffer when loaded, but it's good. It is a truck. I hate that toyota has gone out of way to soften ride too much, compromising loading ability.So far I really like them. Of all the options these were far by far the easiest. Helper springs seem to have challenges hitting the gas tank or frame. Airbags I've had before. They always seem to leak in the New England salt. This seems to be a great compromise for the person that rides empty much of time but then heads off to Home Depot for a large load or takes off like I do with a travel trailer and another couple hundred lbs in back. I really researched these. On website after website I could not find a single review that said they damaged the truck in any way. Some people did not like the ride. But most people seem to really like them.We shall see how they hold up long term. I kept the factory bumpstops just in case. I did think these were just a little bit overpriced for essentially two pieces of engineered foam and a couple brackets. I'd say $150 would be more reasonable. But they seem great in spite of maybe being overpriced.Remember to do one side at a time. Loosening both sides at once would be dangerous and could throw off your alignment. And if you are using a lift like I did use a pole jack under the axle to support the axle.

This is a fantastic rack.  Don't bother with any of the smaller sized racks, you are going to want the cargo room once you start using your rack.  I fit the highland 13 Ft^3 bag and a large 24" wide cooler on the back.  Note: 24" wide coolers fit perfect front to back on this rack.  The light openings are standard trailer/truck oval lights.  I installed and wired up a pair I bought locally myself.  I use this on the back of my 2011 Chevy Equinox I4, which is a smaller SUV, and the rack is not too big for it (I was worried).  Fits perfect with clearance for both the hatch and the exhaust.

RUN-D is a great company and sticks to their word.  I purchased a set of the amber color lights and there was a small issue with the bracket - I had to use a Dremel tool to cut some of the metal so that I could fit the bolts through that go into the side of the light.  I told RUN-D about this and they gave me a brand new pair for free for my trouble. Lights work great also - super bright, probably double the lumens of the other pods out there at 2,800 lumens.

I used this voltmeter to replace the dummy alternator light on my 64 Falcon.  Worked great !  I purchased the blue color.  I installed it behind the factory red lens in the dash.  It gave me a slight purple Hugh, which matches good with the blue LED lights of gauges.  The voltmeter gives off a bright light. Easy to read.  But too bright for a dash, if not behind a colored lens.P.S.  The 2 in the title does not mean two voltmeter s.

First, like other reviewers, the instructions don't at all match the stand.  You may think, OK, but it is just a stand, however the stand I received was possibly designed by a 6 year old...not at all like the functional design shown in the assembly instructions.There are three major flaws1) Front assembly connection to back won't tighten fully - leaving the stand wobbly when assembled.  The engine weight does 'solve' that and it is solid with load, but still.1) The biggest issue was one of the wheel sets.  See photos.  The wheel is oriented on the frame where there are 4 holes to bolt.  However instead of long bolts that go all the way through the frame, they are short bolts that must be put in from INSIDE the tubing.  Now if you have say very very LONG fingers, you might be able to do this, but most humans can't reach inside the small tube that small....see the picture with my hand for reference.So my kludge was to tape the bolt to a box wrench, insert into tube and try to push up through the inboard hole.  It worked...but really should have to do this!  You probably could get away with just bolting the two bolts closest to the end...but for some of us that just 'not right'.2) Front assembly connection to back section won't tighten fully - leaving the stand wobbly when assembled, but not loaded.  The engine weight does 'solve' that and it is solid with load, but still.  And no, we didn't do it wrong, even though instructions didn't match the stand there is no other way to fit the back and front portions together.3) The way the rotating assembly/engine mount brace mounted to the rest of the rig was completely different than described and equally 'worse' design than what instructions said.  Not that it didn't work...just not easy/right/good design.

I purchase this trailer kit as a base for my teardrop trailer project. I had it shipped to my work place for ease of handling as it is a bit heavy, though it shipped in three separate cartons.I opened each of the cartons expecting to find some sort of shipping damage, if only chips, scratches, and scuffs. I went over each of the frame pieces and found nothing. The accessories box (wheels, hubs, fenders, light kit, and hardware) was in good condition as was it's contents. No damage of any kind, whatsoever.Assembly was straightforward with zero surprises. All the parts were there.A couple of notes:1.) Before mounting the wheel hubs, take a few minutes and remove the bearings and seals. You won't find much grease in the bearings, so pack them before installing. There is a grease fitting on each hub, and you can pack the hub full of grease with a grease gun. This is good insurance against moisture entering your hubs and bearings, and rather than removing and repacking bearings each time, you can force fresh grease into the bearings through the hubs.2.) Use a torque wrench when installing your lug nuts. I recently read a complaint from a teardropper using this product whose wheel studs failed and caused considerable damage to his trailer. As a forty year mechanic my best guess is that he over torqued the lug nuts and caused the studs to fail. I ran my lug nuts to 80 ft/lbs and have had no issues.3.) The light kit includes wiring that might be 18 ga, and is extremely flimsy. I found a 14 ga. wiring kit at Harbor Freight for $9. Again, cheap insurance.I purchased a 5x8 because I wanted the width for a queen size mattress in my teardrop. I looked at the 4x8 folding trailers, but the modifications that I had to make were much more difficult because of the folding frame. I flipped the axle, added 14" tires and alloy wheels, and moved the axle back 6", easily done by drilling two new holes in the frame. So I basically voided whatever warranty I had, but it'll be worth it, I think.Thanks for reading.

Owner of 2012 Dodge Challenger SXT, could never figure out why Dodge will sell this vehicles without a functional hood scoops. Haven't taken temp readings with new functional hoop scoops but I'm sure it's working cooler than before, I see no performance gains but like the idea my vehicle is getting more air is never a bad thing. Installation took 10 minutes make sure you have nylon pry tools and some masking tape and your good to go. There is a video on you tube on how to remove the scoops. Overall I think anyone who owns a challenger without the functional hood scoops should get them.

Very good purchase so far for my Audi Q5 SUV.  My vehicle illuminates the DRL, parking lights and fog lights when unlocking the vehicle at night.  Audi's are known for their lighting design.  I have always been bothered by the halogen foglights that came standard on my Audi Q5.  All other lights on my Audi are OEM LED and OEM Bi-Xenon except for the foglights.  I wanted to change that to match all around, but every photo and review of these Philips LED fog lights only shows the color difference or side by side comparison to a halogen bulb.  Of course, there is going to be a color difference, but nobody seems to care or mention the actual usability of the fog lights.  1st, I'm happy to say in my Audi Q5, these do not throw any bulb out codes or any other errors and are very easy to install.  2nd, The light output (Lumens) is about the same as a high quality halogen bulb (+/- 20 lumens estimated), but the light output would make it appear to be more because the color temperature is cooler and is a crisp white which allows you to see more on the road.  The quality of the light coming out of the fog light housing is about the same also, but again the cool crisp light would make one think it is much brighter.  I don't own an actual lumen meter and can't find any info online about exactly how many lumens it actually produces when tested.  In the end, it is plenty of light for a fog light application.  3rd and the most important to me is the beam pattern, which is about 95-98% accurate.  That is extremely good for an aftermarket replacement.  Philips claims it won't blind oncoming traffic.  This appears to be accurate if your fog lights are properly aimed to begin with.  A bad aim is going to cause glare regardless of which bulb is in.  I recommend these bulbs if you want to color match your OEM HID or LED headlight's color temperature better and want actual usable light.**Update**11/04/2017Fog Lights still working great.  Have not noticed any light degradation.  I use these daily.

Perfect fit. Moved form stock wheels on 2012 VW passat (57.1 mm bore) to Audi RS5 wheels (66.5mm bore), these rings eliminated all vibration on the wheels.  I opted to use these rings instead of the spacers as they would make the wheels stick out a bit.  With these rings the wheels look stock and fit well in the wheel well.  No issues what so ever.  Recommend to all who are switching to larger bore Audi wheels from late model VW.

I put these on my buddies 08' GSR 600 and they fit great! They sit nice and flush and they felt solid. However, in the picture you can see the printing on them isn't consistent. One looks great and super sharp white the other is a little blurry/soft and not as neat of a print on the label.

Haven't used it yet, but there's a slight bend in the straight part of the rod between the socket and the first 90 degree bend.  Also, the main handle doesn't rotate, which is a bit strange, since the crank handle does rotate.  We'll see if I change the review after using it.

This came out looking way better then what I was expecting, watched a couple different videos on YouTube on how to do similar products and at a couple different methods of stitching and chose the one I liked best, I spent at tops 30 minutes studying before I tried it and it required about an hour of patience and concentration and the only tool I needed was a knife to cut the string, although a flashlight or headlamp is recommended. A tip I noticed is to make sure every stitch is as tight as possible as you go and as tight as you can around the "spokes" of you steering wheel because it comes out looking smoother and holds in place better. For under $10, it's an excellent buy.*just wanted to add that after showing my fianc my new steering wheel cover, she's insisting that I buy her one and put it in as well so it looks like I'll be buying another one!

False advertising. This is just your regular halogen bulb. Is not brighter nor has a greater output than your stock bulb. Not sure about life of the bulb but from other reviews average is about 2 months.Also the bulbs have no blue tint or have a white color.  The bulb is clear and light is yellow. Nothing wrong with a stock bulb but the advertising is misleading the seller or Amazon should fix that.

Bought 20 used 12, all worked fine. (1 week so far)  Depends on use, you may have to file down the edges or wallow out the hole they might be going into as it is a tad larger than the bulb you are replacing.  Not a major issue, and not for all uses I needed to do this.Using them in a marker light that has no reflector, and is colored red or amber, hard to notice any brightness change over factory bulb. My thoughts, not worth the effort for that.1st pic the lights are in the map light position.  The Dome is another brand festoon 12V 36mm 6411 style bulb and is a white/blue in my 07 Focus.2nd pic  1 LED  1 factory bulb.3rd pic is my 06 Mustang map light,  LED on left, obviously.4th pic  Note, they stay on ultra dim when vehicle is off.  Would take a very long time as in days or weeks to drain the battery, not to worry.  Not the bulbs fault.5th pic is the Mustangs license plate.  Only uses 1 bulb.  sorry not the best picture. And poor blank out of plate number.Hope this was helpful.

Good wrap. Like all header wraps, they're a pain to install. The stainless ties never really feel like they're tight enough. Make sure you wear long sleeves and rubber gloves when wrapping.

Great product. Very bright. I have a 09 silverado with 6 inch lift on 35s and its still bright. Easy installation. The hardest part is running the wires taping them and zip tieing them up. I did have to mount the relay module under the hood. The wires would reach to cab. But it comes with a key fob remote so it works better actually. No drilling holes. Took me 2 hours to install.

So far so good. It is easy to apply with the sponge applicators. I have found when doing a faded surface it is best to blot the surface and gently blow the surface to remove any bubbles. On some surfaces multiple treatments are sometimes required.The product is matte black, no shine after it dries. My only complaint is there is no way to lock the pump handle to prevent accidental spills and due to the amount of product dispensed when it's pushed. It will be interesting to see how long this product will last.

Based on all the rave reviews, I had high hopes for this wheel.  Let me start by saying if you close your eyes and just go with the feel of the rim, it's great. However, the quality of this wheel is nowhere near what I had expected.  There are very noticeable seems in the alcantara at each of the 3 spokes....right where your thumbs rest and bottom center.  This alone makes it look slapped together. The buttons feel like mush and are nowhere near as nice as the stock wheel buttons on my T500.  You also lose buttons if coming from a standard T500 wheel.  Not a surprise but a bummer none the less.  Overall the wheel feels nice in hand but quality as a whole is sub par and not up to the quality of the stock wheel.  It's not so bad that I'd return it, but temper expectations...

I live in Southern California where it is sunny everyday this summer has been around 90's with some heat waves of 105+ days.  I purchased this June 26th, 2012 and now it has completely fell apart.  This product is very cheaply made and is evident as soon as you open it.Cons:-Its so thin and cheap that when it actually gets heated up by the sun it turns into thin paper and just bends easily which can cause it to fall out of your window-After two months the black felt around the edge of the sun shade has started to flake off causing a horrible mess in my car every time you remove the shade more comes off.-Also the eyes and other color now flakes off so there are a bunch of holes in the shade on the painted sidePros:-It was cool for the first month I had it until it started to fall apart.

Unreal results - I've been using optimum products for over a year now, I used chemical guys concentrate wash and wax but found it too expensive and less of a concentrate than optimum. This bottle has lasted me over a year. I use a caps worth with my 32 oz spray bottle and some microfiber towels. I live in extreme heat which restricts water usage, this allows me to keep my vehicle perfect without wasting water. For those that haven't used a waterless wash product, it is important that you only use microfiber towels. Any other towel can damage the paint.

These tiny lights are brighter than i thought they would be. They are perfect for my zero turn mower. They don't come with a very long lead wire or a switch, but it's still a good value.

You will need to use an automotive exterior trim tape which I purchased at autozone for $10.  Added extra adhesion and they applied easy and stayed put and look great.

Great lights, very bright. these are spot so better to mount a little higher an aim down, however i have mine mounted low and they are still effective and bright. great to be used as a DRL also.  RUN-D has great customer services as well, I did have an issue but they were able to give me a free set of lights for the trouble.  thanks!

I own a small detail company and was looking for a better solution that not only works faster but works better than most other stuff I've used. I was recommended this product from several fellow detailers and I can tell you I am honestly in love. Spray on cold wheels, wait a minute, and go to town. I do the inner barrels with a 18" speedmaster wheel brush and the faces with a microfiber cloth. I then rinse. Looks pretty awesome that you can see it emulsifying the iron on the wheel surfaces as it works and turns purple from flourescent yellow. People say the smell is bad and while I would agree it doesn't smell "pretty" , it's not horrible. The smell has grown on me due to the fact I know it's actually doing work. Here's a sample on my daily driver wheels that need cleaning at least twice a week due to heavy dusting with freeway driving and carbon pads.

So, spend over $1,000 or 30 minutes installing this... I installed this on the right rear (passenger side) of the engine on an '03 Silverado 2500HD. Yes the dipstick tube is right in the way of one of the bolts but you can push it enough to give you room to tighten the bolt. Actually I discovered my dipstick tube is rusted away a little below where it comes up through the exhaust manifold (Project for another day). I actually have TWO broken manifold bolts on this side of the engine and this still sealed the leak. I'm very impressed with this part and have to say I have already used three of these (two on my '03 Silverado 6.0 and one on my '03 Tahoe 5.3), and I'm sure I'll be using more!

I bought mine at a local audio shop. Audio to go In Elizabethtown, Kentucky. They charged a flat rate of $300 plus tax for the unit including installation. (Maybe high based off other reviews but they did a good job) I can install a car stereo but this is way beyond my skill ability so I let the shop do it.My car is a 1992 Cadillac Superior Hearse, yes a hearse. It didn't have a remote when I bought it, just power door locks, so I left it unlocked a lot. At least I live in a good area. It's great to have the power door locks actually be useful, and now I actually lock it. The range on the remote seems great. I was inside a store with the car at the end of the parking lot and was able to start it. More range than I need. Great. The horn honks once when locked, twice when unlocked, or you can silence it with the Aux button. Handy. It's great to have remote start to keep it warm, but it's even better to scare people when the hearse randomly starts beside them with no one in it, (or a skeleton) and they think it's haunted. Great gag.I've had no problems with this system and I'm super happy with it.Also, you must put the key in before shifting or it will die. Great feature to prevent theft.

Bought this for my CJ7. I transplanted a 4.0HO into it and didn't care for the mechanical/electric fan setup. I put a Flexalite 160 on my other CJ7 with a V8 and really liked it. This fan was a success also. It fit nearly perfect behind the stock radiator and the control module works nicely. I had to modify the brackets they sent, but they sent 2 different styles, so you have plenty to choose. All hardware, heavy duty 10gauge wiring was included. I didn't need anything else. It keeps my engine at 190 degrees F and I can adjust it for summer and winter temperatures, or wheeling. I also must mention the HP I got back by getting rid of the the mechanical fan completely; the engine revs up better.

I'm very happy with my Warn plow and push tube setup. They are both quality products and work well together. I use the plow and push tube to do my driveway and sometimes the neighbors driveway. With the ability to turn plow left or right (with the manual adjustment lever), this set up works very well. 2-3 passes on the drive way and I'm done. I use this on my Kawasaki BF  750 so there's plenty of power to push the snow. I've used it with 6-8" of snow with no problems.

First, these are nicely machined and well put together pieces. Look very high quality. But...Clutch side is just wrong. Won't work on any human-sized bike. Lever mount is grossly mis-sized, holds the lever 6" away from the bar. 4" away at the lowest setting which is still too far for normal human finger, let alone needing to wrap around the lever to grip it. What were they thinking? Look at pics, you'll see what I mean.Also, I could have, might have, kept the kit and just used the master cyl as that fit fine, but the mirror mount was right below the throttle cables on my bike (adventure bike) with the dual cable setup that is above the bar (like a dirtbike throttle). So I would have to find another place to mount a mirror. In the end it was too much headache, so I returned them.

I've cut two of these open for inspection.  Each time, everything was intact and well-made.  The filter media is glued to the end-caps with a generous amount of adhesive.  The longest I've run one is 7.5k miles.  I have enough confidence to now run two oil changes on one filter, and go past 10k miles.  Maybe you can buy as good a filter for less money, but I like paying for peace of mind.

first let me start by saying; " Dont listen to others when it comes to prepping the llight cover thats going to be painted";  It sticks fine without the extra sanding and all that not need acetone mess. The instructions on the can does not state that you would have to do such, and theres probably a reason why.  All u have to do as it states, is to clean the light with a wax  removal detergent. Heck alcohol will clean the surface good enough. wipe with a dry clean cloth after you wipe/clean the light up good and  C'est Magnifique, your light is ready to be tinted. I put the lights in a box and sprayed them while in the box.  I did mess up by doing it outside while the wind was up a little bit so yes it gave me the shrink effect./ if u get up close u will see some lil lines that look like stress cracks in it. So if u can, do it in doors. Overall the product works as stated. I am glad that I didn't buy the aftermarket lights I wanted. This saved me a ton of money. I was afraid of doing more than 2 coats, i was playing it safe i think i couldve went one more coat but im satisfied, with the end results  Who wants there tail lights tinted???  LOL .  Oh and for that beautiful extra shine add clear coat, make sure its non yellowing, for outdoor use, and say gloss.

Purchased these cables when replacing the plugs on my 2008 Subaru Outback.  Quality construction and perfect OEM fit.  My only issues is that they're blue which is great if you're going for engine bay bling.  Would have preferred black as not to draw attention to aftermarket parts in my engine bay which the dealer seems to seek out.

Definitely better than the stock non-towing mirrors but the passenger side does need to be convex rather than flat. It doesn't need a lot because that would make things too small, but as it is you can't quite see the full length of a 24" (plus tongue) enclosed trailer.Having said that, it's worth it just for the driver's side. Instead of staring at the corner of your trailer you can see down along the whole thing and look at the tires as well as the lane next to you.The problem with the passenger side is you can see the lane next to you but not the back corner or tires.

I attached the sensor to the test port on my transmission on my nissan frontier using the auto meter 2265 metric adapter - I bored out the middle of the adapter so the sensor would fit.  Works great with the inline sensor before trans cooler, all readings are spot on.

Great tool, works as it should, no problems.  I'd recommend this product for all inner coil spring compressions.  I've the hook type and they are really dangerous, this one is definitely the way to go.  I compressed my front coil springs (for a 66 Comet) to 12 inches with no issues.  Don't get me wrong, I still was very cautious and handled the compressed springs very carefully, like one of the other users said, "like old dynamite."  I've attached a couple pics, hope they come out clear.

Update its not even 2 years since install and one rubber boot looks so dry rotted like its been sitting for years. the car is driven daily and often.----Made with different metal than OEM making them 1/3 the size in thickness and more importantly have a wrenchable NUT edge on the back end of the bolt so you can actually get them off if they fail unlike the OEMs which you have to sawzall off since the allen wrench hole in the end of the bolt is in no way strong enough and just strips.Hopefully they last 150k+ miles like the originals.

Well as I bought this for a friend as a birthday gift I originally bought the full face helmet not realizing he was claustrophobic so I opted for the full open face which I like the way the closure is a quick release versus a double d-ring to secure the strap I will have to finish this review after he receives the gift and put his input on it but as far as I am concerned it is a very sturdy helmet one of the better ones out there if I was in need of one personally this would be the helmet

First of allMADE IN THE USA!!!  If you have a motorcycle and need to ever put it on a trailer, you need these straps.  I have been in situations where my bike fell over from hitting bumps in the road and have bought similar products to this.  The others are very thin, have less tensile strength and have rough edges.  These straps are very think and have almost 3000 lb breach strength.  I am no engineer, but I don't think I can put 3000 lbs of torque on these straps with my ratchets.These are essential to protect your bike or other equipment as well.  I am not sure what one of the reviewers what expecting?  Include hooks?  They must have not known what they were getting?  These simply loop over and though the frame or handlebars, attach a ratchet or other type of tie-down device and tighten.  These soft loops help keep the metal from the tie-down strap or device away from paint or any other part of the bike that may be marred by metal parts.It is essential to use these straps to protect your investment and these are perfect for just that.  They are soft with no rough edges, which can mar paint and chrome.The attached pictures show how the 18" Soft Loop Tie Down Straps, 4 Pack work.  The black strap with yellow stitching is the Soft Loop Tie Down Straps and the orange strap is one of my ratcheting tie down.  Notice how far the metal hook on the ratchet strap is away from any important bike parts because the Soft Loop Tie Down Straps is in place.+++DISCLAIMER+++:  I was offered this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased/objective/honest review and that is exactly that I did.  MAN WAS I LUCKY!!!

Great unit. Installed it into my 2008 harley vrscdx. I hard wired it in so I can't attest to the plug if it fits or not on this bike, but it's a great light. If anyone is going to hard wire it in, the red wire on the light was the ground for me. I was checking light operation using the black wire as ground but couldn't get it to work properly. After some trial and error I got it going.

Exactly as described and fit in perfectly on my 2007 Pontiac Vibe. Chainring the radiator itself was a breeze but working the hoses off the old on and putting them back on wasn't the most fun. Definitely double check your hoses before cranking your vehicle up, forgot to hookup a tranny line and lost some tranny fluid but no big deal, $50 well spent!

This was not a very fun job, and the U-Bolts didn't really fit over the tie rods causing some of the threads to flatten out because the fitment was so tight. The instructions that came with the stabilizer wasn't very good. It took all of about an hour and a half. I can't speak for the functionality of it yet because I haven't even gone on a test drive, but I did verify the wheels turn all the way left and all the way right. The instructions that came with the stabilizer said to check tightness of the bolts periodically, but I just loaded them up with blue loctite and will only check when I grease my other front end components. I will update back when I have a few miles on it. Below is the plastic box that I was talking about. I would recommend anyone remove this first before installing a stabilizer.EDIT: Just got back from a drive. The dampening is good, it is just enough and its there when you need it. I was running over everything, the reflectors between lanes, potholes, and even the little whoops they have beside highways without a wall on the outside of em. I bought these for one reason, to cure the "walk" of mud tires at low speeds. If anyone has ever had mud tires, you know how they tend to move side to side, or vibrate, but I call it "walk". This has seem to cure that, which I'm extremely happy about. No more vibration at low speeds. Overall, I'm happy and would buy this kit over and over again.

Highlights are:*15 foot cord plugs into lighter and reaches all my truck windows*heats up quickly*LED light that can be turned on and off*The shape and texture of the handle makes it easy to hold onto I will update this review in the next week or two when the Minnesota winter had officially begun. Until then, the way I have tested it makes me hopeful that this well make the windshield scrapping a lot less work!I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

This stuff is great! It's like running engine degreaser through your engine so don't run it for longer than 5 minutes like the instructions say. Follow the directions! Upon draining the oil, it was really thinned out. I'm sure this stuff dissolved deposits and sludge in the engine. I use it in older cars I acquire of questionable maintainance histories.

So, this "Tyger" brand, no offense at all..but I was pretty dubious about. Also I felt bad that my first big purchase was from a Chinese brand. But I really liked the design on them. Anyway, I was worried they'd be really crap quality.When they arrived, boy are these guys heavy! I mean I don't have any experience dealing with side rails, so honestly I can't give a balanced comparison, but these feel very very solid, plus the texture on them is super "rough". I'm happy with that, I didn't want smooth, polished rails, these are very gritty and rough to the touch.What I liked is that the instructions were (sort of) clear and concise. Again I mean NO offense by this at all....but a lot of "Foriegn" instructions for these types of things provide really poorly worded, mis-spelled and horribly laid out instructions. The instructions provided here were pretty good. Images helped. I just wish they would have provided images of the different screws/washers/nuts with each one next to the name.My overall rating of these rails? I like 'em. A bit of a learning curve if you're doing it with one person. Oh yea and one of the 6mm bolts I couldn't put on in the passenger side. The rail doesn't sit exactly flush so the screw isn't aligned...This could be because I did it with no one lining it up for me, so I won't count it as a big strike against them. Also they don't sit that low, so it's only like an inch or two difference between the these rails and the lip of the cabin. Also I wish they stuck out a bit more it actually seems like more effort (for me, I'm younger) to use the rail rather than to just hop into the cabin.

I actually didn't know how this would look since it was on a car, I am used to SUV's but finally got tired of 18-20mpg. I just got a 2016 Elantra and noticed that the hood is getting riddled with everything since it slopes down so much. It installed easily and looks great.... Kinda low profile, but still just enough to push some stuff away from the hood.Edit, I used the existing Hyundai push clips instead of the what came with the carflector. From what others are saying, it sounds like the 2016 has newer clips, they are T shaped on the top and rounded screw like on the bottom, and work perfectly and fit tightly. They pull out easily with needle nose pliers and push back in securely with a good grip, producing NO movement at all.

I used them on an old economy power king tractor and they work great. Light comes out in about a 45 degree cone and has good light for about 40' away. There are two power wires. The red is high power, black is low power. I guess because these are basically the red tail lights but in white. I used the Red wire and white ground wire.

I initially liked this wiper but after an experience that happened yesterday, I could not recommend this. the rubber part of the wiper slides along a track inside the wiper and it is supposed to be stopped by two end-caps. the problem is the far part of the end-cap does not stop the rubber piece and it slowly slips out and begins to flap, hitting the roof. I was driving in a tropical storm when this happened again, forcing me to actually pull over and grab the flapping rubber through my window to put back on later.As the rubber slides out of the wiper, it also cleans less and less of the window causing a dangerous loss of clear windshield area. These wipers are dangerous and they need a re-design that securely locks the rubber insert to the frame, otherwise they should not be allowed on the road.

Wow what a great unit for the price! Much cheaper than OEM part but the quality looks much better. It has all-aluminum body instead plastic. It is also vented unit. Solved misfire issues on our S10 Blazer 1999. My old distributor had sligltly worn gear (common issue on 4.3 V6s) but also somewhat modified hold-down clamp so the ignition advance had to be off too. Now the truck runs great again.

The Good:- Soft flexible silicone makes installation and removal easy- High color makes it easy to spot under the hoodThe Bad:- The color is more of a true red and not as bright as the pictureSummary:I purchased this to replace some vacuum lines on my 1995 Ranger STX. I was very pleased with the product and I am looking forward to many years of use. I will try to give an update after a few years to see how it holds up. The photo I included should show the difference between this color hose and the smaller "Autobahn 88" brand hose I purchased. The smaller hose definitely has more of a bright/neon color to it which is what I was expecting of this hose. Here is a link to that product which I used as well:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Universal-Branded-Silicone-Vacuum-Hose-ID-0-16-34-4mm-OD-0-3-34-7-5mm-15-Feet-4-5-Meter-Reel-Red/dp/B01GECBH2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Universal (Branded) Silicone Vacuum Hose, ID 0.16" (4mm) OD 0.3" (7.5mm), 15 Feet (4.5 Meter) Reel, Red</a>

My AMAZON RATINGSProduct as described. But, Just received this 4" recovery strap, hooked it to my truck, the black end protectors shredded in the first 10 minutes of using the strap. The strap seems to be a OK strap. Seems thinner than the one I have been using. It did its job, but disappointed about the black end protectors shredding.Pros:+ product as described+ photo as ShownCons:-  the black end protectors shredded in the first 10-- How I rate 5 Stars:Works exactly as advertised, is a good value at the price point purchased, would buy again or recommend to a friend.4 Stars:Works exactly as advertised, fit/finish are what you'd expect when purchasing this type of product, might have a minor flaw.3 Stars:Generally works but it may not be a good value at the price point or might like to see changes / improvements.2 Stars:Barely works but can be made useful if you try.1 Star:Useless, does not perform its intended function whatsoever and is generally a waste of money, sending it back.Overall: I am giving this my star rating based on my criteria above. (Product photo as received)if this review was helpful let me know. Thanks :-)

Installed on a Infiniti qx56,  the factory air ride went out AGIAN!. This was a simple fix,  returned the vehicle to the proper ride height. Honestly I think it rides even better than it did with the factory air ride. Super easy to install, I bought the T air fitting for easy of inflating both sides at the same time.

I didn't get even-texture or the coverage I expected (I'm a semi-pro refinisher), but the nozzle does shoot a decent, controllable pattern.  Will be interesting to see how this holds up to boat-use (engine and manifolds usually don't exceed 175-180F, which is lower than a car-engine) and salt-water spray.  I'll update this review next year!

So I wanted something a little brighter than OEM but not blind other drivers like some of the new LED's. These are advertised as being 60% brighter but still be within legal limits. The attached picture shows they are brighter/whiter in color than the original (new bulb on left). If I had to guess they are roughly 40% brighter although the picture does not do it justice. Since each auto has different optics the end result can be different, so for the record these were installed in a 2011 Volvo XC60. Overall I am satisfied with the results and will follow-up if they need replaced. Note: If you have the same model vehicle and are considering LED, the bulb is behind a cover on the back of the head light assembly with minimal clearance. So trying to fit a longer bulb would not work without modifying the cover and risking a bad seal.

Quality components, very well made.  It took me about 40 minutes to install, I'm a pretty skilled mechanic.  If you work on your own vehicles, this is a breeze to install - it's maybe a 2 out of 10 on the difficulty scale..  The directions are not perfect, but again, if you work on cars you'll have no problem.  The included T20 bit was useless for me to remove my MAP sensor since it was a male stud TORX head.  I used a 6 point, 5/32 socket to take it off.There is a DEFINITE increase in the whistle of the turbos, but especially the noise of the air being sucked in like some giant, sinister vacuum cleaner.  It is a beautiful sound in my opinion.  It's hypnotic.  The sound alone makes it obvious that the truck is breathing much better,  Breathing better makes horsepower, end of discussion.It's too soon to determine if there is any improvement in MPG.  I do think the turbos seem to spool up more quickly.  I'll add to the review once I have put some miles in.One irritation - the scratches on the rear tube.  It arrived that way.  I expect perfection for FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS.  See pics.Update: After 1.5 years of commuting to work - 95% interstate driving - I can say for me there was no difference in fuel economy either way.  I love the sound and maybe that's why there was no change, maybe I'm a little more lead-footed with it installed.

UPDATE:  I have been riding with this vest for about a year and over 6,000 miles with it on me or strapped to the bike.  Leather and stitching as good as new if not better as it is getting softer with use.  More patches please.  2,500 mile run with an Iron Butt 1K/24 in 2 months.  Where to put that patch...  If you are getting a bike and want that Wild Hogs experience, you need this vest.Made in Milwaukee, Pakistan.  I have ordered other leather goods from Pakistan and find them to be an excellent value with decent to very good leather and quality stitching.  This one uses very nice leather.Excellent fit that is exactly as you would expect.  I normally wear an XL shirt.  I am 6-4" and 240 pounds.  I ordered a 2XL after some reviews claiming "Midget" sizing.  I did not find this to be the case at all and wish I had ordered an XL.  The lacing on the side pulled it in to a decent fit and I can wear a hoody under it, so I will keep it.  It is a little loose around the belly, but that will leave more beer room!I do not carry a gun, the "carry" pockets are on the inside and have an elastic loop to hold the barrel.  But, these are just pockets and hold a wallet fine.  The outside pockets on front do not have closures of any kind, don't put stuff there that might bounce out on the motorcycle.This vest works well under a mesh riding jacket in the morning to keep me warm then folds up nicely to pack away later in the day when it warms up.  I will be using this to gather patches on the ride I am leaving on soon.I will be putting a few thousand miles on this vest over the next two weeks.  I will update this review good or bad.  Stay tuned.Pro's: - Soft but heavy leather feels good on the hand and hangs nicely, not sloppy or loose - Smells great like any good leather product, not "urine" as another buyer noted, maybe his cat got to it? - Nicely lined with a cotton or polyester canvas type ticking with a nice red and black look - Snaps are heavy - Lacing on the sides allows a great deal of variation in sizing - Nice big leather pieces with seams where they should be, not a patchwork vest - Stitching is tight, even and straight, no loose threadsCon's: - A zipper while not expected would be betterUPDATE - I am 1200 miles into the trip. I had a number of patches sewn onto the vest. It adds a good deal of warmth and blocks the wind far better than I expected. It is getting soft with use. Nice vest.

Well after read other about this shift boot I decided to purchase it for my 2007 Honda Civic Si. some work was involved in getting this thing to fit. A bit more than I expected. I am uploading photos to give you an idea of what I did. The first photo shows all the tools that I needed. I then took photos of steepling it to the plastic shroud underneath it. Because of the thickness I had to cut a little more off and by doing so I had to add a couple staples on the side. As you can see from the photo one steeple was visible. I used a black marker to blend it in. the thing that I didn't like about this new boot was its thickness. One photo shows that I was having a difficult time screwing in the last bolt to secure it. that's what made it difficult to reassemble. I would say it's a solid 3 1/2 stars not quite 4. hopefully these photos will help you with a similar vehicle.

Great tool, came packaged very nicely. I will update after a few uses,I was honestly expecting it to look and feel cheap. It doesn't, it actually feels and looks great and came in a timely manner. Will be using this to remove and install the boots on my wife's 1998 ML320 these boots are a PITA. Easy to remove but because of their location this tool will help me to endure they are all seated properly.

Such a nice windshield for 18 bucks. It's glossy and pretty. Ok so the only bad thing about this is that it does NOT come with new screws now I don't really care about it so I didn't deduct stars but I know some of you might care.The delivery was fast and I had no problems fitting it on my 2004 Honda CBR600 RR. On my 4th pic you can check out how the black one looks, you can actually see through it. Over all for 18 bucks you just can't beat it. I say get it. Super easy to install and the packaging was good it was well protected.

It is a piece of garbage. used it on my engine stand under the engine while I disassembled it. it isn't wide enough to catch everything. also after oil and other, engine related chemicals sat in it for several hours the plastic became pliable and began to stretch and seep fluids through it.

Originally, I purchased this for a vehicle engine air intake -- cooler air = more mpg/power.  However, I found that it works well for high temperature halogen lighting fixtures.  In the winter, CFL take too long warm up in a garage door opener.  So, I employ 150 watt halogen lamps.  Even with the translucent fixtures removed, the lamps still melt the dark plastic housing on the garage door opener.  With this heat barrier covering all of the nearby surfaces, not only is the plastic housing protected but better light out is realized.

Terribly disappointed with this system. Useless after three days!!! We are full time RVers and thought we had stumbled upon a sweet new set up. See my pics.The connection at the clamps slid completely out of its sleeve or what looks like a silicone hold. Granted it is 120 degrees in Hurricane, Utah as it was also in Las Vegas when I first used it.You don't always get what you pay for. Hopefully the company will reimburse me. I'll let you know.Update: they sent me a new hose. Same issue. These things do not withstand high heat locations. Great concept. Cheaply put together.

Some people were saying that it fits loose and others say it moves around, but with a photo to prove it...fits fits just right. It covers the entire truck area except the side pockets of course. It comes in a box rolled up but it's ok. It has a ridged feel with the 'Escape' logo on it that adds to that style. It kinda has a bend to it but when it is layed flat and it takes the shape being flat then it will not have the bend. I have a 2017 Escape, but this if meant for anyone with a 2013+ year's. Genuinely a Ford product.

This is all around a really solid catch can. I'm using it on a turbocharged 2.5L Subaru which has a crankcase ventilator and two valve cover breathers. I've deleted the PCV valve on my car as it's a track and show car only, so the crankcase vent is plumbed to one of the inlets, and on the other inlet I've installed a -10AN tee fitting which the two valve cover breathers are plumbed to. You can see my plumbing in the attached photos.The outlet for the can is filtered (the bronze micron filter mentioned in the product description) to compliment the can's internal baffling, which gives me peace of mind and confidence to use the turbo inlet as a vacuum source. I've yet to put the can to the test as the car is off the road for the winter months, but I'm confident that I won't see any oil vapor in the intake tract with this can in place.The can itself is a modular design which allows for easy disassembly for cleaning, and the bottom of the can features a 3/8 NPT port to be used for draining. I replaced the included NPT hex plug on the bottom of the can with a DOT swivel elbow, and plumbed the drain line to a petcock valve mounted securely below the vehicle in an easy to access location.The included fittings are plastic which I opted not to use, but seeing as the ports on the can are 3/8 NPT you have plenty of options for using either brass or aluminum barbs, or even NPT to AN adapters like I have.The included mounting bracket isn't terribly useful on its own, but it did make fabricating a bracket out of stainless steel a bit less labor intensive.Overall this is well built and thoughtfully designed catch can at a price much lower than other universal cans and especially "direct fit" products.

I got this as a replacement for my adapter that I use when my trailer is in my driveway and I plug it a regular extension cord running from my house. I had started to experience some connection issues and it It finally occurred to me that the old adapter was past its prime.the old adapter was also just slippery plastic and terrible to use when wet or even just sweaty. In comparison now, I can see my old one was also too small (in picture) and too slippery, especially when compared to this unit.For the money, this was a no-brainer upgrade. It came brand new with no dust and shiny new male and female parts. Nice and hefty and feels sturdy and rubbery.When I took a flashlight and looked at my old one, there was dirt and leaf debris and just general corrosion and in retrospect quite obvious it needed to be replaced. There's so many things with trailers, this was an easy preventative maintenance item and upgrade.

It works as stated. I have it mounted in my Ford F-150.  I can't say that I have used it much. but it does cool down. I would have given it 5 starts. But the part that gets cold is only the bottem half of the compartment. if the compartment was fully lined, would have been a better product. It will keep cold drinks cold. and will cool down drinks if operated for hours. The picture shows how I have it installed.

Disapointing. Not as bright as stock bulbs. They are very white but not bright enough. Stock bulb is in drivers side. The Philips LED is on passengers side. See pictures. They might be good enough for somewhere else like maybe a reading lamp or map light. But not for shining on the floor.UPDATE:: They work great for my map lights. Nice and white and bright enough for the map lights.. Great fit in map light housing. Chevy blazer 1995 with little round map lights. Photo will come later.Photo's uploaded.

When the manufacturer of this light first offered their product, they offered a light kit that appeared as though it completely replaced the existing fan trim/bezel. The kit included an integrated on/off button. The light looked great and looked like it could have come equipped that way from the RV factory. The product I received is a cheap looking trim ring. It no longer has an on/off button. The trim ring doesn't even match up correctly to the four corners of the OE bezel. The screw holes don't match up either, meaning you'll have to drill four mounting holes in the OE bezel. This is contrary to the installation instructions that state only one hole needs to be drilled for the wiring. I have a ShurFlo and a Fan-Tastic Fan in my RV. The fitment issue was the same for both. It's too bad the manufacturer didn't get this right, as it is a great idea. I returned mine promptly.

First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product.

Claimed it fit my 1995 3/4-ton (2500) Suburban, GVWR 8600#, but it does not.  This does look like it will fit my 1/2-ton 'burb.  Maybe it will fit lighter-duty 3/4 tons...  This one is about 7 1/4" between the mounting bushings, the one I needed is about 9 1/2" between, so go measure before ordering.  Look at my attached picture.  If yours looks like the shiny black one, this is for you.  If yours looks like the one with 200K miles on it, it will not fit.

I added two pictures to show size and jeep and fit of the cover. The cover is well made, durable, and fits well, with a little room to spare, which is better than being tight, and a lot easier to put on. It has grommets on the side to bungee/tie down to help secure it. I also added one to the front because during a wind storm it started to lift up there. It is water proof. It rained for two days straight, and when I went to take the top off there was 3 inches of water collect on top (I didn't have a top on the jeep, so it sagged a little). However, the interior of the jeep was 100% dry. Very happy with the product. Rolled up it's about the size of a rolled up sleeping bag.

Tried these on my 2002 Ford F-250 7.3 4wd. To replace drag link boots. Energy suspension doesn't show one that is an exact fit for my truck. Someone else's review said they worked for a similar truck, so I decided for $4 it's worth a shot. My original boots were not holding the grease in and allowing my link to clunk when I turned the wheel hard. This was a cheap try for the fix. It seems to be doing the job. They are snug. I took measurements of my ball joint to check if there's a better fit. The 9.13105 is the next closest they offer. As cheap as these are id order both next time and see what works better. I took quit a few pics to help. Hope this is good info for someone else. Good luck and goodnight.

Looks great, had creases in it when received but cleared up mostly with time and heat gun. Be careful of the heat though, had one spot cook and not fair so well. Very minute and not too noticeable. Worth it and would definitely order again. I feel had I waited longer the crews would have released. Patients is a virtue I don't possess.

Really a fair quality cover and a great price. I installed it alone and was very careful and it took all of 20 minutes. I dinged it 1 star for the "too basic" instructions and for the included light magnet falling out. Otherwise it's great. Here's my install hints:When doing the clamps, go ahead and lay in the bed, it's much easier.Tighten clamps just enough to hold/seal then allow it to set a couple days, then re-tighten if neededIt couldn't be much easier and there's videos on YT if you need them.

Great for the price but I tried stacking two single blocks on the top of the pyramid which caused the top block to break apart. This is a fairly light Lance camper on a 2500 Dodge truck so I'd be curious what would happen with something heavier like many of the Arctic Fox models. Anyways, these are good enough for the price that I'll be buying another set.

Showed fit for 04 Grand Cherokee Laredo 4.7. It did not. Seller was unaware and very helpful. The joint was 1/4 inch too large and straight. I used the boot on the factory baffle and removed the chrome joint skirt from the kit; fitting them together they fit the throttle body but they interfered with the hood. Seller provided a 45 joint and with small modifications there was no hood interference.

Seller did very well on getting the exhaust here on time, the fit was alright but does have one area towards the rear where exhaust rattles against a lower differential brace, all alittle tight on factory hanger positions but overall fits on well, also noticed a few welds were skimpy on the penetration but for the price you can't beat what is provided, also came with a bunch of cool stuff in the box like t-shirt, hat, stickers, lanyard, and more.

Im giving this 5 Stars. Received all the parts that were listed, and was surprised. Yes there was some Mocking Up of these parts for it to fit my Bike or Any Other Bike.  I have one of the First 1994 Harley Davidson Road Kings Built #1486. Verified by HD. Purchased a quick disconnect and the Tour Pack. Looks Good. So if you're looking for a Good Low Cut Touring Pack! Purchase this one. I have over 180,000 miles on my bike and should the Good Lord let me stay here longer. Ill put another 180,000 on Her. For the price you will not go wrong. So if you're not mechanically incline. You will need someone to install it. But you will be Happy with the finished product. I am, and Ive been riding since the early 70s. Ride Safe and the May The Good Lord Be With You.

I put some 7" hid floods on these on my brush guard and the aluminum itself is very nice and easy to install..the reason for the lower rating is they vibrate due to the rubber mounts so ill probably have to go a different direction with some kind of rigid mount.

I just buffed my boat with 3m marine compound and finishing material and it looked really cloudy and blotchy. I rinsed the hull after the 3m and it showed horrendous water spots and runs all over the boat. I felt totally defeated after 2 days of hard work so I figured why not apply the Rejex anyway. After applying Rejex and waiting 20 minutes, I buffed it off and viola, the hull looks brand new! Who knows how long it'll last so I'll update the post later on. I also applied Rejex to 1 panel of my Yukon about a month ago. I washed the truck today and the Rejex panel is still beading water like crazy while the NXT synthetic wax is mostly disappeared. I'm sold on Rejex for now and can't wait to do the inside of my boat next

This also happens to fit a 2015-2018 Chevrolet Colorado or GMC Canyon  with a bit (5/8") of front corner trimming.Nice and deep and also easy ti put in and out. Also allows some space in the rear for standing up maps.

Best Accessory I've purchased in a long time!  Just got back from a 4000 mile ride from San Diego to Pensacola which included a 1016 mile day, another at 892, and none under 350.  This bag made the miles easy.  Holds tons of stuff, fits perfectly on my 2015 Road Glide with King Tour Pack (no speakers).  I went through all of the reviews and wanted to address most of the negative concerns:No Rain Cover.  Oddly, this was the most prevalent problem noted in the reviews and the most easily solved.  I put my gear in a 42 gallon, heavy duty contractor .3mil trash bag and then placed it all inside the seat bag.  Problem solved for about 35 cents.  If you don't want to put your things in the trash bag, this same size trash bag will fit over the entire seat bag, again solving the rain problem.  The seat bag is NOT water proof and hardly resistant, so plan ahead and enjoy dry gear after a rainy day.Flexes when not completely full.  Really?  Of course it does, so fill it up and it will work fantastically.Too much space between rider and the bag.  This is less an issue with the bag and more to do with individual body geometry.  I solved the issue, or I should say my wife solved the issue, by adding an "ergonomic mesh back support" the kind used on office chairs; genius (see pictures)!  I untied the elastic webbing on the seat bag and replaced them through the office char support.  The result was nothing less than incredible; breathes well, flexible, adjustable, like riding with a comfortable chair back.  Saddlemen need to adopt this option!Doesn't lock.  Few if any of these types of bags do.  Buy a cable lock and route it through the multiple attachment rings.  I went to the hardware store, bought a length of covered steel cable, cut it to length, and made two cables, one side looped through the tour pack bracket on each side, routed through rings, around the back-rest area, over the top, and locked to tour pack rack with combo lock.  (see pictures)Rubs speaker grills.  Valid point.  I don't have speakers on my tour pack, but I could definitely see this being a problem.  Others suggest using coffee can lids; good advice.Handle is weak.  It is a bit cheesy, but then again, I packed a lot of stuff in the bag and carried it many times with that cheesy handle without problem.Bottom line.  This bag worked exceptionally well for me and made the long miles a breeze.  My only problem is in not having found this sooner!

Very nice quality. I installed this on my 2011 silverado 2wd max trailering package 6.2l. I started with 36 1/2" up front rear was 39 3/4. Finished with 37" on all four corners. Very pleased with the look of the level truck. It went on relatively easy except for the top shackle bolts. You need remove the trailer hitch for the bottom bolts and for the top bolts you need to fold over the bed seam or loosen the bed from the truck to raise the shackle high enough to remove the top bolt. The loosening of ubolts for lift block removal was easier than i thought.  spacers were really easy to install and tighten leaf springs back up.  Looking good though.

WOW Bright!White is almost headlight bright, cool white color probably close to 5K or 5500K not blue.VERY BRIGHT! Im going to see how these go over on the road... 2012 Silverado. 4 Installed.Fit great, no clearance issues in the housing.Amber is awesome. A little more yellow than the stock sylvania bulb but acceptable.Takes a second or so to go to white when powered on and when flashing stops. Not an issue. Im not using these for headlights... but I can see around my neighborhood to drive at like 5mph with only these on!Use a resistor to fix the hyperblink. One is needed for every bulb. I used these -  CUTEQUEEN TRADING 4PCS 50W 6Ohm LED Load Resistors - No issues with them, read my review there for install info on a 2012 Silverado.Photos -1 - LED and Sylvania Silverstar ZXE Headlamps2 - White3 - Amber4 - Comparison to stock signals.

STUPID bright...and I mean that literally.I had a plate bulb go out so i bought these. Simple right?Well, it should have been, but these are so bright it was like driving around with a spotlight on my license plate.. which is not ideal.Secondarily, the brightness made a reflection off my back bumper which made a nasty glare in my backup camera display, again, not ideal.I love how bright they are, but could not leave them in the license plate illumination position without drawing far too much attention to myself..I'm saving them for a purpose I have yet to find that can make good use of that many lumensSee pictures for (1) OEM (yellowish) vs Super White 6418 C5W LED (300lm)and (2) Super White 6418 C5W LED (300lm) vs proper LED (80lm) from another sourceI ended up staying with the 80lm LEDs, they look perfect and should last forever.

These are really great gloves. I Wish they would have stayed together longer, even though they are inexpensive. The right glove started breaking at the seams along the normal place the seems tend to break on gloves, along the palm. I am nonplussed by the amount of time it took for the seam to break, however. The gel pads and the gloves themselves are freaking comfy, right out of the bag. This would be a 5star rating if the manufacturer would bolster the stitching so this didn't happen in 6 weeks....

I ordered this hitch cover for my 2016 Ram 1500 Bighorn because Im very detail oriented and I thought that it would make a nice touch considering that other than my utility trailer I don't tow anything much. The item fits right in place like OEM and seems to be of durable quality.

Pretty neat. The double sided tape doesn't hold well so I used zip-ties. I also don't like wires running everywhere so I wired them into my fuse block but that means they turn on automatically when I start my truck. It does remember what color you used last.

Used the new P92001 winch to replace my old P30001 Carefree winch.  For clarity sake the P92001 is the same as the P55012.  The first being OEM verses replacement. The winch used the same bolt pattern as the old one and was fairly easy to install.  For cabling there is just the power cable to go up to the battery and the line going to the switch.  The stop and start adjustment is also much easier than the previous unit.  One small gotcha is the new spindle is larger so if your cable is already on the short side you might not have enough to get the recommended 2-3 winds at the down position.  I only got about 1.5.  Hopefully it will be enough.The new winch uses less power than previous models.  The wires are thinner and it only has a 40A breaker on it verses 50A before.  This one can also lift 1200 lbs.  Since it no longer uses a worm drive lubricating the gears is not required per Carefree support.  The new unit is very loud in operation but it works well and is pretty fine.

This item works great. Its exactly as advertised. It should work for almost any 4pin connector if you install it correctly over the wires and not the tip. See the images I posted to see how it looks and works. I recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to drill holes to mount a bracket.

Bought a set to replace the dome lights in my car and look great at night! These are much brighter and more pure white light compared to my other white 194 size 5-SMD led map lights. Would definitely recommend buying these but remember get the most led's you can fit into the space your replacing the other bulbs. More LED's in each bulb means MORE LIGHT! The size is right at 39mm so size is perfect. I added a couple of pics to show you how they look.

So I purchased this with much hesitation after reading other, lackluster reviews. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. First off, no, this won't turn your truck into a safe, however it will stop some kids from lifting your $300 tonneau cover in a parking lot or whatever. The construction isn't great for a security product, but it's also likely not the weakest link either.  The most important thing is to make sure you choose the right model for your vehicle, my Mazda has a metal handle, so I needed this kit vs the other kit they sell. If you're not sure, check their website. Installation wasn't that big of a deal, but their directions definitely left something to be desired.This is really the only game in town for Rangers/Mazda pickups, and it's not as bad as everyone says.

I've had the soft top on my 96 Miata for about a year and a half. Half of that time the car has been kept in a garage and out of the elements (central North Carolina). Today I noticed one of the seams was starting to come apart, first on the outside and now on the inside (rain now drips in)(see photos). I'm very disappointed that despite painstakingly installing and caring for it, it has still started to fail. If you want something that will last more than 2 years, I would recommend you spend the money on a top actually made to last. If you just need something for a year or two, then you can take the gamble on this one.Cons: cheap, thin, poor longetivity, back plastic window creases/scratches easily, LOUD (no noise insulation as compared to factory quality tops)Pros: cheap*Update* - the top has continued to come apart in that area. Do yourself a favor and avoid this top. Every bad review for this product is because the adhesive coming apart at some of the tighter scenes. It's very likely it will happen to you too.  I've reached out about a warranty claim, but have yet to hear anything definitive. Then again, I'm not sure I even want to spend the time/money on having a replacement top installed if it's only going to last another year or two.

I own a set of Hopkins BC0840PDQ "Juice" medium duty jumper cables.  I've never really liked the "Cinch-Lock" clamps that came with my jumper cables but I tolerated them.  After a few years, the original clamps' insulating paint was flaking off.  I could not rely on my jumper cables.I wanted to salvage the 6-gauge jumper cables as the cable itself is in great condition.  So after comparing several replacement clamps, I finally settled on these.  I got two pairs for each end of my jumper cables.Each clamp is copper-coated, has two-piece flexible rubber boots to insulate them, tough teeth, firm spring grip, and has an internal brass crimp sleeve with two pairs of "wings" for your cable secured with a short brass bolt and nut.For my install, I removed the half of the clamp insulating boot and removed the brass crimp sleeve.  After removing all the sleeves, I stripped off about 7/8" of insulator off my cables.  I used ordinary pliers to fold closed one side of the wings on the crimp sleeve, slid the copper wire inside, used large crimp/wire cutter tool to crimp the wings to the wire, folded the opposite set of wings over with pliers, and then crimped everything together.  I made sure it was secure.  I could definitely not pull off the sleeve from the copper wire.Although my crimping was secure, I wanted to ensure a more durable and lasting electrical connection.  So I dabbed a bit of flux compound on the crimped wings of the sleeve and copper wire, turned on my 90 watt soldering iron, and used standard 40/60 rosin-core solder to bind the copper wire and sleeve even further together.  Now, there was no way I could get the sleeve off in one piece even if I wanted to.  Perfect!Now, I just slid the boot through the sleeve and cable, bolted on the sleeve to my new clamp, slid the insulating boot back up from the cable back onto the clamp.  Done!My 6-gauge stranded cable is more than enough for most cars and trucks is probably the minimum thickness for these clamps.  I would not use thinner cable than 6-gauge.  The crimp sleeves can definitely hold thicker copper wire than 6-gauge.I finally have jumper cables to be proud of.  I recommend these great clamps to anyone with medium to heavy duty copper jumper cables they wish to salvage.

Install isn't too bad. Definitely changes the sound of the Duramax, especially under full throttle. You can really hear the V8 now instead of just turbo whistle. Looking at the stock downpipe, it's easy to see why it should be changed.

As of this date mine arrived in perfect condition and is the sought after koyo brand with a small  tyc sticker on the box. This is an incredible deal on a top of the line brand like koyo. Local auto parts stores are double the price and are cheaply made brands not near the quality of koyo.  Glad I found out about this deal from the miata forums they all seam to agree that this is the best replacement radiator for the miata.

This is really a fantastic bracket that bolted right on.  Very well made, clean lines, aluminum, and much better then all the other medal options available.  One of my primary motivators for purchasing this one over the others was that the bolt to attach the light is hidden in the bracket giving it a very clean look.  As mentioned it comes with the necessary screws and will bolt on in just minutes.  I am using mine on a 2015 JKU paired with Rigid Industries D2 Driving Light.  Nice setup, thanks FU![...]

Bright Like Daylight! The supplied wiring harness should be studied before starting unless you're used to this type of project...15 minutes of reading is worth your time.  If using these on a Jeep Wrangler KJ, I found a you-tube that shows an easy "foam fill path" to get the wire through the firewall - the only real challenging part of the job.  The only con is that the "KC" is huge & white...a tad too much for my taste....that being said, I liked them enough to order another set for my front bumper.

The factory rear fender is terribly ugly on the fz-07. This eliminates the whole thing while leaving my stock very bright turn signals on my bike. They have you removing half the stalk making them short and tucked in nicely. I wouldn't normally put a picture with a review but I really like the look if this. If your on the fence just spend the money and use your stock signals.

These caps give you just the right amount to raise your RV for leveling. The cap also gives your tire a smooth service to sit on. It is manufactured by the same company that makes the levelers so its a perfect match. I have a class C and it has held up for over six months in cold and hot weather. Having this on your levelers also help you center your coach correctly and evenly when parking. These will pack in the same bag as the levelers so it won't take more valuable storage space.  Im impressed how solid these are. Excellent quality product.

I just installed the first of these blindspot mirrors on passenger side, which is where I have the most trouble.  I've just returned from a 15 minute test drive. At this point, I'm uncertain about them. When visible they do give a clearer and perhaps larger view and seem to spotlight cars in the blindspot.  But, and it's a major but, a reflection of the interior of the car on the passenger window obscures half of the little mirror.  It's clearly the car and not the device creating the reflection but I'd never noticed it before.  The degree to which it obscures the little mirror depends on the sun and its angle.  If the sun angle is not highlighting the passenger side dash it's less of a problem.  When driving in a shaded area it's not noticeable, but how many freeways are shaded?I'm posting a picture showing this problem.  In the picture it's the bright streak that covers about half of the little mirror.UPDATE a day or two later:  We go to an automatic car wash with some regularity --  the name may be Car Spa.  We went today and the whirling brushes moved the mirror to a place where it's useless.  It seems certain it will happen every time we wash the car.  My wife announced I'm not going to f*** with that little mirror every time I get a car wash.  I tried to get a picture that illustrated it but so far without much success and now I've readjusted the mirror.  I'm adding a picture taken in my garage before I readjusted it but I'm not sure it helps.UPUPDATE: I'm no longer uncertain.  It's another of too many $30 mistakes on Amazon. We went to the same car-wash today as the last time and the little mirror was thrown off entirely.  See picture.  It's now somewhere on the floor in the middle of the car-wash.  So, if you wash your car at a car-wash you don't want this thing.  I'm reducing my rating to 2 stars (instead of 1) because if you don't get your car washed and don't have reflections from inside the car that obscure the view It may work for you.

Fit perfectly! And all I have to say is WOW! I'm being completely honest when I say that, these are SO bright and give the hole SUV a nice modern touch to it (as long as the other lights are LED haha) It clicked right in and worked like a charm, nothing got in the way. I'd HIGHLY recommend getting LEDs for your vehicle if you have the old yellowish color, you seriously won't be disappointed!

Let me start by saying that the product itself is built very well, and looks and feels very durable, and install is pretty easy, even with the minor drilling involved. It would definitely provide great protection for the sway bar disconnect motor found on all Rubicons. The kit comes with a flip bracket, to flip the sway bar motor up a little higher.  Here is where the problems is! Any one who has lifted there Jeep, no doubt has also had to straighten the steering wheel after installing the lift kit. You do this by loosening the clamp bolts and  turning the adjustment sleeve on the drag link until the steering wheel is straight again. The problem is that unless your lucky enough to have the the sleeve and clamp bolts pointing down or towards the back, it will mangle your plug on the sway bar motor when you turn your wheel to the right, due to the new position of the motor. This is exactly what happened to me. I realized I had a problem when my sway bar light started randomly flashing at me while I was driving  a couple of days after installing the skid. Initially I thought that it was just another case of a water damaged sway bar motor that shorted out, but when I crawled underneath to take a look the problem was pretty obvious, the adjusting sleeve bracket/bolts on the drag link mangled and destroyed the big plug attached to the motor. Fortunately I  managed to rig what ever was left of the plug and reattach the the torn out wires, so my motor works as it should again. Unfortunately I still had to order a whole new plug/harness for it because as it sits water will eventually get into the connectors and cause problems. The new plug cost $100.00 plus the time it will take me to replace the old one. Needless to say it is really irritating. Now I have what could have been a really nice skid plate, that is useless. It's hard to believe that I'm the only one that this has happened too, and that Rough Country isn't aware of, or cautions you of this possible big problem! I've added pictures that illustrates what happened. It's ironic that a skid plate that is designed to protect the sway bar disconnect motor, is what ended up damaging it.

Hey everyone, Mike Jones here again with another quick and concise Amazon review.So up today we have the Armor All 77960 Extreme Tire Shine Gel. This gel is some of the best tire shine I have ever used with few exceptions. The kit comes with the gel and the applicator and is as simple to use as it gets. It puts the gel on the tire... thats about it. The gel goes a long way and it is easy to overuse it. About an hour after applying it to your tires you will see it start to even out and really shine. I have used this about 10 times on my low profile 19" tires and I still have about half a bottle left. Good enough for about a years worth of use. The only downside to this stuff is it always seems to spray off into my wheel wells. It is easy to wipe up but even after applying it and letting it sit for 2 days, it still sprayed some on all 4 wheel wells once I drove it.The pros: Good price, easy to use, great shine, holds up for over 2 weeks with a decent high-gloss shine.The cons: The applicator is wonky, they tell you to put the gel into the groove but that didn't work well for me. I just put it on the pad itself and it worked fine. I also wasn't happy with the amount that sprayed off into the wheel well but that comes with the territory I guess.The overall: This product works as intended and provides a good shine. I WOULD buy this product again.I hope you enjoyed this quick review. If so, like my review as helpful. Thanks!_Mike Jones

Not what it's supposed to be. Does not stop surges as it was advertised too. Called progressive industries to ask a question and that's when I found out it was basically a unit that tells you if the electrical was wired up correctly or not, it does not stop surges or protect anything.  For that kind of protection, you need EMS-PT30x or the 50x model. Pic is the unit that has surge, over current, under currrent, wrong wiring, etc.

The best product for white and light colored cars!!! White Light is super easy to apply and it comes off with ease (apply and remove in the shade - as with all waxes and sealants). The depth of color and shine is fantastic! The fact that it also fills minor swirls is an added bonus. I like to alternate this product with wax - one month I wax my car, the next I use White Light - to avoid wax build up. When I do a strip wash once a year, I lay down the White Light first, then two coats of sealant; if I'm not too tired, I'll top that with a final coat of wax. I previously used Black Light until I discovered White Light and now, I make sure to even use it if I'm doing something special on the weekend and want my car to look good. Buy White Light! You will not regret it!!!

I purchased two (2) Trailer Tires & Rims ST205/75D15 F78-15 205/75-15 15" LRC 5 Lug White SpokeSold by: Johnson's Surplus Store on Oct 30, 2015 for my utility trailer. They arrived on Nov 6th, neatly boxed, and ready to be balanced and mounted on my utility trailer.  I also purchased the Maxx Tow Trailer Spare Tire Carrier, and installed it on the tongue of the utility trailer.  I am extremely happy with my purchases.  If I had to offer one suggestion to the seller, that would be to offer to balance the tires and rims before shipping, even if it meant a small extra charge.  This is the only negative remark and suggestion I can make.The Maxx Tow Spare Tire Carrier allows more than sufficient clearance off the ground, and distance from the tow vehicle, and mounts nicely on the trailer's tongue.

These switches work great! The LED is super bright and the switch is very solid for the price. Only complaint was how long it took to get them, but for the price who could argue.

Clay'd my Nissan Frontier.  Only used one clay bar (kit comes with 2) but used nearly the whole bottle of quick detailer.  Works great before applying wax.  Mirror-like finish on black paint.

As expected, the clips were not so useful and the two-side tape is dodgy. But if you don't know that going into the installation, you really need to do more homework. But more significantly, the wiring was (on mine at least) different from the online resources - there were only three wires: black, white, and red. Black was ground and red/white were both power (as in "lights up the lights"). No red wire = power and blue/yellow wires = switch on when at +12V. That was easy enough to figure out though and everything else went about as expected.And they do look really nice, especially for the price.

One of the favorite tools in our arsenal.This is so much better than the old clay bar world - it's faster, covers more area easier, and if you drop it, just wash it off and you are good to go.You'll be surprised how long it lasts. It gives you options that would be difficult before - after you wash and rinse your car, snowfoam it again for lubrication and use this to clay.

All I can say is WOW. Used these to replace the fog Light bulbs in a 2014 Nissan Rogue. The vehicle came with factory HID headlights and standard fogs. These really match the light color of the headlights and look awesome. The diameter of the bulb is thicker then the OEM H11 and a little longer. So make sure your housing can accommodate these bulbs. I just installed these so I can't attest to their longevity however, Their color is as close to HID's without the high price of installing additional relays or ballasts.

It was a replacement for the original OEM over priced filter. It fits on the craftsmen YT3000 21 HP B&S engine 2009 model with no issues no leaksUpdate 5/2018I decided to replace the PH8170 with the Fram PH3614 Extra Guard. It's little bit taller and better made ,plus cheaper. Here in the Midwest we have  a farm and fleet store I found the filter for less than $4. Perfect fit

These lasted a month on my 2007 GMC Yukon.  I think it could have been the electric door putting pressure on the ends when the door closed. I ended up ordering a different brand set. They were a little higher but the shocks are made in America. So far so good with picking a different brand.

Everything went on great.  Two holes in jeep frame (where body mounts fit in) had to be enlarged slightly but none of the other 9 did.  Used a dremel but a file or even sandpaper may have worked well enough as it was just barely too small.  Everything in the kit seems quality.  I installed the transfer case linkage adapter too with not too much trouble.  Biggest pain was that I had to trim my radiator shroud due to the bottom hoses not letting me adjust it to not hit the fan.  To do this, the easiest way was to remove the shroud...so I had to remove the radiator fan to remove the shroud.  Had to "borrow" a fan removal wrench from autoparts store.  Once this was off, trimming radiator fan shroud was easy.  Then the other PITA was my gas filler tube didn't reach the filler housing anymore by .5 inches.  The hose had to be loosened so I could pull the filler neck out more, but my hose was old and stuck on.  I just bought a new hose and removed the old one.Oh, and if you have rocker guards/ panels that use the old body mounts (which needed trimmed), you will have to trim your new body mounts in the same location.  Not a problem at all, i used a good kitchen knife to cut the poly bushings down 3/16".So, as far as the kit goes, it was great.  It was the other things that had to be adjusted/ altered that were the real pain.  No fault of the kit, as it did exactly what it was said to do and the instructions warned of the other issues.  Guess these things come with the territory when installing a body lift.Everything is good now, got 31's on with no rubbing.  Looks great.  I would highly recommend this kit for a 1" body lift over the ones that just add pucks.  New bolts, new mounts, cant beat that.

These socket organizers are the best i've ever use...no BS ...do yourself a favor and order them. They are way solid and smooth...and the price is cheap for the quality.  They hold a whole rack of 1/2" impact deep sockets and no flex, ZERO FLEX, yet they're light and slide easily.  The are made from some kind of high grade extruded aluminum and nicely anodized. That's why i bought more in 3/8 and 1/4 . Sockets don't fall off but you don't have to fight to get them off either. I'm very happy with these, in fact, this sale is me coming back here and buying more 1/4 and 3/8 to replace all my others...make life easier.  Also, If they don't fit in a drawer or box, you can easily shorten them with a cut off wheel and slide the rubber end back on.  Someone said they wish the 1/4 came with more clips for more 1/4 sockets.  Yes, maybe they should offer a pack of the plastic slide clips, but I cant ding them for that. It's not often you get something this solid and nice for a cheap price.

These are sweet and look great. The white is for sure 6k and will match your 6k HID or LED bulbs. They give a sleek look to your ride. Only draw back for me is I don't think the Orange is as bright as it could be even though they are just as bright as halogens. Maybe it because after staring at the white in aw and then flipping them over I might have been slightly blinded. So for any one on the edge about buying these bulbs just do it. You won't be disappointed.

Made well enough for the money.I bought the large case at first ( what amazon lists as 10" x 12", Large ), way too big for my Battery Tender Plus ( 021-0128 )1.25a charger.I do have two of them, and a 12ft extension cable for each (and the ring terminal cable which I haven't used, but want to keep with each charger), plenty of room.But wanted to store each by itself , so bought 2 mediums cases ( what amazon list as 6" x 8", Medium ) .No problem fitting a Battery Tender Plus 1.25a charger in there by itself, with the cables it comes with.But it's getting tight when adding the output 12ft extension cable into the medium case...And the large case is just to large for 1  Battery Tender Plus 1.25a charger, unless you have lots of optional cables.With the output 12ft extension cable (p/n 081-0148-12 ).....So better snug as a bug in the medium case I guess... just make sure you have some twisty ties to keep the 120Vac power cord and output cord in order as you try and stuff them in three. Otherwise it's like wrangling arms from an octopus trying to get the zipper closed.The pictures are with the medium case, Battery Tender Plus ( 021-0128 ), the 12ft extension cable, and the un-used ring lug cable. Hope the pictures help, these are the type of pictures I was looking for when deciding what size to get....

These lights are awesome. I added them to my 2010 f150. The stock back up lights just weren't cutting it for me. I was able to mount these without drilling any holes. (If you have the fx4 style painted bumper there are 4 bolts holding the bumper in place. I used these. Kept the spacing perfect)I wired these to a custom upfitter switch. I can turn them on only if I need them.The lights them selfs feel solid. They are really bright and look great.I have two little complaints that arnt a huge deal.First off the pigtail coming off the lights is really short. I wish it was a bit longer. Not a huge deal.Second. With my method of mounting I had to mount the bracket then mount the lights to the bracket. The lights don't have any threading, you have to place a small nut into a slot. I was in a extremely awkward angle under the tuck trying to accomplish this. If you used the provided hardware this is not an issue. You can assemble the light in the comfort of your living room.Over all they are a really solid light for a small price. My buddy ordered a set for his 250 after seeing them installed.

I haven't had the opportunity to install these yet, but out of the box, I have quality concerns. The Bushwacker logo is upside down on both panels. See photo. If I could remove the logo sticker without damaging the plastic, that would be great. I could certainly live without the logo. My concern is, damaging the plastic trying to remove the logo. My other concern is, if Bushwackers quality control didn't catch their own logo being upside down, what else got past them. Basically I mean that I am a bit afraid that the quality maybe lacking, if they miss something like this.On a positive note, the textured plastic looks great and a nice match to the OEM plastic fenders and bumpers.UPDATE: I decoded to exchange the defective ones and try again. Thankfully the new ones came with the logo right side up. Installation was pretty straight forward. Just follow the directions carefully. One thing that would be nice is if they would simply number the two sided tapes for you. They suggest that you number them in the order that they should be pulled, but nothing I had would write on the plastic tape. I tried ball point pens, Sharpies, even pencel. Nothing would write on it. Anyway, I think they look really nice installed on the Jeep. They give it a nice finished look that it was lacking.

Does not work like the ROLL ON MATS...!Don't be fooled, its nothing more than a rubberized undercoating!I sprayed 3 heavy coats on a "front desk" type of bell, and the bell would still ring, ALTHOUGH it was SLIGHTLY DAMPENED.AND, the spray coats covered almost HALF OF THE BELL.I did the SAME TEST with a SMALL 1 inch square of NOICO 80 MIL MAT, and the bell would NOT RING, it would just go "THUD"..!I also compared it to DYNAMAT, and the result was the same.DYNAMAT and NOICO had the very same results in ALL of my tests!So, HALF of the bell and it still rings, although not as loud. VERSUS 1 SQUARE INCH of rubber mat, and the bell WILL NOT RING!Thats almost a 5 to 1 ratio, and the product still will NOT DEADEN SOUNDS, after 3 thick coats. Who wants to waist their time with this crap? NOT ME!I have posted some pics of the 2 bells that I tested, EVERYTHING was bought on AMAZON!!

customTaylor33 is my go to rim tape!  Questions are answered promptly, and in a friendly manner, making customer service outstanding.I have the special edition baby blue tape on my scooters, silver on my Moto Guzzi, and black on my husband's Honda.  So far the tape has survived a Phoenix summer, and still looks like new.Application is easy if you take your time, and follow the instructions.  I found it handy to have a sharp xacto blade ready for trimming off the tail on the last section.  Don't try to cut the tape by pressing down with the blade as you'll scratch your rim, place the blade where you want to cut, then pull the tape up against the blade, and it will slice easily.The darker image shows the black tape, with the special edition baby blue in the background, and the daytime image is of the silver.Note: The photos auto rotated upon upload, and I couldn't correct the orientation.

With 180,000 miles on my Silverado, it's hood was scratched up a little just from normal every day driving so I threw this on there to add a little aesthetic too and it looks great! Wish I would've had one of these from day one. Installation took about 5 minutes, I recommend having someone hold it in place while you put the first screws in.

After purchasing my 05 Saab 9-2x Aero (05 WRX) I noticed it came with some piston slap probably from the previous owner only using 5w20 in the car which is too thin. I went with motul 5w40 after talking to a few Subaru mechanics who put it in all cars that come through their shops. It helped my piston slap. It is quieter and goes away quicker than the old oilNo complaints!

It works but not industrial strength.  Good price, not good quality.  Two of the screw terminals came loose and the nut dropped inside the unit.  The plastic on the socket base is not well made and does not support the nut. I was able to retrieve the nut and get it back together.  The metal strip is all that is holding the connection in place.  See the picture.  Use with caution and care, or maybe better to solder to the relay directly.  We'll see how long this lasts.

Looked exactly as displayed on the site.The two round units within the oblong faceplate can be rotated so that the faceplate can be installed in any rotation.Voltmeter works great.The USB outlet is about 1.5" from front to back, so it was easily installed in the 1/2" ply wooden front of our NAV station, but the voltmeter is only about 1/2" from front to back, so the retaining ring would not attach. I figured it would be ok to glue it in place, that worked great.The USB outlet has an issue, if I push a USB plug all the way into the the USB outlet, the green light goes out and the power to the USB cable is zero. But easing the plug out of the outlet slightly re-establishes the power outlet and my tablet charges up just fine. (I only tried plugging into the 2Amp outlet as my Samsung tablet groans if I use the other USB outlets that I have plugged into typical auto 12 outlets in the boat.Easy to hookup, the package included securing screws and 4 electrical tab connectors. I ran 12v +ve and -ve lines to the USB outlet and then a jumper for each from the USB outlet to the voltmeter, joining the wires inside the tab connectors.The kit included 1 cover, one for the USB but I decided not to use it.UPDATE 11/05/2015The supplier read my previous review and contacted me by email. After clarifying what was wrong with the USB device, they did not hesitate to send me a new one.The new one arrived on 11/03/2015 and I installed it yesterday. The new one worked perfectly.That kind of customer service is what I expect and am happy to report that I am very happy with the outcome.

Very bad quality. Upper waterproof covering just peels off after some months, even if you keep the motorcycle in a garage. Holding straps are frequently braking off. After a short time the cover is peeling and letting water into your cargo. Get a decent tail trunk, don't waste your money on this one.

I was a little scared by the reviews claiming this is "cheap ... garbage". I wonder, though, if these folks know they need to use a relay. This switch like the rest on the interior of your car and their associated wires are for running low power items and relays that switch your high powered devices like off-road lights.To make the switch light up with the dash lights, I tapped the green wire (NOT the green with white) off of the FJ Cruiser's "diff. lock" switch. See photo.I was delighted to discover that this switch has two separate internal lighting circuits. Assuming you connect the light input to your dash lights, the "ZOMBIE LIGHTS" text lights up when your lights are on. The biohazard symbol lights up when the switch is on assuming you wired your supply to the right lead. I don't remember which of the two was correct but it's probably the green based on the diagram.I used this wire harness with relay:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/MICTUNING-Heady-Duty-2-Lead-14-ft-LED-Light-Bar-300-Watt-Wiring-Harness-Off-Road-SUV-Jeep-40-Amp-Relay-ON-OFF-ILLUMINATE-ROCKER-SWITCH/dp/B00WMPGLYU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">MICTUNING Heady Duty 2 Lead 14 ft LED Light Bar 300 Watt Wiring Harness Off Road SUV/Jeep - 40 Amp Relay ON/OFF ILLUMINATE ROCKER SWITCH</a>

Used on 2003 Boxster, 1968 Camaro with C5 Corvette brakes, 1997 Camaro, and 2004 Chevy truck, had 2 adapters.  Worked very well.  No leaks, no mess.  The adapter we bought for the GM brakes had 2 different thicknesses for the cap to help seal, a nice touch that helped, we used both.  We did install a check valve, see picture I posted.  We found that 10-15 psi was plenty.  Brakes feel really firm!

Horrible product that doesnt last. I needed 2 out of the five pads to polish my car. One pass with the orange, and the second pass with the white pad. The orange pad began to fail before I could finish my first pass over the car, so I switched the the less abrasive pad, the white pad earlier than I wanted. This began to fail too. Microscopic pieces of both pads began to fly off as the Velcro attachment backing plate began failing. Both pads broke off the Velcro and I still had over half the car to polish. I ended up using the black pad, which was too soft for the polish I was using and the results I wanted. I would not buy these pads ever again. See the attachments below. Do not buy.

I am really impressed with this bed liner kit. It is simple and easy to apply. Kit comes with the 1 gallon can of bed liner, two foam roller applicators, roller and handle, 2" paintbrush, and scouring pad to prep the bed surfaces.The only thing I did not like about the kit was the foam roller applicators. They worked great for game most part but they would start to wear out on the edges and little foam pieces would fall off and get stuck in the wet bed liner.A few tips for a professional job: make sure you prep thoroughly with the scour pad or 120-150 grit sandpaper (just enough to scuff the paint but not removing the primer base all the way to bare metal). I used 120 grit sandpaper for the entire job. Another important tip is masking and cover up. Make sure you use a quality masking tape for this stuff, it will save you a lot of time in the long run. Once you have masked off and applied the bed liner, take a rag with some acetone and wipe down the tape seam so that you don't have to run a razor down your swam later on, this makes pulling the tape up, exponentially easier! Gives you a better finished line too.A third tip would be to strive for evenness. This is some pretty thick stuff so you'll want to make sure it doesn't run or glob. Make sure to constantly stir the can while working too. The product has gritty stuff in it so you'll want to stir it up pretty good to keep it suspended in the medium.Also, when using the brush, rather than using a painting motion, just dab it aggressively to keep the textured feel that the rollers give.Cleanup is important to do right away with acetone and wearing old clothes and rubber gloves is a must! I got some of this stuff on my arm and it's still on me three days later.I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a superior bed liner for the price!

Identical replacement for the tank on my 95 F150 4X4. Fit perfect. I replaced both tanks and fuel pumps on my truck and so far am happy with all the Spectra products.

These lights are very bright. I would estimate 30-50% brighter than a standard 1157 incandescent bulb. They are long and might not fit in every lens configuration.

The spring fits tight and mounts right up to my hardware and my antenna. I went cheap with my first antenna and didn't buy the spring within the first two weeks I snapped my antenna off at the base and had to buy a new antenna. Don't be cheap by this spring. 1995 Wrangler.

Seems to do what it says. Lots of battery thefts around here. Installed this in no time at all. Keyed easily to my ignition key.  I have an automatic so the cooler prevents access from behind like some worry about. Better yet, I got a mesh grille insert that keeps anyone from attempting to defeat the lock the way some claim.Nice having the added security.I did buy the $28 large rivet gun that it requires, but I'll surely find other things to rivet in the future. Even with the tool this is less expensive than the mopar.

My goodness this light is bright! Should be noted that I do have 1 led placement that is not centered (not that big of deal to me). I should also note that the picture shows the old style floods on the outside of the bar, when i asked i was told i received the newer style flood in the bar which has larger pods (i cant tell the size difference between spot and floods) but, for the confusion the seller did compensate me for the confusion. I did not end up using the wire harness and rocker switch as i have factor auxiliary lighting switches but, the wiring looks to be about the same as any other typical wiring harness from any other company and does have good length. Overall i would purchase again from the seller and purchase other mictuning lights based on my experience.Update: Ive now had the light installed less than 6 months. Had wash/ foam cannon my truck every other week and hand dry. Well we are now in the wet season here in the pacific northwest and ive had to post an updated pic, little bummed out about it. I am in the process of figuring out the warranty as ive seen some say theyve had bad experiences with the seller and being charged to return it or not hearing from them at all.

I was certain based on other reviews these would be a great add on for my 14' JKU Rubi.  Install was extemley easy, took maybe 20 minutes.Hood is locked down super tight, no highway movement at all.  They also look great.Can't go wrong!

VHT engine enamel is the right stuff.  I used it before, and used it again.  Painting the air cooled aluminum engine on my motorcycle...I wanted something that wouldnt flake or peel.  So, I turned to VHT, I cleaned the engine thoroughly w acetone, then sprayed the VHT engine enamel primer, engine paint, engine clear coat.  They all sprayed on smooth and the gloss is slick and shiny.  It is a must to follow the instructions on the can...this paint must be cured properly! (it is very fragile before curing and tough after)  More than two years and 2000 miles on Illinois chip & tar roads.  I couldn't be happier.

Generator arrived damaged due to being dropped or bounced hard somewhere along the route.. The frame under the generator was bent, and is clearly not designed strong enough for the extra force received during shipment. This was not noticed until the unit was turned on its side to install the wheels.  I hammered the frame back just enough so that the support bracket could be attached.  Added oil, hooked up LP tank, and it started and ran just fine. Had no problem running a 1800 Watt Hair dryer. The unit was not as loud as I was expecting, about like a lawnmower. It is BIG! The black and yellow panel is plastic and flexes when plugging in. This should be stronger. As noted in other reviews, unlike what you would expect, (and what the instructions state) the unit does not shut off using the off switch. You must shut off the fuel for it to shut down.  Also, as an electrical engineer, It is hard to understand why there is no main breaker. The lack of a main breaker combined with the non-functioning "off" switch means you may need to unplug your load and plug it back in every time you power cycle the generator else risk sending bad startup and shutdown voltages to your stuff. The outside of the box says there is a voltage suppressor, however there is no mention if this in the documentation.  Even my low end Wen generator has a main breaker. Despite what the web page says about being able to monitor power output, the "intellisense" display only reports voltage, frequency, and run time. There is no way to determine power output since it does not report watts or even amps. Generally, good instructions otherwise. No info in the documentation about hooking it up to Natural Gas or obtaining a conversion kit. I Will be contacting Champion regarding the damage.---------------------------------------------Update: Champion support person who seemed a bit UN-interested in the details of my problem  said to just return it. I initiated the return. Amazon will send another one and the carrier will pick up the old one at the same time for the return at no charge.---------------------------------------------Update: New unit arrived (although late) in good condition, and the old unit was taken away. Went through the same steps to install wheels, stand, add oil etc. Hint, a bright flashlight makes adding the oil easier. Cranked up on propane and all is well. Note: on propane, it actually helps to read the instructions and follow the choke guidelines. There is a little bit of art to getting this thing cranked up on propane, but once you learn it, it usually starts on the first try. I noted that the unit shuts off pretty quickly after closing either of the propane valves. Next update will be after our annual Hurricane. Be sure to turn the battery power switch off when storing. It has a light in it that will drain the battery just that much faster is you leave it on. Note, Despite the all-American sounding name, these are Chinese Generators. For your reference, this was 879 bucks when I bought it.---------------------------------------------Update: Exchange date + 2 weeks; Notified that I need to return the original or face getting charged for it. Well, once the return got on the shippers truck, nobody seems to know anything about it. Should have taken video of them loading it. Amazon special handling is working  to figure out what is going on.---------------------------------------------Update: Despite 2 extended calls to special handling where I was assured that I would not be charged again, sure enough, a new charge appeared on my credit card for the generator that was never returned by the trucking company. Another call to Amazon cleared this up and the charge was reversed without any hassle. Generator is waiting for this year's hurricane. Lesson learned: If you have to return something like this, be sure to get paperwork, and take photos of it being loaded onto the truck.

I purchased these springs for my 2001 Ford Excursion diesel, but they will also fit 99 - 04 Ford Superduty trucks. Although these are supposed to raise an F250 / F350 about two inches to level it out, because the Excursion sits lower from the factory, they provided a full 5 inches of lift. The ride is firm, but not harsh. For the price, these can't be beat.... especially with Amazon's free shipping !! Thank  you Pro Comp.

I've been using a roof mounted luggage rack the past few trips we've taken and for freeing up storage inside the vehicle, it was great.  However, the hit to my gas mileage was very noticeable (avg. 30 mpg without, 20 mpg with).  So after reading quite a few reviews, I decided to give a hitch mounted cargo carrier a try.  The MaxxHaul was one of the more reasonably priced carriers with a decent weight rating.  I was specifically looking for one that had the raised frame so that luggage was less likely to slide around, or fall off the rack.It comes in a decent sized box, and there are about 7 pieces in total that you have to assemble (might be a few more if you count the support bars as extra pieces).  Assembly is pretty simple.  Line up the main bar in the center and the right/left cages on either side.  Run the bolts through to the center piece and tighten them down by hand so everything stays together.  Add the support pieces to hold the left and right sides together at the top and then tighten all the bolts down.  Finally, add the two reflectors and you are ready to roll.On a side note, make sure you put the metal where the reflectors mount, towards the back.  I wasn't paying attention the first time and mounted them backwards.  Took about 5 minutes to unscrew the nuts and bolts to fix, but simpler to avoid doing it wrong to begin with!The size is excellent.  I can fit a full sized Igloo cooler as well as a large suitcase beside each other lengthwise.  In the attached picture, under the tarp (in case it rains), the cooler is on the left, the suitcase is laying flat on it's back on the right and I have a lawn cultivator behind the cooler and coming across the top of the suitcase, which is the bulge hanging off the right.  Next time we travel, we'll be packing a few more suitcases, so I'll put them on their sides so I can fit at least 2 in the carrier (maybe all 3, I haven't measured yet) and then one on top of the others.The carrier has a little weight to it, but it's still light enough that you can easily carry it or lift it up to the top shelf for storing when not in use.  To test the durability, I installed it in the hitch of my vehicle, stepped up on it and then took a couple good jumps.  I'm a pretty good sized guy (won't share my exact weight on here, but let's just say it's enough that I'm on a regular diet), but the carrier felt extremely sturdy.  I was actually more worried I was going to damage my vehicle than the carrier.When the carrier is first installed, without any luggage to add weight, it rattles around a bit.  I was a little concerned that this would happen while I was driving and create a lot of road noise.  I had looked at ordering a stabilizer, but it wouldn't have been delivered in time for the trip, so I decided to go without and see what happened.  I'm happy to report that by just adding a single, fully packed suitcase, it puts enough weight on the hitch so that it doesn't create any noise or rattling while driving.The only reason that I knocked a single star off is because the power coating wasn't done very well.  I had 2 different spots that were not well covered and had a slight hint of rust starting to develop.  It was easy to do some light sanding to remove the rust and then I used a metal spray paint to cover those spots without any issues, but would have liked to have seen a nice, even powder coat over the whole carrier right when I took it out of the box initially.Overall, this is a fantastic carrier and has exceeded my expectations in terms of durability.  My gas mileage on my last trip averaged just shy of 29 mpg, so very little loss since there is no direct wind drag being mounted on the back.  If you are looking for a hitch mounted carrier, I would definitely recommend this one, you just might need to do a little touch up painting if yours was like mine.

I love the look of this bug shield. I've heard of these coming loose on people while driving. I haven't had any problems yet, but I'll definitely keep a close eye on it. The hardest thing about install is getting everything straight. I did a couple of dry fits before actually installing because a crooked deflector would have annoyed me to no end. All things aside, this deflector add a sleek look to the front of my truck, and I am happy with it thus far.

If you want this because it looks cool, do NOT get it!I ordered this specifically because it did not have the word "PIVOT" on the button, if you look at the images of the product. Not only did it come with the word "pivot" underneath "start engine", the button came slightly angled. I will post pictures so you know what I mean. After reading the good reviews I decided to try it. I really wanted this to look cool in my car, but I was really disappointed. The reviews where they say it is really cheap, they mean it. The aluminum definitely looks and feels really cheap, the relay box as well feels like cheap plastic. I figure something that is suppose to handle the amount of power to start my car would be sturdier, no? I would not install a crooked button in my car, especially with some weird "pivot" company logo on it that I know nothing about.1 star because of the false advertising, the pictures are misleading, and the button was angled. I didn't even take apart my car to try to install this to see if it works, so I can't comment on that.Perhaps not all the buttons they are sending out are crooked, and some people may not care about the feel of this product (thin plastic), but just be aware that the word pivot is on the button, and the images make it look way more professional than it really is.

I ordered this as a 'center piece' for the exhaust filler plate on my Corvette to give it a different look and to show my pride in being an Air Force veteran.  The quality is great, it was a perfect fit and I love the look.  The only thing I had to do was replace the adhesive tape with a better 3M two sided tape due to the textured surface I was mounting it on.  It has been on now for a few months and some long distance trips and it still looks great.

Exactly what it says it is. Extends up to 11", the four holes give you several choices for how much extension you need however the two holes on the receiver hitch part are the more useful, only one of the holes on the receiver part of this extension was useable to me. The package states that this is for use as a bike carrier extension only.Update to my review. There seems to be several questions about the hole spacing and overlap, I measured mine and have included a drawing of the dimensions. Hopefully this will help.

Really not worth the money.  I have 3 in my boat.  They will run the fridge and the stereo for a short time but no longer than cheap lead acid batteries.  I had another Odyssey fail in my car after 6 months.  Amazon defers you to the manufacturer.  Odyssey will give you the runaround for weeks, require load testing, receipts, multiple emails and calls.  Then offer you at best a mailed replacement even if you already had to purchase another in the meantime.  I shop alot online butI would advise anyone from buying these Odysseys online.  It's just to difficult when you have a problem.

Great replacement cover. I liked the smoke better than the original opaque. Even though it looks dark, it lets some light in. Some here say the plastic is thin. Yes, it is thinner than our OEM cover. But it appears to be sufficient to last a long time. The hinge is simple, bendable metal. Removal is done by bending the curved piece at the end of the hinge and sliding the cover towards the opposite side. Install is the same idea; When you have it in place, you simply bend the little end piece into a small curly-cue and that keeps the hinge from sliding out either way. CONFIRM FITMENT. The description of the vent lid could have had more specifications. Many here ask about sizing. The manufacturer refers to this cover as a 14x14 size. That alone won't give you much confidence that you have the right cover. I have included pics to help you confirm this will work on your unit. I also installed a new vinyl seal. Ventline #BVD0455-01, 51" length. Overall, I was very satisfied with the new cover and it's a terrific value. Saved plenty of money and time over taking it to the RV dealer.

These were a direct replacement for the OEM airbag shocks on my 2003 Escalade. These were packaged very well and outside of the box looked to be of very good quality. The bags themselves on the shock seemed to be made more of a rubber material then the OEM's rubber/canvas material but I have no reasonable expectations for these to fail due to their design.  I had these installed in 15 minutes per side and only needed to make one modification. The electrical plug at the top of the new shock was about a 1/2 longer than the OEM one so I needed notch the corner of the air compressor housing. The housing is made for a thicker steel so for those with dremels, its a snap to make the notch. If not, then you will need to remove the air compressor itself and notch the box with a hack saw. I am fine with this as they are aftermarket and there will always be some degree of customizing to get some parts to work. I will report back for a long term update in a few months.

This is great stuff. I purchased to use on the interior of my son's Jeep Wrangler and we sprayed it yesterday. It goes on smooth and easy. I have a medium sized compressor (6.6cfm @ 40PSI) and it had no problem spraying the entire interior. It looked so good we decided to do the grill and front of the fenders. I used three bottles. Highly recommended.I'll try to remember to post a follow up in a few months with how it wears.

Used these to change fuel filters on my 2015 Ram.  Worked great but keep reading.  My supplier fixed problem with first paper fuel filter sent which had a major defect because the inner membrane was not attached thus useless as a filter (see picture.) Mopar and Cummings on box (MO-291, 68157291AA). The problem was that I did not look at the OEM part before I was ready to put it in and had to abort the filter change until the replacement filter arrived.  My supplier had it replaced in 2 days... Excellent job! But still a major pain and waste of time since I had already removed the old filter before noticing.  I hope your dealer's mechanic inspects filters before installing.  Front paper filter next to engine was easy and relatively clean to replace especially because detailed instructions and O-ring included.  I used 1 1/8 socket on my 1/2 inch drive ratchet to get the cover off which was barely enough leverage to get it undone from the factory (way more than 22.5 ft-lb tight.) After minor skinned knuckles all went together well.  Rear filter near middle and next to fuel tank was not as cleanly done.  The filter did not drain as well through the drain stop-cock and splashed diesel all over while removing.  Mopar and Cummings on box (MO-867, 68197867AB). You will need channel locks and a big filter wrench to remove the filter and the O-rings are again supplied but there is no sheet of instructions. Still just remove and replace.  I ran the fuel pump 10 times (cycled the switch) after install before starting and have not had any problems.  Again inspect the front paper fuel filter before starting.  It's not hard change these filters yourself but there is a small mess to clean up and don't get fuel splashed in your face.

Work great. You have to test it before you assemble your dash back together. If some don't light up just flip them 180 degrees. I had to do it 3 times till I made them all turn on. I only used 6 out of the 10. One didn't work but for the price I'm not complaining. Dim does not work tho. Idk if it's just these or on all LED products

I purchased this for my cracking, flaking, you name it steering wheel that has seen better days. The previous owner didn't really take care of the car and instead of buying another universal slip on cover like I previously did... I thought I would get a steering wheel wrap, instead. Shipping took 1 week, which actually is longer than usual for prime members. However, I didn't mind since the product turned out to be perfect! The product packing is a small zip pouch with 1x steering wheel wrap, 2x threads, and 2x needles. The wrap fits snuggly on my 15" outside diameter steering wheel with a 4" grip circumference. I decided not to use the existing thread already sewed on the wrap to stitch with. Instead, I used both needles and did a baseball stitch using the existing holes. Remember to pull tight, the wrap will stretch and the two ends will come together, making a tight seem. I decided to tuck the ends around the spoke areas and did a weave stitch for a more finished look. With all that stitching, I only used 1 thread and didn't need to use the other. If you have the patience, you to can do this. I made sure to take my time and even then, there were times I had to un-thread and re-thread. Glad I did though, because I'm very happy with the turn out.

Works great on the top of our new UTV. I even ordered a couple more for one of our fire trucks for scene lighting. Easy to install with adjustable brackets.

Just installed it today and so far so good. My 2000 F150's original handle gave up and pulled apart. I ordered this one as a replacement. And installed it today. It seemed like a nice fit and the lock was an easy transfer. For my install the I needed a T30 bit, 10mm socket, a ratchet, and a small flathead screwdriver to pull the lock retainer spring off. I also used silicone spray lubricant to spray everything since I was in there. 10 minute job. So far so good and I will update the review if it has any issues later.

It took me about an hour to install. The only tools you need are some extensions, universal joint, 14mm 12mm & 10mm. I did a quick YouTube search and found where someone had replaced it. Essentially loosen the 14mm & 12mm and then the 10mm is the tensioner. Removed the plug and the power cord. Pryed the old one out.As for the fitment issue. On the car on the drivers side there is a metal sleeve that goes in and out to adjust to intolerances of other alternators. All you need to do is take a socket. Put the back of the socket to the sleeve and tap it out untill it is then flush with the mount. When you install in reverse order and tighten the 14mm bolt. It will snug that sleeve back to the alternator.My old alternator was only putting out correct voltage over 2,000 rpm. Below 2,000 it was not outputting any voltage. Not a problem for the 120 highway miles I drive a day. But driving around town and quick stops was proving a problem. After this install I was able to instantly see on first start up via my Scanguage II that I was getting 14.1 volts no matter the RPM.As for delivery and packaging. I ordered on a Thursday night at about 9pm and by 1pm Saturday Amazon had delivered. The delivery was who I assume the same people that do the Prime Now deliveries. They delivered and I had a picture of the package within the app.This brand new alternator was cheaper then buying a reman at a local store. There was also no core charge. Amazon yet again wins my business.

I'm a hobbyist car detailer... And an avid one. I never appreciated the company of a "good" microfiber until I started searching for prices. If you're a detailer, forget the cheap 50 pack and 100 pack deals you'll find online, as they're likely crappy rags. For detailing paint you want to be looking at 350gsm minimum. Otherwise, you're just using twice or thrice the rag you need to.I was skeptical about these rags at first. Someone said in the questions that they are 363gsm, which must've been calculated manually because I can't find any gsm spec. Anyhow, I was initially worried.Received the rags and was first amazed at the size. 1616 didn't sink in until I saw them! These are great size. The plushness and thickness is excellent. Better than any cheap microfiber you will find at a value store.These are also 80% polyester 20% polyamide.Highly recommended for detailing.

Worth the money. Have it on my 2003 Silverado 1500 extended cab and don't regret it at all. Been there almost 3 years and no problem. You will need a module to have it fully functional. The G5 comes with a proximity sensor, glass sensor, tilt sensor, blue led indicator, a loud siren and the blackjax that's a kill switch. Yes it does lack looks and style compared to newer ones, but it's one of the most and best alarm I have ever owned. Never had an issue with it. Why pay for looks when it won't work as intended, with this your ride will be protected to the max and isn't likely that anyone will try to steal your car.

Put these on a brand new 2017 Explorer. Fitment was great, but if you have the windows that auto-roll down when they sense an obstruction, these aren't for you, they just won't work without modifying the rubber weather stripping. Also, the 3M tape that came on these was put on very sloppy and the back window deflectors had the tape on the wrong side.

So, I though this was the OEM for a 03-05 Range Rover Full Size. It is not.It fits, even looks perfectly the same as the OEM, and works well. But somebody on the RR forum said that these start falling apart after a while; I am starting to see signs of this happening after a few months.They wipe well, but already start making plopping noises. Today I took a good look at them, and noticed that they are already starting to move in their mounts a little; see picture. I guess next time I'll go back to the dealer.

Sharp looking wheels. They are more of a grey color than pictured. The finish looks much like that of a teflon non-stick pan. It's not a bad looking color and the finish seems really strong, just be advised if you are expecting a wheel that is truly black. Also check your bore diameter in comparison to the 108mm of these wheels. I had to put hubcentric spacers in to correct a vibration at highway speeds.

I had high expectations for this TPMS aftermarket tool. My wife works 3 short blocks from home so unless it's winter cold or raining/snowing, she walks. One day I happened to be buying gas (rarely) and I noticed the right rear tire was really low. A quick check showed about 15psi. Found the nail, got it repaired but wondered what else I could do. I bought this in August ( today is 12/6). First set DOA. The customer service was great and sent a new kit out the next day. LF died 3 months later. I waited another month. Got it today. Dead out of the box. My patience is gone and Amazon reimbursed me. You must be lucky if yours worked and kept working. See attached photo FL=0 RR gives no output.

Install was smooth, instructions were pretty easy to follow. My wife and I put it together in about an hour and a half in 65 weather and it was not bad. It's perfect for what we wanted a cheaper topper for! No need for a fiberglass topper for us.

works like a charm.  doesn't say "Kohree" in white on the side though like in the pictures?  honestly that was a plus for me, so no worries.  the spot & flood are controlled independently (each has it's own power wire, the blue is the floods which are the top row).  i used the 3-position Rigid Industries rocker switch & have it wired so the top row of floods come on alone, or i can hit the other way & the floods/spots both come on.  i only tested in the driveway, but it looks like it should throw pretty far & spill pretty good.  i only mounted using 1 of the 2 mounting points & it feels plenty sturdy.  if it's gonna get bumped or stepped on, it should do fine if you used both mounting points.  the bracket where you put the bolts for the up/down tilt seems like garbage pot metal that will strip out easily if you were to over tighten.  the rest seems beefy though, the brackets that mount to the boat, or the vehicle or whatever are thick & strong.  the cord has a nice rubber grommet that looks like it should prevent water intrusion.  i have it mounted on a jon boat that will go in saltwater during rainstorms, so time will tell...

I used two of these to replace 36 feet of fluorescent tubes in a monument sign.  The old ballast had given up the magic smoke and the cost to replace it is not cheap.  So, a good opportunity to increase energy efficiency while at the same time increasing lifespan.The tubes ran horizontally in three rows across the sign so I set these up to fire horizontally opposed.  I've seen these on vehicles and been rather impressed with the light throw and hoped that I would get great results.  I got just OK results.  The sign is 12 feet wide and 3 feet tall.  The light from these petered out at around 4 feet so the center of the sign is a bit darker than I would like.  In hindsight I would have gone with 5050 light strips run across the inside of the sign.  Oh well, when the other side craps out, I get a second chance.

I have a 2012 BMW X5 35d (diesel) and of course, BMW does their very best to make sure the end user does nothing on their own and pays all the service $$ to the BMW dealer, even warning the driver in the owners manual against something as simple as adding DEF (diesel exhaust fluid). It's also a LOT of money at the BMW dealer - well over $100 including tax for the fill when your maintenance plan finally runs out. With the Peak BlueDEF, I accomplished the refill for about $45 and I could have done it for about $20 if I didn't buy the two screw on 1/2 gallon no spill bottles that I really didn't need.The Peak BlueDEF fluid was on sale $8.68 + tax for a 2.5 gallon bottles on sale at the local Walmart so I bought two of them. As I mentioned, I also bought two of the screw on dispenser bottles that hold 1/2 gallon of the urea fluid but you don't really need it because all it does is eliminate spillage and they are slower to empty than the 2.5 gallon bottle.I emptied about 2/3 of the first 1/2 gallon screw on bottle into the first of the two BMW DEF fluid tanks on the X-5 and it drained slowly and then stopped when full. I unscrewed the top of the empty 1/2 gallon bottle and refilled it with the BlueDEF from Peak until the 2.5 gallon bottle was empty, refilling the main #2 tank under the air intake in the engine compartment. You could just fill both tanks directly from the BlueDEF bottle - it has a long pour spout but I was curious to know exactly how much liquid was required per mileage driven so I measured it out in the 1/2 gallon screw on press and fill bottles.The Peak Blue DEF fluid meets the exact requirements specified by BMW - 32.5% urea and 62.5% deionized water that also meets the ISO 22241 specification.Bottom line is that the Peak BlueDEF product meets BMW specs (it likely meets ALL diesel DEF specs), it's as easy as windshield washer fluid to fill, it's not really toxic or corrosive from what I read but it can tarnish brass. I got some on my hand and washed it off with water without incident.I think it's nearly criminal of BMW to make all of this so cloak and dagger and make it appear that you need to be a master mechanic in German car repair to add this fluid. Don't go for that BS.So the plan moving down the road is to simply refill the DEF tanks every 5,000 miles so I never get the idiot light telling me I have 1,000 miles to go before the X5  won't start. The Peak BlueDEF is a great product at a great price and it's easy to refill.

Yeah, I'm actually giving this 4 stars. We all know it doesn't look like the chrome on your bumper and I think we all know nothing in a rattle can probably ever will. But this stuff isn't bad. I just bought a darn nice, low mileage Jaguar XKR convertible but the OEM wheels were nothing to write home about. They just had the OEM paint, a plain old, boring, rather subdued silver gray and 3 of them had quite a case of curb rash as well. (Really amazes me how someone could have a car this nice and this expensive and take this sloppy care of it - in less than 40k miles!) They really took away from the look of a beautiful car and my first thought was looking for a new $et of wheel$. But then I had this brainstorm. With nothing to lose I broke out some epoxy and a file to fix the gouges, hit them with a DA sander, primed them (spray bomb, nothing fancy) and hit them with this "kinda-krome-in-a-kan". No, they don't look like chrome...but they don't have to. They are a nice, bright, satin aluminum color that looks a lot brighter than just any old silver paint. It's been a few months and 4-5,000 miles and they still look good. Yes, the paint will leave a silver smudge on your fingers...but why are you feeling your wheels? Brake dust hasn't been a problem, somewhat to my surprise I can use a squirt bottle wheel cleaner and pressure washer with no issues. As many of you may have read, DO NOT clear coat this stuff!! If you do it will INSTANTLY turn to a nice, shiny...but durable!...battleship gray!! Another plus is that if you do mess it up it's easy to touch up again, dries in only a minute or two and blends easily, you can't tell where it's been touched up. So when I changed the rear tires last week (can't figure out how just the rears went bald so quickly) and was too cheap to pay a shop and I messed them up, it was only a few minutes with the sander, 10 minutes with the masking tape and they look great again...saved a whole bank busting $12 in shop fees! No, it's not "chrome"...but it ain't plain ol' silver paint either!I'll update this. It's been about 10 months, they now look like a silver gray, or maybe like polished aluminum that's been neglected. I also found that, though the one bottle of wheel cleaner I used worked fine in cleaning them with no issues, when it ran out I bought another bottle of something else and it tarnished and dulled wherever it hit so it makes a difference what wheel cleaners you use. I would use this paint again as a quick touch up as it is easy to put down and dries quick but there are other, far better ways to paint your wheels. Face it people, none of us are probably ever going to live to see actual chrome in a rattle can! I'll probably go with some Plastic Dip effect just to keep it simple.

I have five year old RV. The oxidation just started after last summer. I ordered product after reading reviews. It's the one I needed. Easy to you and perfect results. My best advice is small sections at a time. I did it by hand with great results. It goes a long way, just use many clean applicators.

Best wax I have ever used. Well worth the money.Has a beautiful smell.It goes on very easy (I use the Meguiars foam applicators) and buffs off even easier. It doesn't require a long dry time so you can do a panel or two at a time, and then move on.My truck is 3 years old, but the paint looked AMAZING after an application of this stuff. Look at the picture - it's ridiculous how good it looks.It goes on thin, so will last a good while.Do yourself and your vehicle a favor.

These are just okay. I thought I'd roll the dice despite some of the bad reviews and go ahead and buy them. First I should note, these are very thick and heavy - not stock looking at all. The adhesive doesn't seem as strong as it could be, either. One of the badges I got was damaged, I'll contact the seller about it. It's like something got underneath the paint and it's all messed up now. I'll post a picture.They're not great but they're just about as good as I could find for the price, so I'm fairly neutral about what I think about them. Better than nothing, but not great.

Frustration doesn't begin to cover the issue here. I can't seem to understand why in hell companies can't have a better quality control and just give a little bit more on quality. Rant over and my issue with the lights is the the driver side set fills with water. Purchased them more than 30 days before installing them and they are out of warranty. Received a bunch of YouTube video links as a solution to fixing them. I gave two stars cause the passenger side set are ok... not to deal with this issue...

I am a big fan of Husky liner products.. They are great. I have bought the floor mats for all of my new vehicles for the last 7 years. They really protect the carpet.I just bought a new 2011 F-150 FX2 and bought the Weatherbeater floor mats for it. I was so pleased with the look and protection I have now bought the splash guards for it. When they arrived I was impressed with them.... They are not some cheap flimsy plastic guard. They are a preformed hard plastic that matches the contour of the fender perfectly. They come in black but are paint-able to match your vehicle, which is what I did. My FX2 sport model F-150 has everything painted, bumpers, door handles, grill surround etc. So it was an easy decision to have these splash guards painted to match the truck...  And it looks really nice.As a note, I looked at and considered the OEM Ford splash guards but they were a soft rubber type and rubber will curl over time and I didn't want to deal with that down the road so I found these Husky liner guards to be a more permanent solution for long term use.

Mounting: These tires are listed as non-directional, but I think they are bi-directional, meaning that they have a tread direction that is different if mounted forwards versus backwards, but either tread pattern can be used. Non-directional can be either uniform (tread pattern is the same front or back) or bi-directional. It appears that there are two outer lugs slanted in one direction, then one smaller outer lug almost straight.  This pattern repeats with a lagging copy on the opposite side of the tire.  The big center lugs appear to slant in the same direction as the two outer lugs.  See photo.Based on several decades of off-roading, I am guessing this setup allows you to mount the Big Horns specifically for different conditions. If you have softer conditions, like mud, then the two outer lugs should slant towards the rear of the machine so the material is extruded out of the tire like a mud tire (which has lugs slanting out and to the rear).  If you ride in sand, the opposite direction would cause the sand to pack under the tire and provide some lift and less digging.  Rocks and hard surfaces probably don't care which way you mount them.  For snow  I am not sure which is better, but will try them different ways come winter.To get the tires mounted in the same direction, I put the white letters out on one side and black letters out on the other - while this is not the most aesthetically pleasing, I am interested more in the performance and do not want different tread patterns on opposite sides of the quad.  Besides, you can only view one side at a time, so there really is no beauty problem here.  And I can change the tread direction easily by swapping the tires from one side to the other - so if it turns out I need something different (say for snow or sand) its a quick fix.I have not ridden them enough to give a critical review, but here are a few first impressions:The ride is very smooth on the road.They are a bit heavy and I felt it in the start up and at crawl  speed, needing a little extra throttle then with my prior tires (mudlite XLs), but once rolling they had excellent stability and handling and throttle response was not an issue.They grab onto logs and roll up and over them better then any tire I have triedI ran through a muddy creek bed with no problem - felt as good as the mudlite XLs (which had great mud traction for an AT tread).I ran them down a gnarly rocky ravine and up some step rocky climbs and had no instability issues.They took some of the roughness out of the rocky trails compared to the prior tires.There isn't much mud here now, cause its hot/dry season, so will need to see how they do on off camber slippery slopes (later this year), which I have heard may be a problem.  Hope getting the mounting direction correct on both sides will alleviate that concern.Purchased these on Amazon from ATV outfitters and they arrived in a few days.  The tires have recent manufacturing dates on them, so they were brand new.Update 2/1/17:I really like these tires. These have no leaks after 7 months. It's nice not to be plugging and filling ATV tires constantly.  Rock traction is amazing - a real confidence builder over big rocks.  Very good in mud and snow.  No significant off camber sliding. Compared to a mud lite XL tire, these dig less so they are a little weaker on soft steep terrain. They seem to float over mud and snow.  The only notable issue is weight, but that is from 6 good plies - what makes them tuff.  My prior XL's had weak sidewalls and delaminated after 2000 miles over rocky trails. Definitely worth the money.

This makes my bike cleaning easy!! It removes dirts hiding in nook and cranny without getting my hands dirty. Just spray, leave it for a minute or two, then POWER wash it! Im so amazed how much dirty it removed when i looked at the dark rusty water it left behind.  I even used this to wash my 3 year old car engine, it left it sparkly clean. I took a photo of my car engine (before and after), my bike is new so i don't see much different but cleaning wheels are significant specially getting rid of brake dusts!

I installed this into my Hyundai Elantra 2008 by removing the cupholder.  If you have this car you can pry the cupholder out by using a flathead screwdriver.  I tore out the old ratty shift boot since it was stapled in.  Screwed in this one and popped the cupholders back in.  Make sure to reseat the reverse lockout.  Good quality product.

I am rating this Winch a 5 Star because it is a BEAST, and Does a WONDERFUL job. However there are several things that were not good and had to be overcome to get it to that point. This of course was annoying.The first issue was I got the Winch in and Mounted it to my 2500 Chevy Silverado Diesel. The Winch was SO big I had to make some modifications to the Winch Cradle I got from Tuff Stuff to make it fit the Curt 31042 Front trailer hitch.2nd after I did 5 pulls with the Winch it just completely quit and would never work again. Now I did do four of those five pulls back to back. However that should NOT have been enough to kill it, but it did. So I told Amazon and they promptly sent me a new one that arrived within 2 days, which was nice. No questions were asked. I have used the new one for 10 pulls and it is VERY strong and works Amazing!!3rd Alot of the fastener hardware is cheap Chinese screws that have the head strip out easily if you don't press it hard as an 800 lb. Gorilla can.I recommend replacing ALL fasteners with American made Stainless Steel equivalents.4th they sent the Wrong Mounting bracket so I could not Mount the Module on the left side of the unit like I had preferred to do. Going to call SmittyBilt and see if they will send me the correct bracket.5th So since the side mount Bracket did not have the correct fitment I had to use the center mount method. Well once installed the module, it would slide from side to side on the cross members. So I had to take it off and bend the Bracket so when mounted it would be tight and could not move.A hassle for sure but not that big of a deal.6th the second winch that came in had a remote that would randomly bump the line back out into Spool out mode. So While I would try to wind it up the line would just start coming back out. I corrected this by taking the first Winch'es Remote and sending back the second Winch'es remote with the defective Winch. The Winch has Not had that problem at all since trading out remotes.7th on both Units You have to bump the Remote in or out sometimes to get the clutch to engage or disengage. (Not to big of a deal just a little Quirky)8th Finally the Free Spool is a little difficult. I am 6'-4" and a pretty strong guy, However I have to really put the Muscle into it and really lean all my weight into pulling the line to get it off the drum.I know that was alot, but if you can get past these quirks as I did the Winch is actually quite Outstanding. The main thing is I think SmittyBilt REALLY needs to up their game on the Quality control department, as well as upgrading ALL fastener hardware.I have loaded vehicles onto trailers, pulled up stumps and destroyed a mobile home with this Winch. it is Very Stout.I will come back and give it a 6 month review when that time comes.IF this unit ends up dying in that time.... I will get it fixed, sell it, and buy the Most expensive Warn I can find.I hope it Will not come to that though..... and by all the other reviews I have seen.... I don't think it will.I say Give this Winch a try You Might end up liking it.

Great for topside oil changes on euro cars.

I bought a another siphon from a local autoparts store and i can say the mityvac out performs it.

Bought the 2" kit for a 2016 Sr5 4Runner.  Was hoping for a completely even level but sits 1/8" higher in the front now. Not really noticeable, looks almost perfectly level, but I'm anal about it. Yes I said anal. Ha ha ha.  However it does look great and more aggressive, a little more capable off road. Nothing too crazy, once it's paid off maybe I can afford a nice 3 inch toytek suspension lift.

We Just got back from a 4 day camping trip. When we arrived at our camp site the first thing I did was connect the power to the travel trailer via Camco 30 amp Power defender. The wife started the A/C and proceeded to unpack our stuff. She turned on every light in the trailer and the radio too! So with the Refrigerator on, all the lights on, the A/C on full blast and the radio on, It was just too much for our little travel trailer. The Power defender shut it all down without tripping the main breaker or any breakers or fuses in the panel. I shut off all lights and A/C and about 5 minutes later it reset and we had full power again! I think this thing saved our camping trip and did its job very well. We are very happy we got this and would recommended it from this experience.

This really worked great on my 91 Miata stock "daisy" alloy wheels. I left it on for about 15 seconds, then scrubbed with an old toothbrush and rinsed with my garden hose. I never left the stuff on for more than about 30 seconds, wasn't sure if it would eventually etch the aluminum. I was really amazed at the results. See the before and after pics. I didn't even spend much time on it.

I bought this as it said works with stainless up to 4". That couldn't be further from the truth. I was excited to receive this toolkit and I tried to use it on stainless 3-inch piping for my custom exhaust project. Pulling it out of the packaging everything seemed to be a quality material. I took it all apart lubricated all parts and went to town with my Ingersoll impact. I tried for about 10 minutes of on-and-off impacting to no avail. As you can see with the pipe below it is not expanded far enough to slip another pipe on.If you're looking to do some stainless piping 3 inches or above save your money and buy a hydraulic unit insteadEdit: also to note, good luck trying to keep your pipe from spinning when impacting. I tried this with a pipe in my bench vise and it basically bent the end of the pipe that was clamped in...Im sure this works perfectly for softer metal such as aluminum and steel pipe....stainless is too hard

Looks good. I was up on the fence about purchasing this for a car. I like the look they give pickup trucks but never really seen one on a Toyota Corolla. I purchased it mostly because I drive alot of freeway miles so figured it might help with rock chips to the hood and windshiled. Looks better then I expected. Solid product and fitment was great.

Great lights! I set them up as reverse lights on my Silverado and love them. Some people complain about the mounting hardware but it's not bad for a cheap set of lights. Due to moisture complaints from other reviewers, I went down to my Hardware store and picked up some G&E weatherproof black caulking to seal any possible gaps. Would definitely recommend, haven't had any issues.

Arrived quickly, installed easily and work well.  Very bright and look great. I give 4 stars instead of 5 only because, ofcourse, there is not enough wire extensions to easily reach throughout the bike.  Ofcourse they do this so you'll have to purchase more, but whatever.  I made it work.

I ordered these tail guards to give my Jeep a more "rugged" look. While it does make the Jeep look tougher, the materials used do not feel like it will protect my lights from any serious damage. I was thinking that I was getting a rolled metal, but instead I got pressed sheet metal. It looks good from far, but up close, you can tell these aren't the best quality. Also, part of the side was scuffed right out of the box. For the price, they are a good deal....just don't expect to do any off reading with these. I received this item at a discounted or free price, and as you can see, I left an honest and unbiased review.

This is the most amazing wheel and tire cleaner I have ever used. I used to have to use the old Westley's Bleche White for tires and something else for the rims. Especially after Black Magic ruined the tire Westleys formula I was desperate for a solution. In comes Brown Royal. Wow. I spray it on any type of wheel I have from replica aluminum with clear coat to high end 3 piece powdercoated/polished to stock aluminum and it just melts away the grime on the wheel and tire without harming a thing. I don't even use a brush or sponge anymore, just pressure wash it away. Highly recommended. Even if you go to car washes they never clean the wheels properly. Just buy this to finish what they started.

Installed on a 2001 Ford F150 SuperCrew, and they look great. I have tinted windows and no longer have to roll down my windows to see anymore. They work great and I hope they last a long time which I expect them too. They shine bright in the day light, which means they look great at night.

Nice cover! Problem is it fits the bike, but not so well if you have additions. wind deflectors, lighting around saddlebags...that sort of stuff that  every Goldwing I've owned or see around pretty much has installed. It does fit though just a bit snug. The 1 star short of five is because there is no reinforcements where the antennas fold. It only took a 5-7 mph breeze to press cover hard enough to puncture the cover at antenna bend, and I left ALL the room/slack possible. I cured that problem with tennis balls. But it should be reinforced, and it bit bigger for the accessories almost every winger installs. It does handle the weather, snow, rain quite well. I would buy again, but I got my 2 balls now to protect.

Perfect fit!  ... the bumper feels substantial and the holes fit the OEM holes in the frame of my 2004 GMC Sierra 2500HD perfectly.  The plastic trim did not come in perfect form ... one hole was missing the plastic anchor (this end of the corner was hanging unattached)  and could never have fit, the hole in the plastic) It did not come close to aligning to the hole in the bumper .  I used the anchor from the old bumper and drilled a new hole in the plastic to align with the pre drilled hole in the bumper. I also used all my original bolts which came out no problem with a big torque wrench  ... the originals just seemed more heavy duty than what was provided.  I sprayed all the old bolts and nuts with PB blaster one week in advance ... this is a New England truck that has seen a lot of salt.  Hoping for no rust in the near future!

I was a little apprehensive about taking a router to my truck but these fit the holes perfectly. They seem sturdy.  I cannot say if they rattle because between the turbos whistling, tires humming and music blaring - I can't hear jack.

I've been using the Arcan 3.5 ton floor jack for several years. I bought it in 2004 from Costco for $69. It died on me a couple of weeks ago so I got the  Arcan XL20 as a replacement.  Unlike others, mine was delivered without any damage at all.  The packaging wire clip was pretty easy to remove - just be careful.  I have a muscle car that sits relatively low and unlike my previous jack, the XL20 fits under the car perfectly.  At 18.1", it does not raise as high as the 3.5 ton Arcan. It does raise quickly, and with respect to its weight, others reviews state that the XL20 is heavy - well, I guess that's relative statement.... the XL20 is 67 lbs. - which is treat to move around as compared to my previous floor jack -- which is a heavy beast that weighs 107 lbs.  The XL20 is a nice floor jack that I would recommend to others.

Look at the pic to get an idea the size! Looks cool. Colors are vibrant and well made. Put it on my gun case and stuck perfectly with all the contoured ridges.For the prrson that gave it a bad review for not sticking hummmmm wonder what he used to clean it with cause im pretty sure that was the reason it didn't stick ! And then all he had to do was heat it up with a heat gun (which that is what i did to make all the ridges/nobbies come through) or hairdryer. Little patience and bam its not brain surgery

The fit was fine, but looking at this replacement next to the factory manifold, it became clear that the Pacesetter does not flow as well as the OEM one. Compare the pipes come off the flange and meet the collector at nearly 90 degrees vs. the original Nissan manifold where the pipes join the collector and a much more gradual and smooth angle.  I believe the sharp angles of the pacesetters along with using more harsh "joints" in the pipe instead of smooth flowing angles will create more turbulence and rob power.Had I noticed this when I was ordering or even before I installed them, I probably would have gone with the Dormans, which at the time were only a few dollars more than these.  (At the time of writing this, the Dormans have gone up in price to be about $40 more than these, but still probably worth it.)I do believe the overall design of the Pacesetters is better in that it has eliminated a couple of the flaws that I believe lead to the common cracking of the OEM manifold.  The cracking typically happens between the back 3rd and 4th pipe.  The design of the flange on the OEM manifold, where there's a gap in it allows the back pipe to flex more. Pair this with the extra stress that the 4th pipe and collector end see from the rest of the exhaust system "pulling" on it and you end up with cracks right at that point.  The Pacesetters have a solid flange and I believe eliminate some of this movement and stress.I've attached a picture showing the Pacesetter and stock manifolds next to each other.  The stock one is on the bottom.UPDATE:The text above is my original review.  Below is my follow up, just over two years later.  I originally gave this manifold 4 stars.  My update drops it to 1 (if I could give it negative stars I would).Imagine this:  A little less than two years after installing your Pacesetter 753505 Direct-Fit Manifold with Catalytic Converter, you start to hear what sounds like an exhaust leak coming from the driver's side of your engine bay.  It sucks, but manifolds crack and it's just something you have to fix occasionally.  It's a big job and you put it off until it gets closer to your next inspection since you know you'll have to take care of it before then. Fast forward another month or two. You're the tail end of a 5,000 mile road trip.  Only about a 1,000 miles to go until your home.  It seems like that ticking sound of your exhaust leak has gotten a tad louder, but you'll be home this afternoon and you can worry about it then.  Or you can worry about it when your Pacesetter 753505 Direct-Fit Manifold with Catalytic Converter BREAKS RIGHT HALF IN TWO WHILE YOUR DOING 80 MPH ON THE INTERSTATE.  That'll probably put a damper on your travel plans. I know it did on mine. After pulling over and limping to a safe place to assess the situation, I was shocked to find that the manifold had completely broken off at the collector pipe before the CAT.  I pondered the situation for a while.  I knew I had over 1,000 miles to get home and I knew I wasn't going to find a replacement, let alone the tools and place to install it in the middle of Arkansas.  So I managed to limp to the closest parts store and 4 hours, $25 worth of "mechanic's wire" and muffler wrap later, I was back on the road. Fortunately my repair lasted the trip and I had a replacement waiting for me when I got home.Sadly, I didn't realize how horribly the Pacesetter had failed and I had actually ordered the same as a replacement.  I was then faced with the decision of having my truck off the road for another week while I waited for a different replacement or just installing another junk pacesetter.  Knowing I'll be trading the truck within the next month or two I went with the later.Upon closer inspection after I removed the old manifold, I found cracks at just about every weld on every single one of the 4 individual pipes along with the massive failure at the main collector.I know what you're thinking:  "Why didn't you pursue the 3-year warranty on the original manifold?"  Great question!  I did consider going that route, but then I read the fine print in the warranty and learned a very key point in Pacesetter's warranty terms.  After 1 year their warranty is prorated based on the manufacturer's suggested retail price.  You'll be shocked to learn that the suggested retail price on them is $545.  That means they'll want you to pay approximately 2/3 of that price before they ship you a replacement.  Get your calculators out folks!  They want you to pay over $360 for a replacement manifold that costs $200 on most sites (and $170 on one common parts site!)  Yep, you're better off using that warranty to dry up the tears after the realization you bought the worst replacement manifolds possible for your Titan or Armada.Now, a few observations about the newest manifold I got to replace the cracked up pile of garbage:1) It now comes painted with some sort of coating.  I have no idea what this is and judging by how much smoke and burning happened when I get them hot, I'm going to say it's not a ceramic coating and probably not even a heat-resistant paint.  I have no clue why they would coat them as they are supposed to be stainless steal and shouldn't need any extra protection.  The manufacture date on these was 08/17 for the record.2) The weld around the output flange was perhaps the worst example of a finished weld I have ever seen.  There was actually a ~3/16" hole in the weld that goes all the way in to the pipe.  Seriously.  Once again, I had my truck torn down and the old, broken manifold removed before I noticed this.  I was left with the choice of leaving my truck incapacitated for another week or working with what I had.  I took my welder and did my best to plug the hole.  Not surprisingly it still looked better than Pacesetter's welds.3) There was a considerably amount of weld splatter inside all four of the individual tubes.  You could see evidence from where they made a half-assed attempt to knock them off with a bur or grinding stone, but it wasn't very effective.I've included pictures of the old manifold in all it's broken and cracked glory along with pictures of the replacement that is just as crappy.

I purchased this electrical hatch to replace the annoying, smaller, round hatch that came with the RV. This new hatch appears to be very well-made. The plastic is significant, not thin, and the "vermin" door works as advertised. My only complaint has to do with the thoroughness of the item description. 1) It does NOT come with mounting tape or screws. If you do not have these already, you can order the 04195 Large Hatch Installation Kit separately. 2) JR Products makes two variations of this unit - one with a thumb lock, and one with a key lock. The one here is the key lock version, and comes with a single key. The key # is CH751, which, in my case, opened the other hatches on my RV - a nice convenience. 3) The package also includes two decals that describe the electrical service in the hatch - one for 30 amp service, one for 50.

Very bright and easy to install. As an added bonus, reading the instructions on the back of the package had me rolling on the floor! I HAD to attach a picture of those instructions. Don't worry, the instructions are completely unessesary since attaching the mounting bracket is two simple screws that are fairly impossible to get wrong. Be sure to read those instructions, though! I'm not sure where the "halftone" is in my truck, or which part is actually the "haulm". Regardless, this is a great little light for very little price.

That means getting it mounted on my Jeep and taking it off-road and getting myself stuck.  However, I decided to start this review before that for 2 reasons.  First, not many people know about the Keeper name and second, I want to correct some statements that have been made in other reviews I've read.I'll start by giving a quick background of my use and knowledge of winches.  I go off-roading quite a bit in my Jeep with an off-road club.  Winches are a necessity and most of us have them on our rigs.  The people who have been doing this for a long time tend to rely on U.S. made winches by companies like Warn (the leader) and Superwinch.  Newer people like myself have begun looking for value and quality which we started seeing coming out of brands like Smittybilt and Rugged Ridge.  These winches are mostly made in the same plant in China and have proven to be mostly reliable with no real failure rate any higher than U.S. made ones.  These companies tend to select the manufacturer very carefully to avoid fiascos that other compnaies see when outsourcing the work.  Because of the success of these companies, others have followed so there has been a huge amount of new winches to choose from.  In general, they are all about the same so you have to select the features you want such as cable or synthetic rope, wired or wireless remote, line strength and length.  With such a huge universe to choose from now like Smitty, Rugged Ridge, Recon, Quadratec, etc..it is easy to find what you need.  What this has also done has created prices to fall sharply in the last 2 years.  $300 buys a very solid chinese made winch that can be reliable if cared for properly.  It has also forced companies like Warn to start producing cheaper winches in the $500 range to try and maintain the market share.The Keeper winch is priced like the U.S. made lower budget winch, however, it is made in China.  Others have stated that this is a great price for a 9500 pound winch with cable line.  Unfortunately, the current price at the time of this review puts it in the $500+ range which makes this the most expensive chinese made winch on the market.  You can easily get a chinese made winch with 10k pull strength with a synthetic line for less money than this one with a cable line.  I am not sure on how Keeper is trying to position themselves with pricing but they will be having a hard time competing unless this winch has a feature not found on others.  So far, I have not seen any feature that stands out.Included in the box is the winch itself, all of the mounting hardware, the fairlead, wires, one wired remote control and 2 wireless remotes.  I do like the fact that you get the wireless along with the wired but this feature is not unique to the Keeper.  Others offer this as well like Recon (I think its Recon).  But still, its a nice feature.  Others have stated that this comes with other accessories (if you read the description of the winch on Amazon it mentions them), however, this does NOT come with them.  Hopefully any reviewers that stated that it comes with all those accessories will edit their review as it is super misleading.  Those other accessories will add hundreds of dollars to the over cost if you went and bought them.The winch is heavy duty weighing in at around 90 pounds or so.  This will weight your front bumper down quite a bit but it is not unusual for a winch with a cable line.  The setup and look of it looks very familiar to the new Quadratech winches that hit the market earlier this year but with a different color pattern.  I am guessing, like others, this winch is made in the same factory as other brands.  That is actually a good thing if its true since they have been very reliable.I currently use a Smittybilt XRC10 Comp winch which has a synthetic line and a pull capacity of 10K.  I haven;t used a cable winch so I am a bit new to the differneces in spooling and maintenance.  Luckily, the cable comes already spooled on the winch (unlike my synth line with my Smitty) and most of the gus in my club run cable so I'm sure they will bring me up to speed.So that is it for now and I will update this in a few weeks as I know I will be using it quite a bit at my July club run which is at one of the hardest trails we run all year.  I will try and upload some pictures for others to see of the box and stuff that came with it.Update*** August 16, 2012***Just wanted to give an update on this winch.  Finally got it mounted and got to use it on my July wheeling trip in western MA.  I was a bit scared at first as we started seeing some smoke coming from the solenoid during a re-spool before we hit the trails.  During installation of the winch (very easy), the line came a bit loose so we wanted to make sure it was nice and tight in case we had to use it.  So during the re-spooling, smoke started to appear from the solenoid so we quickly stopped.  After asking some of our more "expert" off-road members, they suggested that it is most likely just factory burn off but we took some PB blaster and soaked down the cable.  That seemed to help so perhaps it was just the brand new line causing the issue...not really sure.On our second trail, at the first main obstacle we got to, a guy driving an older CJ thought it would be a good idea to try and go up the obstacle on the right side vs. the left side that everyone else was doing.  He ended up wedging himself in between a rock wall and a bolder and then destroyed his transfer case, rear driveshaft and front axle shaft.  Yup...winch time!!!.  so we hooked up the winch and successfully pulled him out of the wedge.  We saw no smoke at all even under a fairly heavy load.The winch itself is pretty fast.  Compared to my Smittybilt, it is probably a tiny bit slower but I'm OK with that since this one uses a cable rather than sythetic line.I do want to note a few more things about this winch and company.The connector on the winch was cracked (the plastic piece that is bolted onto the solenoid).  It worked but I was afraid that after a few times plugging in the remote, I would end up pulling it off completely.  So I contacted Keeper Winch to see what they can do for me.  The e-mail address in the winch manual did not work so I had to call the 800 line which got me someone in California at the parent company which apparently bought Keeper products a little while ago.  Keeper winch is located in CT (strange that CT seems to be home to a few winch companies like Superwinch!).  They transferred me to the CT office and I spoke to a very nice woman who tranferred me to one of their tech guys.  10 seconds on the phone and he said "yup, I'll send you a new one".  A few days later, the replacement part showed up at mey house.  So very good customer service!!Final item is on the wireless remote.  I do NOT like it.  It has a delay between hitting a button and the winch reacting to it.  This creates a small issue when spooling the line and trying to do small bits at a time.  If someone yells stop...I want it to stop and not keep pulling in for a few seconds.  So I prefer the corded winch line which acts more like other winches I've used.Oh, one more final things....the LED light built into the corded winch line is AWESOME!!!  Very bight and is useful around the Jeep when you need to check the undercarriage.I have some video of the winch in action.  I will try and upload it as soon as I can.I uploaded some video.  First part was re-spooling the line and the second part was winching out a guy who tried something stupid.

I've since upgraded to an Ultranger synthetic rope which has made the use of this winch 100x easier. This winch has been great. I've certainly put it to use. The wireless remote can be finicky some times but I just plug in the cable and it's response is immediate then.

This isn't close to what I would call a quality spray gun, but it is absolutely perfect for what I use it for. Doing heavy metal flake paint jobs on guitar builds. The fluid tip is massive so it has no problems spraying medium or even large flakes mixed in a reduced clear. I definitely wouldn't want to use an expensive gun for spraying flakes, so this is perfect for the job.

I ordered these grab bar handles to use in out UTV.We have a Polaris RZR and I thought these would make a nice addition to the sometimes wild rides we go on.I know these say they are for a Jeep, but these will fit any standard 2-3 inch roll bar.I know in our UTV we had to place them on the front part of the roll bar, because the roof interfered with the placement over the roll bar on the sides of our ride.Generous amount of nylon strap. I will have to cut the strap excess off in my application, and either burn the edges from fraying or do that and sewn the cut side of the velcro.Velcro is strong.Nice rubberized handle to grab onto for stabilization. Conforms nicely to my hand.The seller, in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, supplied me with this product complimentary.I rely on product reviews just like others to help make my purchase decisions so I try each product very carefully before reviewing and always do my best to leave honest opinions  and provide as much facts as possible based solely on my experience.

My son and I installed these in my 2017 Ford F150 in about 2 1/2 hours. Very nice heavy duty product. My truck is slightly higher in the front now but not enought to bother me. My truck also needed a front end alignment but thats because we removed the control arms to do it. I am very happy with this product and would buy it again.

These seem to be decent lights.  They are very heavy, probably cast 'metal' of some flavor. The fit and finish is mediocre.  The box on mine says "A-SLB-1C-10W-SPOT-WITHOUT LOGO".  As another reviewer has noted, the mounting screw that attaches the cast metal bracket is not very stout, so I immediately installed the bracket to the light with two-part epoxy, and used blue loctite on the screw threads, tightening with moderate torque. Hopefully these precautions will prevent any light/bracket loosening.  I did take one light apart and remove a plastic lens piece between the diode emitter and the front lens. Note that the lights have multiple silicone o-rings sealing the front ring and lens, so they should be weatherproof. I wouldn't submerge them as I'm unsure of the sealing done to the rear of the light where the cable comes into the housing.  I compared output with and without this refractor lens installed. The more focused output is as the lights came. Camera was locked at f/3.3, 1/13sec, ISO400. I plan to use these as daytime visibility lights for the front of my V-Strom. I think they'll be perfect for that. The output is definitely less than the 10w Cree XM-L emitter in my Fenix TK-41 flashlight. As long as they don't fall off or fail to illuminate, they'll work for me.EDIT: I ended up reinstalling the lens that I removed.  The viewing angle from ahead is much greater, the focused hot spot is much brighter, and the area out of the hot spot is on par with the brightness of the light without the lens.

Great winch if you never get it wet. Only on my bike for two rides before it stopped working. Pulled the cover off the motor and its full of water and big peices of debris. I don't even ride in deep water so there's no reason it should have that much water etc inside the motor. I contacted kfi about this and they would do nothing but try to charge me for a new motor fir their defective winch. You're better off getting a harbor freight winch.

Awesome portable power! It is on the heavy side but that's okay because the larger battery holds power for a long time. Thank you Schumacher for making a great product it does everything that describes and more. The only adjustment I would tell you is the recharge connector plug has the battery clamp in the way and needs to be moved in order to plug the extension cord into the charge unit to recharge it.This is the third battery pack I've owned and the best one so far. I have had that electromate 400 which would not take a new battery. I've also had the Wagan power dome NX and the battery capacity is way too small. This new Schumacher is amazing. Amazon had a great price and this is a great product I recommend it. Thanks for reading give me a thumbs up if you like it

I replaced the original equipment T5 lamps (number "11" in the attached image) with these LED bulbs. There were issues:The Good:- These LED bulbs are sold as a 10-pack;- The base is made of hard plastic;- Snug fit of LED; firm support of contacts; and, tight with within the instrument cluster circuit board--all important qualities that resist vibration.The Bad:- Some LEDs do not work- Assembly of this product IS required. The package contains two small bags: one contains the LEDs, the other, the bases ("sockets").- Neither base nor LED is marked with polarity.My advice: Shop around. While 10 T5 LEDs at this price seems attractive, caveat emptor (of course). It is likely not all 10 LEDs will work. And given this fact, there is little reassurance that those LEDs that 'do' work will continue 'to' work for their purported thousands of hours. Better, albeit more expensive, T5 products are available.If you do use this product, I recommend you test each LED for light prior to assembly; and then mark the polarity of each base 'before' installing. Don't skip either step.

Great quality decal, mine has been on the front fender of my motorcycle for over two years and has been through all kinds of weather conditions as I've traveled around the country. It has sparked many conversations in campgrounds and wilderness trails as well as parking lots and gas stations.

Great leds! Replaced a old led in my 1997 GMC Sierra dome light and I'm very happy with it. Very bright and clean pure white, not blueish looking. Highly recommend!

I bought theses for my limousine. I didn't want the tires to get eaten up by the sun but the other reason I bought them was because I didn't want a bunch of black tires marks on the car cover from the tire dressing. So far so good.

The light worked great for approximately 20 months then I realized one of the bulbs stopped working. I removed the bulb and found that the Left side was missing an LED bulb. Not sure if the cause was overheating or it was just a cheap soldering job, but I found it to be this way when I pulled it out.

If you looking for improvement on fog lights, these are not it. with that being said these are still good lights they re plug and play but not bright enough.

I used this product to paint the wheels on my e46 BMW 330Ci.My wheels are the M-Sport 17" and are really tricky to clean and paint. The wheels had bad paint, with paint peeling/peeled. The structure was OK, not too bad. Some curb rash.I bought 2 cans of the regular Black dip and two cans of the Bright Aluminum Metalizer against what everyone else was saying and what was recommended.I did 1x Light coat and 3x Full coats of Black. I still had some Black dip left. 15 minute downtime between coats. Then I proceeded to do the Metalizer which I did 1x Medium at the beginning and 2x Full coats. This was more than enough in my opinion and I still got more than 50% in 1 can left. The coverage of this product is absolutely amazing and is easy to put on unlike the black.If you want your wheels great again, this is a great and cheap way for them to look good without spending hundreds.

I am using these on 2015 Mazda 6 andI like the brightness.Installation is as easy as it can be. Plug and Play !Color is bit little too blue-ish white for for my taste but I knew that from ordering 6000K. Wish there was 4500 or 5000K option.I don't know if it because of color or the way light shines, it seems like it lays down lots of light on immediate foreground of the car rather than 20 ft away. But it overall it is brighter than my OEM bulbs, so I am happy for now. I will update in few weeks or months.Pics of before and after atached

I've been pleased with the brightness of these bulbs over stock. It definitely makes it easier to see at night. The stock are on the right in the photo. The pictures don't do the bulbs justice.

I just installed these today, and I thought it would be helpful to let everyone know how simple it is to apply these door edge films. First of all, these are actually 2 half inch strips. So it only covers .25 inches on each side of your door edge. One for each door, if you only have 2 doors.  This is actually adequate enough to provide the "edge" protection that you are looking for. The instructions are very clear, simply clean both the outside edge AND the inside edge of your door. Make sure your towel doesn't show any more dirt after the 20th wiping!! When you're absolutely sure the edge is clean, Clean your hands!! otherwise your fingers will make the adhesive dirty and you have failed......So be sure your hand is clean as well. This is a 3 move process, outside>edge>inside. Now, when applying the strip, start about 3 millimeters down from the top of the edge so you're not touching any of the trim. Then, eyeball your strip to be about half that you're applying to the outside edge. One hand will be guiding and eyeballing the strip and the other hand will be sliding to press the strip down. I found it easier to kinda slightly stretch the strip as I'm guiding it in place, and it works great for rounded corners too. Take your time on this, so it will look even. It will probably be longer than you need, I had to cut about 5 inches off. Then, you will press at the edge part only to seal it. Finally you will press the inside edge to seal it too (you don't have to be too picky on this part), and voila! you are done! Great product, it only shows a little bit, but does the job well. Good luck everyone!

2010 Honda Civic - I had a check engine light with a flashing "D" Drive light. I had the computer code read and it faulted P0847 - 3rd clutch transmission fluid pressure switch. The Honda dealer wanted $300+ to repair. After looking around on the Internet I decided to change the pressure switch myself. Turns out on this car it was extremely easy. The new switch arrived within two days so was very pleased with that and the switch included installation instructions. The directions were to access the switch from under the vehicle. The switch is right below the Transmission Fluid Level Dip Stick on the drivers side. I put the car on jack stands (must for safety folks!). It was accessible without removal of any splash shields. You will need a 22mm wrench to do the removal (or adjustable wrench). No problem in removal - it was on snug but not tight. Expect a little fluid loss when you take the switch out. Have the new one handy and install right away and that will minimize the amount; fluid loss isn't much. I hooked up electrical connector and the engine check light was extinguished out and flashing "D" Drive light was out. Remember to check fluid level per your car manual. I have been driving for 2 weeks now and no further issues. Cost was $36 which included one quart of Honda ATF.Picture 1 is removed switch... Picture 2 is new switch just installed... Picture 3 is new switch with electrical connector installed.

Came with labels already installed unlike those i  previous reviews.  I have Gearwrench ratcheting wrenches in this organizer, the larger ones fit with some side to side play left in the spaces.  The smaller sizes are a different story, almost too long and then almost too small as the smallest is sideways in the space.There are small "bumps" for the closed end of the wrench to use as a stop/balancing point.  Some could be a hair wider, with the amount of side to side play they may not stay in place with aggressive drawer operstion.The "size bar" isn't a feature that I will likely use.All together sturdy yet light weight.

Ok, so I just received and installed these and while installing , I was thinking to myself...Are these worth it? Well...as with anything for a Jeep..it it worth the price paid? I guess ..if it makes me happy, makes the Jeep look good...then it's worth it. They are made just like the fenders. Same material it seems. Complaints...well..it would be nice if the Allen nuts and bolts came already on but....they didn't so..If you own a Jeep..you already have your Hex or Star bits for the doors and you better have a metric set of sockets. 10 mm socket and an Allen key is all that is needed. A little time consuming but.....I will say that when I first took them out of the box..I thought...these are not worth what I paid....It's plastic with a bunch of nuts and bolts and 20 clips. Then I thought..well nothing is ever worth what we have to pay so let me see what this will look like. The clips that hold it to the factory fender...do hold very tight. I put one in the middle first and took a look and it looked great..so I put them all on and discovered...YES they are worth it..at least to me. They made the Jeep look great and added the finishing touch I wanted so ..yes they are pricey but ...I love the look.

I bought a 2004 4Runner, V6, 4WD with 135k miles.  The shocks were completely wasted.  I bought these and also some KYB front strut mounts.  I reused the original springs up front and used the 1.75" setting.  The results were a perfectly level vehicle.  Search for a video titled "Part 1 Toyota Tacoma Struts Install" on Youtube and you find the easiest way to do the front end.  About an hour per side with standard tools.The ride that I'm getting it great.  Really made it feel like a new 4Runner.  I'd highly recommend these.

I think so far so good...not a whole lot of distance, but it's not a $1000 Rigid bar either.  Painted mine silver to match my rack.  I also tightened up the the screws holding the lens on to the same tightness, with no leaks on the inside to date.  I don't think for the price it can be beat!

A little more then the knock off's but I'm ok with that. Went on pretty straight forward with my 01 TJ. Found it best to leave the bolts just barely tightened so it makes lining everything up easier. If you don't you will have to flex them into place but not by to much. I did not need any drilling and I can't say you should either. If it isn't lined up with the oem hole, go back and loosen things up and work with it. Dont vent out your jeep's tub more so then it is.

Well this will be rather short. I received my replacement today and it seems these are all relatively beat up. The replacement was a tad bit better but just really poor craftmanship, handling and quality control going on here. The welding looks like a child did it.Buyer beware. You will get your product buy it won't look new. I'm a bit worried that the construction is going to be out of wack and I won't be able to install this. Please refer to the pics and see for yourself. The hardware was even missing from the first one so this is definitely an upgrade despite how this one arrived.  I hope this helps.

Ok, first let's talk about what these are not. These are not going to turn night into day. These are also not top of the line, the- best-made-lights available. Got it? Good.These are less than $15. These are allegedly waterproof. These do throw some decent light. These are easy to install. These were also my first off-road light install. I've installed similar things (amps, stereos, etc) but never lights. It's really not difficult. Just a few things to be sure you do correctly. There are plenty of YouTube videos for learning. If you are only installing these lights you don't even need a relay assembly (just a switch). I'd recommend a relay but a good, quality switch can handle the amperage these draw without issue (I know because I also installed a similar set in the back and did not use a relay for them). I did use a relay for this setup because I knew I was going to also add a light bar to come on with these but for just these it isn't necessary.We'll see about longevity...if they crap out early, I'll amend my review.I installed these on my 3rd generation 4Runner with only minimal cutting away of plastic on the very lowest rung of my bumper assembly. My state requires a front license plate so I needed to work around that issue. These fit perfectly for this purpose! So far, so good.

I used these on my Hummer H3 shocks and they look great. These slide over the piston part of the shock to protect it from rock dings, mud and dirt. I've been using them for more than a year and they are holding up great. I take my H3 off road too. I slid one down to look at the rod and it is almost like new. I put them on all of my shocks. Great quality, good price.

Bought it to replace the long stock skyscraper antenna on my mustang. This one looks way better than the other one that made my car look like an RC Car! It bends slightly at high speed when its hot outside but goes straight again when you slow down. Reception is the same as the stock one. The only thing i don't like about it is the gap it leaves between the base and the end of the antenna, it's not much but would have preferred it to leave no gap. I added a couple of pics after i installed it.

When you need to get the job done, you need the right tools. For changing struts I used these and changed 4 of them within a pretty reasonable time. The compressor did the job and i'd recommend these specific strut compressors over the rentable ones from autozone or oreilly. Those are not anywhere as safe as these.I'd recommend using these with a 19mm air socket to speed up the process as tightening the 19mm bolts using a hand wrench adds some time to the spring changing process. With that said I used a 19mm hand sock tool and it still did the trick.Quality: The steel used in this spring compressor is really high and the finish on the compressor didn't come off during my usage, amazing quality really. When you get this and pick it up you can feel the quality, it's solid and heavy.

Everthing lined up perfectly.  It bolted right in without any persuasion Looks great on my 2012 JK.As others have said the finish is a bit on the thin side.. Also some of the welds are a bit rough.  I used some spot putty on the welds.  Then I spray painted it black again.  Then followed up with a coat of plastidip which was a mistake.One serious disappointment is that when I drive the vehicle at night with the fog lamps on they point way too low.  I had paid attention to the adjustment screws when swapping the lamps over.  I placed the screws pointing down so they would be accessible.  I thought no problem, I will just adjust them up.  Well no joy trying that. They hit along the top of the tube in which they mount and would not adjust upward.  Downward yes.  So basically my fog lamps are useless.  I suspect I could remove the bumper, enlarge the mounting holes so that lamps were more toward the bottom, but this seems like a lot of work at this time.------------------UpdateI was able to loosen the lamps mounting bolts without removing the bumper.  There was enough slop so that I could adjust the lamps up to their sweet spot.------------------Knowing what I now know I think I would advise loose fiting the fog lamps to the bumper, then adjust them all.the way up, screw clockwise, before tightening them down and mounting mounting the bumper.Other than that I am thinking this bumper is going to rock.  Can't wait to get a winch on it and hit the trailsUpdate May 2016. Got the winch installed.  This was difficult because on a smittybilt the bolts tighten from the bottom.  Very difficult and limited access to do so.  A simple change to the design would have made it easy

Again, wanted AC Delco parts and they are made in India. I included a picture, you can clearly see the tab is slightly longer so it would not fit in the caliper bracket. I have heard of this problem in the past but never came across it. I was way into the brake job not to stop, And the added expense to send these back did not make it feasible. I had to grind off a slight bit on the tops and the bottoms of each pad so that they would fit. If I buy and pay for OEM parts I should not have any trouble installing them.I installed them and "bedded them" in. Right now they seem to be stopping very well. Lets see what happens after some mileage goes on them.9/14/17 UPDATE: no issues or problems, truck stops very well.

The hose support ring has a very sharp edge and had already cut into the hose before i even took it out of the package. Only a matter of time before it slices the hose. If you just sanded down that edge (or they rounded it in the casting) then this wouldn't be an issue.Honestly, overall probably the best quality you'd find for the money, but not as good of quality as the vintage ones.

I cannot believe the price on this cover. I installed it in under 10 minutes, it fits tight as a drum, the vinyl feels like truly high quality material, the edge stitching is straight and nicely done. The cover fits perfectly on my 4th Generation, Ram 2500, Mega Cab.  The cover arrived in two days, in a box, and the cover is inside a nice, drawstring protective carrying bag for when you have the cover off the truck at some other time. If you need instructions to mount this to the truck... you're probably thinking too hard.  It was out of the box, out of the bag, and mounted on the truck in 7 or 8 minutes tops. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a soft tonneau bed cover.  Very Nicely done Tyger, well played.

Tried using it for the first time and it just jumped around on my garage floor. Did not fill the tire. Guage didn't even work. After trying a bunch of times I went to take out the adapter from my cigarette lighter input and it fell apart inside of it... the metal contacts and center point completely stuck inside my port with the plastic housing dangling on the cord. Going to try for the warranty claim, but this is obviously junk with little quality control.Edit* I ended up purchasing this one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L9WSTEG/ref=psdc_155346011_t3_B000SL4AA2  and I love it. I've used it tons of times since and it's fairly quick considering the power. It's used on our 3 vehicles with tires of 31PSI and 32PSI. LifeLine would never get back to me about the warranty. Literally threw that money down the drain I guess.

Item arrived in a timely fashion.  But bottom line, the lower right corner/edge was broken off.  As it was replacing a piece with a big rock star in the center of the lens, I really didn't notice the missing corner until after I installed it; really showed against the dark background.  Not sure what to make of it other than I probably would not buy from this seller again.  Then too, Amazon sellers often read reviews and they might replace this with a whole unbroken piece.  So for now, two stars.  Let's see what happens.

I am in the process of restoring my headlights using the sandpaper and elbow grease method. Spent about a hour on the right headlight using 3M wetordry 400, 600, 1000, 2000, 3000 trizact and 5000 trizact. After the oxidation and scratches were gone, I applied a few squirts of the Blue Magic sealer to a traditional wax applicator pad, smeared it onto the headlight and then buffed it with a microfiber towel. So far so good. I plan on applying every month or so (or as needed).

I love this product. It fits perfectly on my 2000 ej6. All the adjustment screws are there to adjust up and down and left to right. I'm not a big fan of the placement of where the adjustment screws are. It's a little difficult to make the up and down adjustment, but as long as you have a flexible ratchet wrench then you're in good shape. Looks good on my car and very clear that my lights are brighter and only little moister gets in on the drivers side only, but goes away quickly.

Looks nice on my truck. Aside from protecting the paint a bit, I don't know that I've really noticed any difference in bugs on the windshield or anything. A couple departures from the instructions that I took were first the little rubber bumpers they ask you to put on your hood. For one, the thing doesn't move enough to ever touch your hood in the first place unless it's physically struck by something of a big enough size that the thing would probably break anyway. So I attached those to the back side of the shield instead and that worked just fine because I didn't want them possibly marring my paint after a long time.  Second, the instructions want you to remove (on a 2015 Ram truck anyway) a rubber flange along the edge of your hood to install this. I actually removed it to start with, but didn't like the idea because it was obviously put there for a purpose, so I put it back on. I installed the shield over this flange and it works just fine with it still on there. The only difference is it makes it a bit more difficult to pull the hood release latch once the shield is installed, but you can still get to it (and I have chubby hands). Overall I'm pleased with the purchase, but the docking of one star is due to the unnecessary items in the instructions I mentioned.

I installed this on a Fjr 1300 2008, it was a perfect fit, I wired to the license plate running light. I did have to file a 1/16 inch off the bottom of my license plate, that was easy to do since they are aluminum , you calibrated with the bike sitting level and off of the kickstand. Unit flashes whenever you downshift or apply your brakes, A little pricey, but well worth it .

So I will update this review as soon as I install product.  It came wrapped nicely first in bubble wrap bag, and then again with foam, but upon pulling it from the packaging, did notice scratches on the lens that had to have come from factory since how it was wrapped.  Other than that, first impressions are good, wiring harness that was included appears to be of good quality and mounting hardware was included.  So far for the $30 I paid, I felt I got a good value.  Hopefully it will be bright once installed.

Excellent ! Just finishing the installation of this kit in my 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Installation took about 15 minutes, instructions were clear, it came with everything (with a service sticker also) I recommend this for all the WK owners that want fresh and clean air in their jeeps.

The price is unbeatable and the filter fits my '06 330xi perfectly. I replace it about once a year, before the service indicator goes off, but this year I had to replace it twice because there was so much road salt dust in the air that the service indicator came on a lot sooner than usual. The biggest tip I can offer is to make absolutely sure that you put the housing back in place perfectly, otherwise you'll have water leak into the cabin, through the blower motor, and into the carpet on the passenger's side... I know from experience.

Really like this cover!  I had put the one with black stitching on my Christmas 'wish list', and it magically showed up under the tree. :)  Gotta say, first impression was not good...when I opened the box, my heart sank a little, just because it was folded in half.  But as it turns out, that's not a problem at all...they even include a note explaining why (takes up less room on amazon's shelves).Anyway...my old Jeep Grand Cherokee's leather wrapped steering wheel was starting to peel and flake off here and there, so I had been looking for a quality cover, not some rubberized faux leather piece of junk.  And while this one was very modestly priced, the quality appears to be top-notch.  Within a few days after Christmas, I installed it on the Jeep.  I used a hair blow dryer on it (in the house) for probably 10 minutes or so, getting it nice and pliable...then trotted it out, lined it up the way I wanted it, and started putting it on--from the top.  I did have an extra set of hands (my son) that did help, but I think I could've gotten it on by myself.It's been about a month and a half now.  Yes, it made the already-fairly-thick steering wheel even thicker, but I really like the way it feels and looks.  It has just a bit of 'squeezability', but isn't sticky...nor is it slick-feeling, just a good balance, in my opinion.I included a picture I took that day that it was installed.  By the way, my wife paid full price for this...we are just regular-joe customers, not getting anything free or discounted.  But I would heartily recommend this cover if you're looking for something of good quality, but also very affordable.Good job, Rueesh....whoever you are. :)

Good light, the plastic visor warped causing the light to reflect of the windshield into the truck and the bracket screws loosen up causing the light to start rotating downwards. Other than that not bad. SUPER BRIGHT!

What a difference, already hitting temps in the 90s under this Texas sun and short little drives used to leave my back totally soaked in perspiration. Not anymore, these seat covers work far better than anything I've tried before. The beads I thought would be uncomfortable but to my surprise they are not.  They don't slip around either, the mesh backing grips to the seat surface when you sit. I actually noticed that you can feel the air circulate behind you (doors are off until November) results may be different in a closed car. Glad I made the decision to buy these. Also note, my 85 Jeep CJ7 is kinda a show piece so aesthetics were important in my decision- no complaints!!! The black look pretty good as well.Update: passenger comment; a friend jumped in and did a little ride with me. At first he was like, "you really get into the vintage thing", pointing at the beads. after about 3 minutes he was like, "wow, that's pretty cool, I can actually feel the air moving under me... I foots get some of these...."

So far these wires work just fine. I put them in at the same time as a set of NGK Iridium plugs on my new (to me) 06 Ford Ranger. Luckily for me I don't go and just yank the old wires off and go by the numbers on the new ones and I use a little sense and still change them one at a time which brings me to the reason I only gave 4 stars... Someone at NGK must think that my 4.0 v6 has six #5 cylinders.  I went to grab a wire, oh, that's #5, so I grabbed another... oh, that's #5, what the...  The whole box, all six wires, were marked as cylinder #5, so while I can say that these are indeed nice wires and feel like good quality wires I can't suggest you buy them for their cylinder identification feature.  The aren't the exact length of the stock Motorcrafts that they were replacing, but at least they were all consistently a couple inches longer than stock so there were no issues with short wires, and given how they do have a quality feel to them I don't expect I to have any issues with them in the coming years and feel that they will provide me with good, reliable service.

I got this CougarMotor LED Headlight Bulbs for my 2007 Sienna van which uses a 9006 type bulb.  The original halogen bulbs are dim and they just do not do justice to my aging eyes anymore.  So, I replaced them with the CougarMotor LED Headlight 9006 LED Bulbs.  The difference is almost like day and night (Note: I adjusted the LED beam a little lower then my original halogen beam so not to blind other on coming traffic) as this LED bulb puts lot of light on the road.  I can see street signs much further down the road much better at night for sure.This bulb is easy to install (less than 10 minutes, it is basically plug and play, the beam is nice and bright, and street signs light up at further distances and easier to see with these bulbs.  See the picture of the beams.

Note: If for some reason you think this review is not helpful, please specify that reason in comments. Be honest. I know it is long to read, but it is quite technical and thorough. If you do not like it for being too long, simply ignore it.Here is my experience with TS601.Generally, it does 4 functions for TPMS:1) Scan sensors2) Reprogram sensors3) Relearn cars computer with new sensor IDs (via OBDII)4) Read the sensor IDs from cars computer (via OBDII)Yes, it scans the sensors well. And it can reprogram the sensor ID numbers with whatever numbers you want, such as replicate (clone) the old ones, so the cars computer accepts new sensors as the original ones. However, if the old sensor is bad (does not respond) or lost (after removal), or the old sensors were mixed (say due to previous tire replacement or rotation) and were replaced with new ones that come with new ID numbers, then you need to relearn the cars computer with new sensor IDs.Here is the problem: the TS601 transposes the sensor IDs during relearn process, so the cars computer then reads the sensor IDs not in the order they were scanned. Refer to attached pictures.Here are the details.To relearn, I need to scan new sensors walking around the car in the following order: FL, FR, RR, RL (as prompted on TS601 display).The data was displayed as follows (in my case):FL 7A46852FR B4E1847RR A233852RL 1898850Then, I connected the tool to OBDII connector to write the sensor ID numbers into cars computer in order for latter to learn the new sensor IDs. After I pressed YES to confirm, the tool wrote the displayed sensor ID numbers to cars computer.Then, I red the sensor information from cars computer to verify if the relearn process was done correctly, and here is what was displayed:ID1 B4E1847ID2 A233852ID3 1898850ID4 7A46852Do you see that? Now, there are totally different attributes: ID1, ID2, ID3, ID4 instead of FL, FR, RR, RL. Compare these ID1, ID2, ID3, ID4 with the ones seen before (FL, FR, RR, RL) and note the difference. The sensor ID numbers are transposed. Now, a good question: what is the relationship between these attributes? Or more specifically: is FL the same as ID1 or ID4?Those who gave it 5 stars probably did not pay attention to this problem.Whether the TS601 writes the sensor ID numbers via OBDII incorrectly, or reads them incorrectly, the problem is that there are software bugs in TS601. And, it operates with 2 different sets of attributes (ID1, ID2, ID3, ID4) and (FL, FR, RR, RL), and there is no information about relationship between these sets in the Manual or anywhere else. The Autel customer service was unable to explain the matter. The numerous software updates did not lead to success. At the end, I returned TS601 to supplier.

Installed two, one each in new Honda EU2000i & EU2000i Companion generators. The Companion required a 12 VDC power supply harvested from a 120VAC to 12VDC PS because I did not want to tie into the LED status lights. The raw (PC board) PS was potted in 3M 270 to protect from the elements.  The EU 2000i tapped into existing 12VDC outlet. Both hour meters work. Since these devices are exposed to hash elements (vibration, gas etc) I'm holding one star back. You can already see the white lettering already start to desolve.

This is the best car polish I have used. It is not too expensive and it does the work. The last time I wax my car there was so much residue that I stayed away from waxing for many years. I love using this one. My car actually has a shine again. I have a 10-year-old honda that the paint is starting to fade. After using this product my car actually have a shine again. I am so happy and will buy more. I will be doing more polishing. This product is very easy to clean off. I used this polish for my headlights and rims too. It works great on them. Last time I use a headlight restore from Autozone and it messes up my lights. I am not able to clean off the chemical reaction that is stuck on my lights but the part that does not have the chemical reaction is clean with this product. the rims look great too with this product. I have a before and after photo attached to this review. I would buy this product again.

This was a great tool for getting at those hard to reach plug wires.  I preferred this tool over the Lisle 52990 pliers.  The finish of the tool is excellent and I did not have any problems with the handle separating under some pretty heavy use.  Still for the low price, this is a great value.  The end fits into tight spaces (if it doesn't fit, don't blame the tool, blame the engineers that designed the car) and easily fits under the lip of the wires.  I highly recommend.

I ordered the EEZ Tire Tire Pressure Monitoring System I received a open box containing 4 sensors a small bag of wires a suction mount a user guide and some foam the system was not functional due to no monitor being included in package, this is my 2nd attempt at product review due to policy, Your review should focus on specific features of the product and your experience with it. From what I can tell if it were supplied with a monitor it should preform as expected but without a monitor It has no chance at working correctly. The pieces I received did look nice

Installation was easy on our 2007 Chevy Tahoe. The hard part is removing the old emblem. Front emblem screwed right on after removing old emblem that I just broke off. It was held on by plastic pop off screw things(not technical, I know). New back emblem came with 3m adhesive strips that worked great. Old one was attached with similar adhesive. We just carefully pulled the old emblem off, scraped and cleaned the area, and  applied the new one. Make sure the area is clean and dry before attaching the new emblem.

Again, amazon has posted a product image which does not match with the actual product itself.  Not only that, amazon's parts fitment feature indicated that this part was NOT compatible with my vehicle.  I had to cross-reference with a couple of online auto parts sites to figure out that SB102 was compatible with the KYB 334450 and KYB 334451 struts for my vehicle.  Thank you reviewer Nguyen for posting a couple of pictures ofSB102 which helped in the purchasing decision of this product.I bought a couple of SB102 boot/bumper kits for the two front struts I was replacing on my vehicle.  The box comes with instructions for putting the boot and bumper together. The circular ridge on one of the ends of the white bumper fits into the circular groove on the inside of one of the end collars of the boot.  You might have to do a bit of pushing and squeezing.  If done properly, it makes the bumper end fit very snugly inside the boot end.  And then push the boot/bumper assembly on the damper shaft of the strut as per instructions.When the boot/bumper assembly first goes on the strut, it seems to be loose and can be easily slid up and down.  But after you mount the whole strut assembly back on the vehicle and lower the vehicle from the jack stands, the strut gets compressed and the boot/bumper assembly makes a very snug fit around the strut damper shaft.The rubber boot on the old strut which I pulled out from my vehicle was in very bad shape and was just falling apart in my hands.  This boot seems sturdier and hopefully lasts longer than a rubber boot.

I used this because of subwoofer rattle with my two 12" 500 RMS Kicker subs. I covered my rear deck, trunk lid, and the roof of my trunk with it. It seems to be great. It exceeded my expectations and cut out 100% of the rattle. I expected okay results, but this stuff has really gone far beyond that. I haven't had any issues with smell or melting... but right now it's fall in NC and extreme heat isn't really an issue, so I won't really know until summer.

Lived up to its hype on all the car detail sites. Used it via a Foam Cannon and sure enough - a little goes a LONG way so definitely pay attention to concentrate ratios!Only thing I didn't like was that car felt "tacky" after it was professionally dried off. Not sure of this was the Soap or what. Gonna try McKees next time so should be able to determine if it was this soap.Good product , a bit to overhyped but Chemical Guys has the resources to advertise as much as they do!

I was very skeptical of claying a vehicle after my last time trying to clay my Subaru Legacy with the turtle wax brand as it left marring paint, even AFTER I waxed it.  This clay bar kit will change the world!  I have a 2013 F150 FX4 that had rail dust ALL over my white exterior paint and was getting sick of seeing it.  I used an iron removal system first (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FX479WK?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00) to remove the larger particles then followed it up with the Chemical Guys clay bar kit.  Man does it make a difference.  Finished off the detail by using my Porter Cable Random Orbital Polisher paired with AutoGeek.net pads and truck looks better than when it rolled off the lot 2 years ago.  I cannot recommend this product more.

I actually paid for this-  can someone tell me how to get on the list of people who get free stuff to test?????- This packs a lot of power- I was surprised- in fact that might be its undoing- I had the battery clamps on for a few seconds, and the plastic part of one clamp melted!It comes with a warranty, but the warranty booklet has no contact information-The dealer refunded my payment and sent another one. I realized the issue is that the clamps are the weak spot- unless they really "bite" into your battery terminals, they get a "hot spot" and the plastic can melt.  If you do that right, they work as well as the old-fashioned large jumpers that used lead-acid car batteries.A charger of this size worked fine on my Harley when I took it out of storage and found the battery dead-so it would probably be adequate for a 4 cylinder compact car- I doubt this would start my 'vette. For that you need a larger, and more expensive one.These appear to all be made in China, and share a lot of parts- I would suggest one with a good size battery clamp.

Unless you're TRULY racing, in which case I'd recommend using the Motul 300V oil, this is the best you can get for your high performance street/sport bike!!  Awesome awesome oil!!!  Quiet's engine noise and provides nice smooth shifting.  And being it uses higher costing and superior ESTERS for it's base stocks over the cheaper base stocks that just about all other oil company uses in it's full synthetics...Mobil 1, Castrol, Royal Purple, Valvoline etc etc etc, means that I'm running the best stuff in my bike that money can buy!!!!!  I have absolutely ZERO complaints about Motul 7100, It's the best, HANDS DOWN!!!!!!

So far this is by far one of the best things I have purchased for my JKU. Went on easy, and fits perfect. Some people said they had to double up the bungees on the back. Just pull harder, it will stretch!  Did take a little finagling to get it to line up perfectly but it's not really that difficult.  A number of people have mentioned there are no instructions. You don't really need them. Just pull it tight and bungee where the grommets are. I installed it by looking at the photos on Amazon. It really is that easy. I live on the Great Plains/foothills of the Rockies where the sun, with a cloudless sky, can put a pretty good burn on you in just the matter of 30 minutes or so with moderate exposure..the UV blocking blocking properties of this shade is excellent. On the interstate it does flutter but it is very minimal. Edit: on second thought I think the flutter might be caused by my bug deflector as I notice my soft top is doing that now too.

Works great! I tinted my taillights with them and it turned out great and glossy! Here are tips to making it nice and glossy:1) Take 2000 grit sandpaper and a spray bottle with a few drops of dish soap and wet sand the outside of the taillights/headlights completely wet sanding the whole thing.2) Wipe off the lights with a microfiber towel then take rubbing alcohol and put some on another microfiber towel and clean the lights again and then let them air dry3) Spray on one light coat of Nite Shade and let it dry4) Repeat step 3 until desired tint (I did 3 coats which was kind of a medium/dark shade)5) After all the coats are applied and they dry completely take some Mcguiars Ultimate Compound and polish up the lights and make them have a glossy look6) Enjoy your glossy tinted lights!

(check out the before and after photos included)... Let me start by saying these will absolutely add a nice touch to an older car. I have a 2003 Cadillac Deville that I just had painted. After the paint job, there was basically no emblems, and the pillar Posts (which didn't get any paint) were scratched a bit and dull compared to the fresh paint job.These Pillar Post Trim Covers are nice and shiny. From 3 feet away or further, they accomplish the goal of covering my dull, scratched pillar posts with a nice "chrome" looking upgrade.When you look at them up close, the finish is excellent, BUT, the edges are rough. You can only notice it when looking from less than 3 feet away, and it is not horrible, but you will notice it. Others that are not looking for it may not notice unless they intentionally inspect it.Installation note: Once you peel the cover off of the sticky backing and start to apply it to the pillar post, if you get more than 1/8-1/4 inch "stuck", you can't go back and start over. If you try to remove it to start over, you will bend the cover and might even damage your car or finish.That said, make sure you read the instructions (they provide an Internet link to the instructions) and pre-fit to make sure you are putting them in the right spot and have already decided how you plan to place them. Don't over-think it... Just figure out where they go, peel the covering off the sticky backing, and carefully apply it to the pillar, starting with the top or the bottom edge and slowly laying it down as you watch the edges to make sure they are lining up correctly. Remember, there is NO backing up, so get it right the first time. Here are some before and after photos...Bottom line, this was a good purchase.

These Toyota Tacoma 2016 Tailgate Insert Piano Black Letters looked great on my Quicksand color 2016 Toyota Tacoma. I prefer these to the chrome because on my TRD Off Road Edition 4x4 Tacoma there is almost no chrome on the rear and plenty of black. It is a matter of taste but to me the black looked better. Really makes the truck look better! Very easy to install took 5 minutes and everyone said positive things!

This grill is perfect for filling in that hole in the front bumper of F150 trucks. My 2013 F150 was new off the lot with this hole that made it look like something was missing.This grill is made of solid metal. The front of the ribs are chrome, and the rest of it is coated in black giving it good corrosion protection. Its quality is far superior to the plastic hood grill that come standard on F150s.Because of its durability, I know it will fully protect my radiators from damage as rocks and debris fly towards the truck while on the road.Instructions:The printed instructions that come with this are terrible. But it is not hard to figure out how to mount it.Mounting:It has two tabs on the bottom that slide into the existing slots in the bumper. It also has two tabs on the top with holes that match up with the mounting tabs on the bumper. No holes need to be drilled in your bumper to get this grill mounted.It also comes with mounting hardware. I did not like their hardware, so I just used some washers, bolts, and lock-nuts I had in my garage. I felt this was more secure than using their setup. I posted a photo of how I did this. I did drill larger holes in this grill to get the right size bolts in it. However, the mounting tab holes on the truck bumper are large and did not need to be drilled.You have to secure this grill from the backside of your bumper. This is not an easy area to access if you have a fender mounted under your bumper. I accessed it from the top with the hood open. This is another reason I used my own hardware, because it was easier to bolt it on with wrenches than to try to hold a screwdriver.I am very satisfied with this product for its quality build and great looks. I posted a photo showing it mounted to my truck, but Amazon later ended up removing customer photos from all products.

I was looking for a light bar to go on the bumper of my FJ Cruiser, but just couldn't justify paying hundreds of dollars for the name brands.Spotted this one and figured why not.The differences I see from the more expensive ones is that you can't decide just to have the spot or flood on - it's all or nothing.And there is no switch included, just the wires coming out. So you have to get your own switch.Following the suggestion of others here, I immediately put some sealant around the area where the wires come into the unit to prevent leakage. And so far, even through some massive rain storms, not a drop of water has appeared inside.Definitely happy with this purchase.

UPDATE: Deducting a star, because this cheap code reader frequently OVERHEATS and then fails to sync, with no indication why.  If you leave this in a hot car, it will just suddenly and quietly stop working, and take hours before it cools off. Even if you keep it climate controlled, staying plugged in for 30 minutes or so will get it hot, and you're in trouble again.  Now that you know the problem, it's tolerable, but makes me wonder how many people who say this didn't work for them, might just have left it in a hot car too long...A code reader is a great item to have, even if you don't work on your car, just to avoid failing a smog test...  If your car hasn't been driven enough (since the battery was last disconnected) in exactly the RIGHT CONDITIONS to get all the sensors "ready", then you'll fail your smog check for no good reason, If you're in the city where you don't get it up to a steady 55MPH for minutes at a time, or you park outside where the vehicle is frequently over 120F degrees, then you need to be particularly concerned, as one failed test will cost more than the price of this tool.With a code reader, you can check the sensors are all READY and PASS before you go in, and never fail a smog check for such a stupid reason again. A mechanic will give you some general driving suggestions, but without an OBDII code reader and actual recommended "drive cycle" instructions to follow, you may end up wasting lots of time and fuel, and still never pass your smog test.The included manual is absolutely terrible, including the service code list.  You can figure out how to use it on your own, and search the web for service codes for your make of vehicle, but it's still a nuisance...  Some lists even tell you which components can cause the service code, and that can really help you find a common cause for multiple codes suddenly coming up. The included manual will barely tell you which major system might be causing the code.

They fit perfectly. They look 100% stock. They are, from my estimation, completely as advertised.Update on 06 September 2017: WELL...the rocker panel trim pieces have - rather suddenly - turned ashen gray. Not sure why or why so sudden. A bit peeved, to be honest. Be it the disappointing new gray color or perhaps the Natural Light in my hand, my rating is downgraded to 4 stars.

These universal mats were great for this 2013 Ford Expedition -  great color match to interior. little gripper nubs on the bottom to help ensure mats stay in place on vehicle carpet flooring- Mats are easily trimmed exact fit if needed-These fit fine in this Ford without trimming on either row- they could have been a little bigger in the front-  Much less expensive than Original Ford or after market mats of similar quality. High edges to ensure spills stay on the mats and not the vehicle floorboard.I highly recommend these mats as a great alternative to custom mats- these pictures do not show the true color very well. They are a true beige.I had the opportunity to review this product at a discounted cost for testing, inspecting and reviewing. I was not compensated for this review and this is my opinion based on my experience with this product. I hope you have found my review was helpful!

Item is exactly as described and worked perfectly. It fit the Norcold vent exactly like it should. I did use extra zip ties and put 3 on each one. Highly recommend to keep critters out. I have these screens on every vent on my 5th wheel.

Pure garbage. As others have mentioned, extremely cheap plastic and not made in America. The mold seam is right on the front, so even if you're lucky enough to have yours arrived unbroken, any trail use with brush will result in a split right down the center... however, most likely, your will arrived broken, so you won't have to worry about it.Of course, if it's not broken, as others have mentioned, the grill will fit into it terrible, oh, by the way, you have to assemble it. And, if you're like me, your grill will break too when assembling it... so this way at least the grill and hood will match. And.... if it doesn't break, it'll fit horribly and have huge gaps.A very nice way to say thanks after buying a $15,000 machine.

I had a mission: replace the 14 year old foam-backed headliner on my 1997 Nissan pickup.  It was ugly, drooping all over the place, and dirty like the face of a two year old.  The plan was to not go the way of foam-backed mistake again (for a truck I use as my home DIY stallion) but rather replace the cloth grime magnet with a more suitable, washable material - VINYL.  I needed the big guns for this and 3M Yellow Super Trim Adhesive holds that new vinyl headliner so well; it would rip the cardboard backer if I tried to pull it off!  Mission accomplished, headliner beautified, and another DIY mission accomplished.  I have added a picture of my final result using the 3M Yellow Super Trim Adhesive for your viewing pleasure!

3rd set of Husky Liners for as many vehicles.  I have had both Weather Tech and Westin.  I think the Husky fit the fronts better and hold better with the sharp nibs on the underside.  They are a little thinner than the Weather Techs I had but also more flexible.  I have the 40/20/40 split front seat so had to cut the pre-notched center piece out with a razor blade per instructions.  I also removed the back nibs from the 4 recess points that fit over the front seat plastic covers to prevent any possible scratching.  Got a great deal from Amazon Warehouse Deals.

These LED bulbs are well made but I don't find them to be super bright. I tested these with my Watts meter and it shows 1.2 watts 0.09mha with a 12.75 volts battery voltage. So these bulbs are not 5 watts.

I purchased two light bars from amazon this one(20inch) and one from a different brand(23inch) price difference was one dollar. This one was going on my brothers truck however will now be returned. There are several small blemishes on the bar, where it looks likes it was hit before painting. Speaking of the paint there are is lots of imperfections in the powder coating (looks like small clumps). However the biggest complaint about build quality is that the LED's are not centered in each reflector. This will cause uneven lighting.  Now this is a $28 and I must say it is a good deal for a $28, one might say these small things are just what happens when you buy cheap. However the 23inch light bar from a different seller didn't have these issues. Infact after closer inspection I couldn't find one mistake in the other light bar, and the cost different is only one US dollar ($29). So with this in mind I will be returning this one to get the other light bar for my brother.  I would give this light bar a 3.5 star. Not that it's bad just not as good as others.(I did not test light output however I wanted to return light bar without messing up the wires.)

Not understanding why anyone has an issue with these. There is an arrow on the back of each one so all you need to do is point it straight up and press in place. Mine fit perfectly with no gap. I did prep the area with alcohol to remove any wax so the tape would stick well. A great add on that didn't cost much. Love mine.

I had a horrible experience with this gas cap. The part of the cap that makes it vented fell out. When I stopped to fill up I found the piece sitting inside the neck of the tank. I was able to pull it out but some of the glue fell into the tank. I was hoping that it was a fluke so I purchased another one, after all I had the matching fuel gauge. The exact same thing happened. I repaired this one using some gasoline safe adhesive and it seems to be holding. Now the bike is in the shop to get the old "glue" taken out.I'll give it two stars because they do look good and are made from heavy chromed metal but I can't recommend this to others.2006 Road King FLHRC/I

I love this WDH. I was able to get level in no time flat. It works very well on my Titan XD and XLR 29HFS Toy Hauler. I'm using about 9-11 Lines on the bolt depending on the load. I get very and I mean very little sway when being passed by semi trucks. I bought the 8 inch drop but I could have used the 4 inch. One thing I recommend is getting a 1 1/8 ratchet wrench as once you get past the 9th thread you won't be able to use the included socket as it's not deep enough.

I installed the rear brake kit on my 2003 Toyota Sequoia. Installation took me about 2 hours. I guess I was slow because this was my first time installing a rear brake kit. Watching YouTube helped a lot. The whole kit fits well. Very satisfied. I followed the brake-in instructions. I will find out if this thing is as good or better than OEM. Drove my truck to work with no brake issues. Braking seems more improved. No steering wheel vibrations during sudden stop.

The product was a breeze to install and appears to match the daytime LEDs perfectly. It was just before dusk, so a night time comparison is soon. The install took maybe 5-10 minutes and fit perfectly. Push in slightly to get in the groove and locks into place just like the OEMs. Re-hook up the connectors and done. 2017 Honda Civic LX Sedan.It's a tight fit getting the bulb through the hole, so take your time in getting in the right position moving what you need to not gouge the bulb.Update: pics added

GREAT LED LIGHT...Very good quality led light. I have been looking for Led headlights & Fog lights for my 2010 Mercedes Benz ml350 W164 for long time.I'm glad I found these LED light I'm not looking any more. If anybody out there have 09, 10, & 11 Mercedes-Benz ML350 w164 you should definitely get these lights Plug & Play, most importantly you don't need any resistor or Canbus decoder, it doesn't show any error messages on board unlike all the other led lights have tried over the years. I ordered two sets H7 for my headlight and H11 for Fog lights both works fine without any any errors message.These led lights are very very Bright. I'll be posting pictures and YouTube video soon.I can't speak on the durability yet that's why I didn't give it 5 yet. I just bought them week ago. I'll do an UPDATE if it's necessary.Very very happy with this Led lights.

So I ordered my new classic tach from Amazon and it arrived the next day. But the glass was cracked and I was so disappointed cause I was all ready to install it in my 67 Buick GS 400.  And it was so well packed I could not believe the glass was broken. So I contacted Amazon within a half hour of receiving the broken tach and they responded right away and I received the new unbroken tach on Sunday via USPS. I tested the tach right away and it works fine. I am very happy with the tach and really, really happy with Amazon!  I added a photo to show how well it will fit once I get the console and other ancillary gauges back in place.  I did have to remove the chrome housing so make it fit but you would not see that anyway.Update on 9-29-2015:  just installed the tach into the console and it took hours to get it perfect but it fit and looks stock. New photo attached with better light.

NOV 29, 2014.OK looking RV cover but you can see through it and can see RV graphics behind once put on the RV... it is thin material has lots of holes and let rain water and lots of dust in and had to wash RV after taking off this cover a month later.... all in all, it did not seem to protect my RV and was a waste of money.03-02-2018 Update: Despite this ADCO 32841 RV cover being a piece of junk rv cover, very light weight, see through and dust/ dirt accommodation on roof of trailer , and since i have paid $270 for it, i still have used it and watched this ADCO 32841 RV cover rotton over last two years of intermittent use (cover was not used was in storage for over a year). This week, the ADCO 32841 RV cover gave up the ghost in it and split right in the middle of the cover top, front to back, in an area where there is stitching and joints.This confirms that this product is a total junk and should have listened to the reviews that gave it one star. I should not have bought it.My Opinion:-material does not hold to lightest of use.- poor workman stitching.- disposable like materials and not worth $270.- Other people reviews of ADCO  52xxx Designer Series SFS Aqua Shed covers (for example: ADCO 52205, and ADCO 32841 ) do agree that these covers are poorly made and are  total junk material.-ADCO should apologize and fully refund everyone that bought this product from them.My recommendation:DO NOT BUY. Please do read other reviews as well and you will find that although ADCO makes other great products that are solid, their rv covers failed big time.

Fits Great, in 2001 single cab Silverado. However, I purchased this item November 19, 2014. Somewhere around September of 2016, the plastic covering (where your elbow would rest most of the time during driving) has already worn out. It began cracking, and became very uncomfortable so i cut the entire plastic part off revealing a soft felt underneath. All in all I think its a good product with 1 major design flaw. (the cheap "pleather" plastic covering.) With as much wear as leaning on this with your arm/elbow as you naturally do, i'd say spend the extra money for one that is better material. If you are ok with this lasting 2 years then this is perfect for you.

Look and work great on my 2017 Toyota Tacoma TRD Sport. Took about 10 minutes to install with taking my time cleaning the window channel out. I did not sand the window channel with the included sanding pad, I just wiped them out with the alcohol pads. I left the windows up a couple days like the instructions said and I haven't had any problems. I scraped the AVS logo off with some WD-40 and my finger nail behind a paper towel.

These sliders are heavy duty and easy to install. They utilize the outriggers which connects the body to the frame. They do not attach to sheet metal at any point . The design is sound and quality is good. May change to a 5 star after I see how they take a punchAfter a year of use they have saved me ten times their cost in body damage. They are a must have !!!!

I absolutely adore this! Check your car for unusual spaces you could stick this into, whether the current cupholder, between the car seat and the hand brake, or on the door. The design is absolutely GENIUS, because both the top and bottom "round areas" are completely adjustable. One for placement of the cupholder, and the other to adjust the width of your cup. The bottom part can collapse to about 3.5-5 inches and the top is about the same or maybe a little more. Try to get a bottle with a wide bottom, and one that the dimensions are the same all the way up so it doesn't get top-heavy and fall out.As you can see I have my 40 ounce HydroFlask attached to my door, my door space is really narrow, only about 3.5 wide of space but it works perfectly, I love that I can grab it with my left hand and keep my dominant hand on the wheel since I'm usually cruising at high-speeds. Perfect, perfect, perfect. My search is finally over and I can finally stay well hydrated on the road. I would've paid $50 for this thing, it fits my needs perfectly! Five stars all the way!

I love this roof basket however I ended up returning it.  Modifications were made in mounting it on the load bars of an '08 MINI Cooper but I felt unsafe so I ended up returning it.  It is very comparable to big name brands for half the price and if I could only adjust my load bars because it was too close to one another. Other than that, great product and would recommend it to anyone.  Just make sure that your load bars are more that 27 inches apart for the basket to do a safe and secure install.

Low quality. The mirror part fall off. And there is no way that I can put it back. It fall off on the free way, under 78mph. (I believe I can fly~~). Btw I just install it one my bike one day ago. Arrived two days ago. Also this is the second one. The first one I bought, they send a wrong one. So I change a seller. Still not good.

I purchased Leather Cleaner & Conditioner by Kevian Clean to clean my car seats and keep them protected. I work at a car dealership and I see how leather can crack if you don't keep the leather cleaned and protected. I have used professional leather cleaners from work and this product works as good or better than those. I tried it on my leather purse and wallet that look clean but after putting on the leather cleaner the white cloth was dirty. The purse and the wallet looked new again.

May not be super bright in daylight but they can see still yes it makes the signals faster then normal but I like it that way.

Great to do business with. Good product description and fast shipping. However, if you're familiar with trickle chargers that's how small this is, which is a little difficult to pick up on from the photos so I've added a couple of my own, note the SHORT 24 INCH power cord!

Mounted these for use as rear work lights on our Kubota L3710 Tractor. Using existing wiring (formerly for 55 watt Halogen Spot (very narrow beam) lights) I attached these to locally procured "L" brackets on the ROPS (roll-over protection system). When using the snow blower attached to the 3 point hitch, these new flood patterned beams really spread light wide and away providing a new view (see attached photo's.

Useless! I honestly don't know what the point of a cover is if it isn't water resistant. Bought this to assist our starting to leak roof but the water went RIGHT through it and we didn't realize till months later when the electrical went haywire from getting soaked in a recent storm. Not the cover's fault for us having a bad roof, but seriously... is it just a dust cover? What's it supposed to be for??

Like everyone else who buys this product, I'm using it for occasional use to protect my car's leather seats from sweat and sunscreen.It's thick and rigid enough to stay put when in use and covers the seat completely. The underside is slightly tacky to help keep it in place and the top surface is smooth so you can easily slide in without wrinkling it. It's similar in construction to a neoprene drink cozy. It fits on in seconds and folds quickly and neatly into a manageable size.The fit is a little awkward at the top. There is some gaping that is improved by pulling it up so that there is extra fabric under the headrest (see picture). I hope this is a minor issue and doesn't cause folding or tears later on. I'm using it on a Honda Accord.

I'm a 63 year old woman. I installed this my myself on my 2015 Ram crew cab in minutes!  I didn't even find the directions until I was done. (they were in the storage bag).  I did go to a local auto parts store and get thicker weatherstrip for the front of the bed, just because that's how I do things.  I've had several roll up type tonneau covers before and the quality of this tri-fold seems as good as or better.  Time will tell.  There was a tear in the storage bag when it arrived from someone cutting a hole in the box to make a carry handle, but it's not a problem for me.  Will update once winter snow and yuck weather starts.

Exactly what I was looking for! (2017 Toyota Sienna XLE AWD) This liner covers the ENTIRE area of the rear AND allows for the seats to be folded down on top of it, WITHOUT NEEDING TO REMOVE THE LINER!  Perfect!  The quality of the liner is what you would expect for the price.  It is not thin or cheap. It has a quality feel and a bit of "heft" to it - but is still easy to manage to get in and out of the vehicle.  It arrived in a long, narrow, rectangular box and was rolled up inside.  I suggest taking out of the box and letting it sit out on a table or floor overnight; or on a deck\lawn in the sun for a few hours to get rid of the "curl" before installing.

Love the look this kit gave my 4Runner. This is how the badging should have come from the factory, looks a lot cleaner than chrome. Install was quick and easy. Theyve held up well for 3 months so far, even when using a pressure washer to clean it. A little expensive for a few pieces of plastic but the look is worth it.

While this order arrived amazingly fast and was nicely packaged, a nice electronics type mylar bag within a tidy little box, they are not as bright the old incandescent bulbs that I HAVE to replace. A white color rather than the amber color of old, but still hardly deserving of the 'BRIGHT" label.

Installed them to replace my daytime running lights on my Silverado.  Install was easy (it is a light bulb after all).  They were very bright and definitely much more noticeable than the original filament bulbs.  However, after only three days, I noticed some flickering coming from the lights.  I first noticed it on the reflection on the car in front of me, but was confirmed when I actually looked at them.  Not only were some of the LEDs flickering, some were even dead.  Checked the voltage on the harness, it's good to go.So I checked them on a calibrated bench top powersupply and even then, after being on a few minutes, did they start to flicker and some sections went out.  For those that are wondering, at 12VDC, they'll draw .42A.  Was hoping that a more expensive set of bulbs would be of better quality....--- UPDATE ----Upgrading to two stars, solely on customer service.  I was promptly refunded however was explained that I probably shouldn't use them as DRLs.  Well, then if your LEDs can't withstand being constantly on, then you should mention it in the description.  They did recommend a different higher lumen model for DRL.  Surprise, they're more expensive than these....

I installed this charger a few days ago and I'm loving it so far. Besides charging my car in 3 hours instead of 20, here is what I like best about this charger:1. This charger is beautifully designed. The charger looks nice, has a very visible status light so you know that it's connected to the internet, charging, etc. This thing looks good hanging on the wall, yet still has superior functionality compared to other chargers. Thought went into other design features like the charging cable: the leads that connect the charging cable to the charger are kept in order so that they cannot be incorrectly inserted, the body of the charger serves as a hanger for the charging cable, and mounting the unit to the wall is so simply and straightforward with all the needed tools included.2. Integration with the ChargePoint app. I already use the ChargePoint app to find charging stations in the area. This now shows up as an available charging station (only visible to you) in my app. Further, ALL of my charging history is in one place whether it be charging at home or on the go. The app shows how much you paid in charging on the go and the estimated cost of charging at home based on your utility rate plan.3. Easy to use. This charger was easy to unpack (beautiful packaging, by the way), easy to install, easy to set up and activate with the ChargePoint app, and is easy to plug in to charge the car and understand the charging status.This uses a NEMA 6-50 outlet (with a 40amp breaker) as opposed to the usual NEMA 14-50. This wasn't a big deal for me. The NEMA 6-50 outlet was $9 at HomeDepot and took about 3 minutes to swap out. Just don't forget to turn off the breaker first!Will update as I continue to use this charger!

Initial thoughts upon opening were that they felt thin and plastic like.  They held their shape for the most part being shoved into a box.Front liners fit fairly well.  I hope they relax and find their home after a few rides in the truck.  I am unsure if they are supposed to lay over the plastic door trim or tuck into it.  Passanger side along the center console you can see doesn't lay flat yet as well as under the dash.  The clips just rest inside of 2 pockets molded into the mats, they're not clipped or held by anything.Rear mat goes fits well too.  The only trouble spots are the edges that meet the door trim and next to the pillar.  Again I am hoping they find their home after a few rides.Install is straight forward.  Watch the teeth as you go though, they will get caught on your seats.  They need a bit of massaging to get into the right spot.

This bag does what it is intended to do.  Store a lot of stuff for your short trips.  However, don't expect it to be a long term solution.When we took our first road trip with our newborn, I expected my Wife to pack a lot.  I didn't expect her to pack everything from the house including the kitchen sink.  So despite the fact that we were just taking a 2 day road trip, I had to search for extra storage options.  One of the options I found was this bag.  It had rave reviews and was a great option considering the price.Despite many of the other reviews, I didn't think it was as good of a option as many have stated.  Don't get me wrong, you can put a lot into it.  However, every time you remove something or the cargo inside shifts, you have to refasten and tighten all the buckles.  Furthermore, the buckles take time to set up.  It isn't just a 3 minute deal.  To have it safely placed and tightened, it took me over 10 minutes each time.  The reason is because you have to buckle each strap pull on the strap, knot the strap so it doesn't loosen, and then tie another knot to ensure the excess isn't slapping around while you are driving down the freeway.  You have to repeat this process 8 times for each strap.Furthermore, as others have mentioned, it is almost a necessity to have some kind of pad under this bag unless you like having to get a paint job on your car after this trip.  I had an old carpet rug and used that as a barrier since I was cheap.  However, the rug moved ever so slightly and the bag went against the roof of my vehicle on one of the edges.  My roof now has a permanent hickie on it.  Learn from my mistake and just spend the extra bucks for a pad.I did experience rain during my trip and it held up okay.  Luckily, much of my cargo had some protection even if the rain seeped through.  Most of the condensation was near the zipper area.  This is not waterproof despite the label.  Even if it was waterproof, the very process of having to remove each buckle to get the cargo out would cause you to get rain inside.  The problem I encountered was that once water gets inside the bag, you would have to remove all the straps to be able to tilt the bag so all the water could drain out.  On part of the trip I had ice that froze inside the bag because I didn't have it fully drained .To sum it all up, this was a great bag in a pinch.  I think this bag is actually pretty good compared to other roof bags.  However, if you go on a lot of road trips, this is not the storage option for you.

seams to have worked great, turns all clean metal black, if any contaminants are on the metal it turns a brownish color instead.  Only time will tell if it really worked on my frame

Have had these for less then two months and I would be careful to buy them as I now consider these a fire hazard. 1 of the bulbs starting melting in the headlight housing.

Fit and finish is perfect on this cover. I have it on an 06 Ram 1500 long bed. Took a bit to install, but that was because I needed to cut the factory bedliner in order to attach the clips. I also took and used some of the leftover tailgate seal and added to the corners. Not sure if it is just my old truck, or if the corners on this are not set right, but needed an extra 2 layers of foam there to not have a visible gap.The only thing that I do not like about it is that I won't be covered under the warranty, since I purchased from Amazon warehouse deals, and since the original box was damaged, it was sold as an open box... might be something they need to mention in the listing.

At first these lights were awesome.  Took me a few day to get them installed. By 30 days after return date has passed. One of the light pods only has one led working. I cant return them.  They got moisture in them and killed the leds. They aren't waterproof.

This would easily be a 5 star product if the controller hadn't failed on me a year after I installed it but here I am writing a review 4.5 years later and still very happy with my purchase.  Why?  The LEDs are very visible on a hot summer day here in the desert sun, they are DOT approved, they are still weather tight, and by sheer luck the mounting brackets lined up perfectly with my 93 MR2's stock fog mounts that my car never came with.I got around the faulty controller by replacing it with a 12V relay wired to an ignition source through a switch in the cockpit.  Now I can control when they turn on/off once the car is running giving me the option to run them as fog lights as needed.  Just be warned though these LEDs are incredibly bright and at night compete with my 4300K HID projector retro fits (with the proper cut off).  I included a shot of how they look on the MR2.  While my camera phone does a poor job of capturing the visibility of the LEDs I can assure you that even under full sun and cloudless sky these are very visible and if you are like me and want just that much more visibility for all the distracted drivers we are plagued with daily these will definitely get the job done (that and some air horns under the hood).

No, this duster isn't for the car only, although it did a great job. Inside my car there always manages to be a light coating of dust all over the dash. What I usually end up doing is getting out the Windex and paper towels every now and then to keep it looking decent. My main reason for wanting the duster, however, was not for the car, but for the house. My house is one giant dust magnet and because we live next to a dirt lane.  Dust is a perpetual problem during the warmer months. Now that were heading into cooler weather, the furnace has kicked on and Im getting dust from the duct system.I do have a couple of the poofy, multicolored synthetic dusters, but the fibers tend to catch on things and they are difficult to keep clean.  Microfiber I do love, but they aren't as handy on smaller surfaces such a bookcases and knick knacks.  The duster does fit nicely in the car door, but Ill be keeping it in the house.  The duster, whicd is made of 100% wool from Australia and New Zealand, reminds me of an old-fashioned feather duster.  I haven't seen nor used one in years, but love this wool one.  The fibers are puffy, lightweight, and certainly lift that fine dust from surfaces.One of the main problems for many people, including me, is the fine dust that continually settles on the television and surrounding surfaces.  I can dust one day and its back the next.  Instead of having to haul out the cleaning supplies, I can lightly dust with this wool duster and leave the deeper cleaning for later.  I have one black TV stand / entertainment center that really shows dust.  The wool duster picked everything up nicely, leaving nothing behind.  That I like.The duster can be washed, but I haven't used it enough to get it really dirty.  I stepped outside and tapped it against the palm of my hand after I used it for a while. The dust began to fly and after I didn't see any more, I smoothed out the duster.  Its soft, totally efficient and just as good, if not better than the feather dusters.  It certainly beats out the synthetic by a mile and is as good as the microfiber, which I use for other surfaces.  The price point is decent, considering how well it works and the high-quality wool.  I wouldnt hesitate to recommend it, especially for those knick knacks, TVs, and shelving.Sample provided for review.

So far everything is great with this product. I applied it to a '17 WRX after performing a pretty lengthy prep of washing, iron decontaminating, claying, and a single stage machine polish. I did an alcohol wipe down on each panel after polishing it, and again prior to applying CQuartz to insure all dust or any residual oils/fillers were removed. The preparation is by far the most difficult and lengthy part of applying CQuartz. The actual application went very smoothly, and I did not experience any of the difficulties I sometimes see mentioned in reference to high spots or challenging removal.Post-application, dust and lint that settle onto the car do seem easier to lightly remove with a microfiber, but I can't comment on water behavior yet because I'm still within the 48 hour window and don't want to risk water spotting. Overall, the feeling of the paint is very slick and it does have a nice glossy/wet appearance. With the 30ml bottle I have approximately half of the bottle left, so I will probably apply a second coating.

I bought these mirrors after seeing this on reddit [...] and really liked the style.  Obviously they are not the best quality and will fall off if you do not secure them well.  I tried loctite but it didn't hold up in the wind at high speeds.  I ride a naked bike so there is a lot of wind pushing on the mirror.  Ended up using shoe goo to keep the mirror from moving and it works great.  I took my mirrors off because I split lanes a lot and get close to cars, now my bike is "legal" again.

I purchased these and received them relatively quick. When I went to install them, one of the wires came off one of the nozzles so I went onto Streetglow's website and contacted customer service. They sent me a whole new set completely free. I received the new set quickly as well. I recommend using superglue where the wires connect to the nozzle and bending them down along the bottom of the nozzle so they are secure and out of the way and don't get torn off while tightening the bolt. Also, make sure you use the black spacer with the notch in it for the wires cause that too helps with keeping the bolt from taring the wires off. I think these are illegal in most states cause they don't allow you to have emergency vehicle colored lights on your car (especially blue) so I wired them to my fog lights so I can turn them off at any time. They're so small though I don't think cops will bother with it unless they want to be a-holes. I've already seen these lights on a few cars before so I don't think it's a big deal. For the most part, it was a pretty easy install. The only difficulty I had was because the way my car was made. There's a metal welded covering across where the nozzles go underneath and a small cut out hole for the nozzles so there wasn't much room to put on the spacer and bolt and tighten everything. I ended up just cutting a little bit of the metal covering away so I had more room to get in there and install these thing. So the difficulty was on my cars part, other than that pretty easy install, and good customer service.*INSTRUCTIONS FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT*Remove old nozzles, Insert new nozzles(wire first).Slide spacer(flat side down) on followed by washer and nut.Tighten nut on both nozzles, then reconnect hoses to nozzles.Route wiring safely out of sight to the fog lights.Cut some of the rubber covering off wires on fog lights to expose wire.Wrap exposed wire from nozzles to exposed wire from fog lights.Positive(red) to Positive(red); Negative(black) to Negative(black).Positive might be different color (or black with a line), but Negative is always solid black.DON'T LET POSITIVE EXPOSED WIRE TOUCH NEGATIVE EXPOSED WIRE.Tape exposed wiring with electrical or duct tape. I prefer duct tape(holds better).

Bought this for a Predator 212. It screwed right into the airbox without a drill. and I coiled it around the spark plug 7 times so it would register. My wire was roughly 4 feet long. It works as it should. There is a battery on these things and only time will tell how long it lasts. The thing is sealed so either you will have to break it open to swap the battery or buy a new one. But if it were to not be sealed then it wouldnt be waterproof so nobody can really find one thats waterproof and not sealed. But overall I do recommend this product

These lights are awesome.  There is only only thing to make them better.  The adjustment screws need to have a hexagonal shape put on the end for adjustment of the lights at a later date.  Due to this I had to remove the them and take the old adjustment screws off the and put them on these new lights.

The Computer Warning Cancelers did exactly what they were made for; to stop the blinking or fluttering of my light upgrade then;  I realized you only need two for your entire vehicle..  Meaning one per side of your entire car, even with multiple High pressure, and LED bulbs at different locations....I will Explain: Heres what I noticed before, during and after my installation.I had minor fluttering with the surrounding LED's bulb s as well as the Xenon high pressure bulbs.. Each of the same sides as the 6000K lighting both front and rear driver and passenger sides had fluttering issues.  It looked ridiculous...This is where it got interesting.  I started with the passenger side first attaching the canceler to the left front Kensun HID Xenon 6000K Conversion Kit's ballast; which was located at the front passenger side running light.  After doing so I noticed all blinking activity stopped on the entire passenger side including the rear lighting, but the drivers side hadn't changed.  However as soon as finished installing the drivers side canceler all activity had completely stopped on the entire vehicle.I wanted to be sure of my findings before I posted a review so I waited and observed since first installing on May 31st to see if any sign of the problem returning; and to my relief it hasn't at all.  As a matter of fact I added side LED's and they've never blinked and that includes all the originals preforming perfectly since the install.I'm very impressed and happy with this product, and I can highly recommend these to anyone who's having fluttering/blinking issues.  You'll notice then all the new lighting will preform and look incredible like they were designed to do..Please post comments on my review to give updates on your experiences good or bad and if necessary I would assist if your running into a problems..Thanks...

Compact, easy to stow away when not in use.  Raised and lowered well.  Works well, but a tad wobbly. I was able to lift my my BMW K100 and do all of the drivetrain maintenance without any issues.  However, there is no flat surface on the bottom of the K100 engine, so certain bikes like this would require a bracket or base to support the engine on the stand.  Given that I had to remove the center stand, this lift was really helpful.

Fit like OEM 9140 bulbs. Plug and play, which is a bonus. These bulbs are not as bright as LEDs with drivers, or as bright as HIDs, and they aren't meant to be. They are about as bright as stock 9140s. That being said, they are BRIGHT enough. I don't think I would want anything brighter for fog lights. They do light up the road well. I got these to match the switchback LED turn signals I put in my truck (the switchbacks are crazy bright) and they are a nice touch. Took all of 10 seconds to swap each bulb. No ballast to mount, no wiring harness, no LED driver box or heat sinc to mess with. Im extremely happy with them. 5 stars all day long.

Smittybilt Carbine Bumper.  Excellent product, very high quality in the workmanship.  Shipping box and wrapping was well thought out and arrived completely intact. Install was straight forward. There were two main things I wanted to know before buying but could not find out: 1. Could I still mount the license plate without the fairlead/winch mount on there, YES!, in existing holes  2. Would it be easy to run wires through the bull bar and down through the bumper, NO!  Can it be done? Yes, there is a small hole on the bottom of the bull bar so one would have to drill a hole in the bumper where it mounts.  I believe this could be done but will explore other options first.  The fog lights mounted easily but the screws go into plastic inserts so they didn't get tight. If they don't hold it will be easy to secure with a nut and bolt.  I bought the harnesd extender as I didn't' really want to mess with extending the wires, although it would be easy to do with the bumper off.I'm glad I bought this and love the clean look it gave me.  Did not have to modify or fight with anything during the install. BY THE BOOK and no surprises on a 2015 JKU Sport.

It works. I have used it twice and both of times a pole has cracked or the tent has torn a little. I can't see it lasting more than 2 seasons. If you are going to be using this thing every weekend then I would invest in something a little better. But if you are only going to use it once or twice a season. It's for you!

So far: good quality, build and fit for a 2003 F-150 SuperCrew. Assembly bolted right into place and works well. There is a little more 'noise' from the blower than the old one. I'm not sure if this is a 'noisy' blower or if it's louder because it is blowing more than the one it replaced.  Time will tell, but so far so good.--edit 09/08/2014--After a few days the 'noisy' fan settled down and now is just as quiet as I remember the old OEM fan was. As such, I'm upping this to 5 stars.Still trying to figure out the 'gasket' that came with the fan. While it was the correct size the cutouts for screws didn't come anywhere close to matching the pattern of this fan. I didn't install the gasket anyways seeing as the OEM blower I pulled out didn't have one on it either.

Made using my drill jack combo much easier. Previously I used a 30mm socket but it kept slipping on the jack shaft. For my design of jack it is important to have the adapter aligned near perfect with the threaded shaft easy lots of vibration on the drill or impact wrench.

It came down to a choice between this Draw-Tite and the Curt. I wasn't about to fork over twice as much $$at the stealership. Liked the cleaner look of the Draw (had one on an F-250 years ago and it served me well,so I ordered this one. Install was a breeze ~ 40 min. Just had to drop the spare, everything lined up perfectly.You'll want an impact and I had to do the washer on a wire w/tape trick for one side, no biggie. Sucker looksand tows great. Just added a Smittybuilt 3/4" Shackle and already received comments on how "cherry" it is.I'd check and re-torque after a few hundred miles, just to be safe.

The item is okay, had a issue once received from seller was all nicked and  powder coat was chipping, told them I was very displeased, they refunded me the amount of the light due to damage was supprised they did. I just would Also like to say that if it will not line up with the 2 front windshield bolt holes you gotta push more due to the foam pad on the back of the mount, pad is too thick but other wise works

I tested this next to the Turtle Wax Ice Spray wax on my 2007 Camry Hybrid and found it to be as good but not better.  The only noticeable difference was the Turtle Wax Ice Spray Wax had more fragrance, and I personally liked the spray bottle better on the Ice.Both products were very easy to apply, and left no streaking or hazing even on glass, headlights, and mirrors.I even used both products inside on my bathroom mirrors and appliances like my refrigerator, and saw very similar results which were superior.  Both left a very smooth and fingerprint resistant finish.I cant comment on how long either product will last, since I tend to reapply after every 2 to 3 carwashes.Because the Turtle Wax Ice product line has several related products specifically  engimeered to work together, I have decided to stay with the Ice product line on my automobiles, and use the Chemical Guys spray wax  on household mirrors, windows, appliances, etc.The other main factor is  cost. You can get a bottle of the Turtle Wax Ice spray wax for less than $7.00.

The stereo went into the DIN housing easily. But the rectangle DIN filler(part name?) did not fit. Tried sliding it on from the back and front. Neither did the trick. Then i see why; it's about a quarter inch too small. The stereo itself isn't affected by the missing face plate, doesn't jiggle or move around at all. But as you can see from the picture it leaves a noticeable gap and leaves the stereo pushed in, instead of leveled with the kit.

IF you are going from a 2 to a 4 barrel, this adapter can be used. The problem is, the allen set bolts that are supplied to sit lower to clear the throttle butterflies are not suited to actually holding the bracket down. They fit inside the mounting holes which doesn't work. I got a 1" drill bit, and clamped the adapter to my drill press. I then set the depth to allow for 1/4" off the table. I drilled out where the adapter mounted to my intake on all 4 bolt holes. I then used normal bolts with a 7/8"ish wide washer that fit in the holes so I could use a much smaller gasket on top.I say 3 stars because it's not truly universal both ways. I will include pictures of my setup on here so you can kind of see what I did. Hope this helps.

The first time I bought this item, it arrived damaged.The second time I bought this item, again it arrived damaged.Interestingly, both items were DAMAGED in the same EXACT way. If you hold the tool with the blade facing up, the upper left corner was bent for both tools. To me, the damage seem to be a manufacturing defect affecting the whole production lot + poor quality control (the location of the damage was VERY obvious).I just bought the same item for the third time, hoping that third time is a charm. I hope I can finally receive a good/functional product.Pictures of the two damaged items from both purchases. Notice how there were no scratch marks on either tools. I haven't used any of them yet.

This stuff is great.  The spray bottle (comes full) and refill gallon are worth the price of admission as my father would say and you get the scrubber and four large microfiber towels.  The full spray bottle doesn't weigh too much.  It is comfortable to hang in my pocket without pulling down on my pants.  This stuff smells great too.I am a car wash guy and keep my three year old truck looking as good as I can but the last few months and this winter had it looking a bit filmy...Not nice.  I bought this stuff thinking I would use it regularly.  Put it in a bucket and left it in my basement.  Yeah I have been busy and didn't want to spend all that time (that I didn't have) cleaning and polishing.  Well.......This stuff is amazing.On Sunday Feb 19, I was 60 in New England and decided to try it out on my wife's brand new Jeep Cherokee.  I had just washed it and thought I would give it a shot.  I didn't pay the extra $6 for the hot wax.  Two towels and the spray bottle and went at it.  Ten minutes later it was done.  Windows and Wheels included.  I am talking FAST.  I wanted to do my truck but did have time to clean the heavy salt and dirt off it so it would have to wait.The wait didn't last long.  I was able to go to the car wash to clean 2 1/2 weeks of old man New England winter off my truck the next day.  When I got home, I grabbed my kit.  I keep my kit in a 5 gallon pail with the https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00023S8JA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=gyzyzygcom&linkId=3e6fec7b9abb5aad215622e7dab5f41c easy seat on top.  It keeps my kit together and nobody ever feels the need to steal a microfiber towel from it.  I started in on a crew cab 4x4 truck.  Yeah it was a little bit longer than 10 minutes but it is also 3 years old.  Started with the body and worked to the windows, then the front grille and bumpers.  Ooops almost forgot the door jams.  Got those clean too.  I then went at the chrome side steps and then ended with the wheels.  It took me about 30 minutes for a thorough cleaning.  The wheels took 10 minutes on their own (see photo).  I am impressed enough to come in and write this review.If you know what a 2013 F-150 Super Crew with the Chrome Package looks like....that is my truck.  It is almost new looking after using this stuff.  My son even said that it looks like the showroom.This is worth the purchase.  I will still wash my truck but will not pay extra for wax (like $6).  This kit was very inexpensive and will pay for itself in four washes.I received an email from the seller when I bought it with links to their videos on how to use their product and other products they sell.  I thought that was cool.  It also comes with a directions booklet in a ziploc bag.  I see a fathers day gift and birthday gifts in this kit....I paid full price and am not getting anything in return for my review.  I just love this kit.

I bought this to replace the shift boot in my 96 Ford Escort. The original boot was a rubber stepped shift boot, it's ugly as it is, but mine was ripping and falling apart. So for $5 I figured why not replace it.My first complaint with this boot was that it has a strong chemical smell out of the package, I left it outside for a hour or two before I actually put it in my car so the smell went away, luckily i don't smell it at all anymore.It has a nice feel to it and seems pretty durable for only $5. Not extremely a fan of the chrome piece at the top, but you can hardly even see it with the shift knob being kind large on my Escort. The stitching on it looks nice as well.The thing that did kind of bug me is that on one of the ends the stitching was kind of falling apart, luckily this was hidden away when I installed it so you can't see it at all.It took a little bit of customizing to be able to get it in my particular car right but I was eventually able to get it on and it looks like professional. I won't hold a grudge against it for this considering it's not marketing directly for my make and model, so that's understandable.All in all this is a very nice and professional looking boot for an amazing price as well, if you're looking for something nicer than your OEM boot this may be the option for you.

Went on my 1997 jeep cherokee sport, 4.0L 4x4.The product came fast, faster then expected. Shipping boxes were intact. Springs fit right in as if they were OEM. The hardest part was getting the old ones out. They really are 1in over stock height. They do look like they will last for a very long time. And the price is incredible. Best price out there, don't even try looking anywhere else and just order these. I was able to reuse my old u-bolts, but I Would recommend getting new ones just incase. This job took me bout 4 hours, I'm not a mechanic but I have some skills working on vehicles and I had air tools to do the job, if you don't have all proper tools it will take you longer

Have had these for a few months now.  Feel heavy and well built in your hand.  Holds up to water real well, they have been pressure washed quite a few times with no condensation in the lens yet.  Only thing keeping them from 5 stars is the hardware nuts and bolts have started to rust - no big deal.  Bright, and a exceptional value for the $.

To say corrosion resistant is a stretch. As a matter of fact, down-right untrue!! TheseSmittyBilt T0654FJ N-Fab Black Nerf Steps are rusting out and are corroded, opposite of how they are advertised (see the attached photographs). I'm not talking a little rust, they are totally eating away!!! To say I'm very disappointed in them would be an understatement. They're horrible, NEVER AGAIN!!!

These fit my 9005 socket in my car perfectly, very easy installation. These are very nice for my DRL's when you turn on the actual high beam the lighting is powerful but they will stay on as your regular headlights go on too. So it adds a hint of blue to your lighting, I will not be using for high beams because its illegal in my area but for DRL's they will be fine! Love the look on my car!

Excellent value for the money. It's not gonna be like those OEM products but it sure does the same job and look nice as well. The smell is typical for all the rubber mats. I did leave it out for a week and let it sit in the sun for couple hours to get rid of the kinks. I still smell like rubber but it's not that bad at all. I bought this for my 2017 CR-V which its cargo tray will only be used when the cargo cover is set in the lower position. I like my cargo area to stay flat at the higher position so that leave me no choice but to buy this trim-to-fit cargo mat. Thaks to all the reviews, I decided to buy this one and I am very happy with the result. If you are looking for one of these, there is no need to look any further! Buy this one and you will be done with sleepless hours of browsing.

It's a bummer to put the car away for the winter but it's great knowing that the car is as protected as it can be.Installation tips - - Having a second set of hands helps but probably not necessary. Also, good idea to do this on a warmer day. The capsule is plastic and cold makes it harder to move.In terms of the purchase decision - I didn't want a car cover sitting on the paint for months, and a car cover doesn't stop the occasional rodent from nibbling on the wires or getting into the interior and making a mess of the seats. Also keeps spiders from webbing everything, etc.  For the extra few dollars, very worth it for the car to come out as it went in.Note regarding moisture - I read what the manufacturer says about moisture and the fan, and it seems they are correct. It was snowing the day I put the car away and snow got on the car while I was jockeying onto the car capsule. Between that and the heat off the engine, the car fogged the bubble initially, but the moisture dispelled relatively quickly. You can see the moisture in the attached picture.Both the moisture and many of the wrinkles were gone the following day. Car including the vinyl top looks completely dry.

These LEDs are a great replacement for the stock incandescent bulbs.  I wanted a all-in-one kit for my 2004 Toyota Sienna because I didn't want to have to mess with picking out the individual size of bulbs (and there are 3 different sizes in your Sienna) and this package was exactly what I needed!  They are brighter and whiter than the standard bulbs.  Unfortunately the instructions leave almost everything to be desired and they only give you a hint that they have a polarity and if they don't work one way then try them the other way.  I have written up a detailed step-by-step tutorial on how to install these into your Toyota Sienna at ShareYourRepair.com simply search for "Sienna LED" to find the page.

This cover fits my 2017 6.4ft bed Dodge Ram 1500 Big Horn amazing!  After scratching my head and flipping the side rails back in forth for 20 minutes, I found the instructions...  I am attaching them as well just incase you did receive them.  Using the instructions, I had this cover installed in less then 10 minutes.  Tyger needs to have their instructions on their website and maybe a quick installation video. This cover is very well built better then any cover I have ever had and spent $500 + on it .  If you need a cover buy this one

Agree with other reviewers that it is OK  but could use some improvements. I'm using the landscape rake on Polaris Ranger to drag out a small horse arena. It does the job but does not lift them very high for transport in to and from work areas with out making major adjustments which I don't really need to do most times.  Also there is no additional down force to help it "bite in" if the footing is overly compacted.  I would love a remote actuator addition.  The alternative lift offered by Impacts was just too pricy.  All-in-all I get by and it does the job. I may try and kludge an actuator and additional down pressure system in the future so I don't have to climb in and out of the vehicle.OK - better than a year down the road and have used this a lot and bought additional implements.  Bolts and old weight set solved any down pressure issues.  I found an electrical linear 7 1/4" linear actuator at Northern Tool and momentary switch.  It wasn't a direct fit and required a moderate amount of 'fabrication' to adapt the unit to the lift. I'm sure this is not recommended by the manufacturer and is 'at your own risk'. I had to extend the 2" hitch attachment due to height interference with the bed of my Ranger.  It is a little slow but handles the load and sure beats getting in and out of the Ranger every time I need to raise and lower the attachments.  Photo shows the setup with blade attachment.Update: The lower mounting bracket broke within a year of modest use. It appears to be made of cast aluminum. This may have had a flaw in manufacture or just a weak design considering it is said to handle 600lb loads. Clearly not in a shock or shear case which is where I suspect they failure occurred. So, yeah, it works in casual low stress applications and certainly is cheaper than a hydraulic system for the ATV even with having to buy a replacement. I wouldn't worry about a small dump cart application as is often shown.

I have tried many tail light films, and this is one of the best. It's thin, malleable, and goes along curves great. The color is a perfect light smoke and is barely noticeable when the brakes are applied. As with any film though, there will be bubbles over letters and it can be difficult on corners, so if you want to apply it to a very curved surface, I would recommend Plasti-Dip Smoke instead.

I purchased 20 of these to replace the incandescents in my travel trailer. At $2.33 each, they're a bargain, particularly when compared to what the RV suppliers charge for them (roughly $10 apiece, IIRC). Every single one of them worked 100% as advertised. They are roughly the same brightness as the OEM bulbs they replaced, the color hue is so close to the incandesents as to be indistinguishable unless compared side by side, radiate virtually no heat, and use approximately 10% of the energy.To those that don't know, LED bulbs aren't polarity-agnostic. In other words, if you install them backwards they won't light up. If you install the bulb and it doesn't work, just pull it out & rotate 180 degrees. All should be fine.There are a few reviews that mention some of the wires are too short to make contact. Not the case for me, and I have to wonder if the issue wasn't the aforementioned polarity problem.I have included a picture showing the new LED bulb adjacent to the OEM incandescent. The LED is on the left. Obviously there is a difference in color scale, but like I said, it's only noticeable when viewed side by side. Once they're all swapped out you'd never see a difference. Skin tones and everything else look perfectly natural. Oh, that greenish cast in the picture is probably a white balance issue with my picture. Doesn't look that way to the naked eye.When it's all said and done,Official Seal of Approval applied

For $100, this this is awesome and extremely easy to install.  Just some plastic clips, and remove old one, put the new one in place, press into the slots (new metal clips provided) and reuse your top black plastic mounting clips.  Less than 20 mins to install!

I'm super impressed with these bags! They are super thick and strong and the perfect size for the Drive Car Garbage Can.We used these bags and the Drive Car Garbage can on a recent road trip with well over 15 hours in the car. The bags held up great and never leaked. They stay in place on the Drive Car Garbage Can, and we were super impressed with the whole product. I would definitely recommend both these liners and the garbage can!I received this product for testing purposes and was asked for my honest review to help potential buyers. I have no affiliation with the company, did not receive compensation, and all opinions come from my own experience with the product.

This blade did not squeegee the water very well, more than 2 passes,it didn't make any difference with the diff types of wax on my car,boat or truck,The boat has alot of sq area and its a big deal when it take longer to dry,most of it is pretty flat and 39ft long panels. when I made a pass it would leave a streak like a wet towel would do, making it look like dried morning dew on it,I would have to go back over with a absorber and towel  It also doesn't float

Absolute junk! Purchased for a 2010 G6, they were very hard to get snapped in the opening, one of them came apart (they're a two piece design) and would have to be glued back to be used, fortunately I only needed one. After I finally got one installed it sprays one round stream on the very bottom of the windshield. Lesson learned, these will go in the trash and I will buy OEM. I have no idea how these can have a good rating, they're junk!

I ordered these to go in my camper. When camping off the grid we rely on propane to cook with, heat our water, and cool the refrigerator. For lighting, all the power comes from a 12 volt battery.  After camping for several days, the battery tends to get week if we use our lights much. There are a total of 10 bulbs for indoor and outdoor lighting. All the bulbs are a standard 1156 automotive bulb. They tend to get pretty hot. When you have no AC you really don't need any extra heat. The bulbs came well packaged to protect them during shipment. The bulbs came to me in perfect condition. The bulbs have a total of 10 LEDs. Eight of them are around the outer surface of the bulb and two are on the end. This ensures that there is equal lighting in all the directions that a typical incandescent bulb would emit. One of the things I like about these bulbs is all of the LEDs are protected with a clear glass cover. The end of the bulb has two LEDs in it and there is a magnifying lens over them. The bulbs are really easy and quick to replace. Simply turn counter clockwise, and unlatch the pins of the old bulb and put the new one back in the same way. These bulbs are so much brighter than the incandescent bulbs, which tend to be a bit yellow looking. The Yorkim LED puts off a brilliant white light. I was actually surprised just how bright these bulbs really are. The inside of my camper is so much brighter than with the old bulbs. Three of the fixtures inside the camper have two bulbs to give us extra light when we need it. With these bulbs, we don't really need to turn on the second light. I cant think of a single thing that I don't like about this bulb. It is super bright white and really easy to replace. As a quick bit of information, these bulbs are a bit longer than the standard 1156 incandescent bulb. As can be seen by the picture I have uploaded, the LED bulb is about 3/8 longer than the incandescent bulb. Just make sure you have the clearance in your fixture for the extra length. Mine were a bit tight but I was still able to get them in without a problem. I received these bulbs at a discount for my unbiased testing and review. I would highly recommend these for other folks who have campers.

Just got today and installed. Took about an hour or so.  2016 ram crew cab. New bracket on 2016 front driver side for this model year. Aluminum looked like mild scratches underneath but consistent with what you would expect for aluminum material. My last side steps were 4" on 2014 ram. Only time will tell, but I think I will like the wider step with more surface area better, as will the kids and wife.

- As described. All the hype about these being better than cheap knock-offs is correct. I have cheap LED T10's and now I have these. Completely different in construction and brightness.Used them for side marker lights in a 74 Charger.(red rears, amber fronts) Almost too bright but does get everyone's attention. Will be looking for more bulbs for other applications in all my vehicles from this seller.In this case you do get what you pay for. Pay a little more, get a lot more.

I am very pleased with this set of 2 grab bar handles. I installed them in my 2-door 2009 Jeep Wrangler JK. They took under 30 seconds to install. They're very nice when I'm riding around with the doors off for use as an "arm rest", something to hold on to since I don't have a window sill or anything to rest my arm on with the doors off. They're very helpful for getting in and out of the Jeep. My Wrangler isn't lifted (yet) but it sits on 33's so it's a step up to get in for me, as I'm only 5'2". These handles are the perfect simple addition to the wrangler. They hold my weight with no issues at all. You can see in the pictures I attached below how the handles look when installed.They are a very solid material with strong, thick velcro on each of the three straps. I'm not worried at all about these tearing or coming off. I also like that the back piece that goes around the actual roll-bar it's self is very wide: this will prevent damage to the roll bar over time. I was able to ratchet these down very tight so they don't move or slide when yanked on. This is a sturdy grab bar handle and a great value for the price. I plan to order another set of two for the back seats. We off road on the weekends and grab bar handles really are a necessity to keep passengers in their seats. ;)I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

My Subaru outback's center console has a pretty hard thinly cushioned top to it that can become uncomfortable on long trips. I would sometimes put a pillow under my elbow but it was a pain at times especially since it has been cracked in the past.I found this pillow and have owned it for 6 months now. It has held up very well and I can't see doing with out it. It has nice cushioning and is held in place well with the straps that wrap around the arm rest. It doesn't change the open close function of the arm rest.I would definitely buy again and probably will for a future vehicle.People that ride with me compliment me on it all the time!

It's a novelty item and arrived exactly as described. That said, I probably should've paid better attention to the details/description or even other reviews because it was definitely bigger than I expected or actually wanted.  The details note it's 10cm, so about 4 inches, which is not something I'll be adding to my keychain or putting in my pockets anytime soon.  Don't get me wrong, I like it and have not had any problems with it breaking while compressing (even let my kids try and no problems), which is why the positive review, but it'll likely end up either hanging from my mirror or somewhere in the garage opposed to it's advertised/intended use.

Best wax i've ever used -- for best performance;  1-place this in sun or hot water then wash and clean car [may clay],  2- shake well and apply a very thin coat to one section at a time [one bottle has lasted me through 3-cars and 2-SUV's]. I apply to trim & windows also.  3- As it starts to haze wipe off with soft terry cloth or towels, and Buff with clean towels, terry cloth, or buffer.  Major points of emphasis --- warm and shake b/f use -- apply very thin coat -- leaves a deep shine to body, trim and wheels. Make sure you buff the windows extra well or will leave a film noticed as sun comes in.  I recommend applying a second coat no sooner than  1-hr after the first , gives it time to bond well. May use this or Collinite Marque D'Elegance Carnauba Paste Wax #915. i prefer the latter. Just don't use the #915 on trim or windows. The results you will find amazing!!! How long it lasts will depend on your habits of washing, climate and soaps you use, but it usually lasts much longer than anything you will find in auto or big box stores.  I'm retired and do waxing and detailing part time as a hobby. So i've used a lot of products.

Fantastic!  Lights up the neighborhood!  Everything included to complete project except wire connectors (and this was my toughest issue.  Being a novice, I had issue connecting the wires, hmm)  But nothing to do with shipper or product!  Bar hums in breeze between 55 and up but I don't do up much anyway and I was warned! (not an issue with me).  I had a switch waiting (I had already installed an a-panel switch pod with 4 switches and left wires for easy access) and the supplied wiring kit went right in no issue to connect to my switch.  I've already recommended this to a friend and would buy again.  No!  it's not a $300-400 bar but I can't tell difference and if I have issue I can rebuy (at $85) or go up in price.

Needed for my friends truck for radio I put in for him. The first one I bought has to be defective because the module box would not go off and would make the radio come on by itself, even if the car was off. So I went ahead and called the company itself, and explained what was going on. They said that it had to be defective.  So I ordered another, and like magic, worked perfectly, with no problems at all, and did not stay on. Just make sure you don't get a defective one!!!!

Shipment arrived well before promised. Ships direct from Hong Kong. I was pleased with weight and quality of the chrome. It did not come with directions but I was able to figure it out. I had to use the 2 additional brackets and some extra washers as spacers to make it fit snug. I would not say it's a perfect fit for my 2012 XL1200C, but I made it work. Looks great.  I like it.

This is a really great light. It has a strong magnetic base, bright light output and deep orange colors. The cord could be a little longer but it is okay at 10 feet. I think that if you ran it through your roof it would be long enough, but going through the window isn't great.  It has a nice little switch to control it on the back of the power plug. It is easy to press and makes a nice click when it changes to on or off. You cant really tell if the light is on when you are in your vehicle, so the power plug is labeled with an on and off position. I have used it in the rain and it clearly held up well. Overall, good little light, great value, and seemingly durable.

Bought this fuel line for a complete frame-off motorcycle restoration.  Within hours of filling the tank the first time, the hose had deteriorated right near where it connects to the tank and began leaking gasoline down all over the wiring harness, battery and freshly rebuilt engine - and causing sever damage to the brand spanking sparkly new powder coating!!!  So many hours and hundreds of dollars utterly ruined.  I verified this was the problem by cutting a piece of the new hose and putting it in a plastic container with some fresh gasoline - the new hose piece deteriorated again.  Avoid, get some real stuff, and make sure it's really rated to hold gasoline!

This item is 5/5 once it gets installed.  It functions nicely and does what it's supposed to do.  Of note, I have a 2013 Ford F150 FX4.Now, for the installation process I'd give it a 1/5 (hence the generous 3/5 overall rating).  Getting the ball mount properly installed on the tailgate with the given hardware was impossible.  I literally couldn't get it to work.  The base kept spinning when trying to install the screw-in ball mount portion, and there's not a thing I could do to prevent it (yes I tried the duck tape and every other piece of advice on these reviews...none worked in my case!).  Had I not been savvy and lucky, I never would have gotten it the ball mount installed.  This ball mount "nutsert" (the revet type portion that acts as the female portion that installs into the hole in the tailgate) is completely useless and was impossible for me to use as intended....it's basically a terrible design and Dee Zee should take heed of these reviews and get a better design.  It's not fair to the end-user  I consider myself pretty good with tools and projects like this...so I can't imagine what someone with less experience are dealing with during their install process.As for the fix, I happened to have a nut with an integral spinning washer (also known as a serrated flange nut) that fit the ball mount threading perfectly (sorry, I couldn't tell you the size).  I was able to barely finagle into place using really long needle nosed pliers inside of the tailgate itself.  This required me to remove the factory black plastic tailgate liner and carefully navigate the nut into place using a flash light and a lot of patience.  Thankfully, I was able to get the ball mount threads started into the nut.  After it got started, I kept the pliers firmly on the nut while I tightened down the ball mount by hand until the serrated portion making contact with the tailgate "bit" or "grabbed".  Eventually, the pressure on the nut held it stable as I continued to tighten it down with a deep socket wrench (and was able to release the pliers).  After that ball mount was successfully installed, the rest was easy peezy.As for concerns over the "lifespan" of the hydraulic assembly itself, I can't attest to it because I've only had mine on for about a month.  However, it's a component that WILL fail in time (they all do, remember those hatch back type cars from the 80s?) and that's to be expected.  I will be more than happy to purchase another one of these kits if and when the shock does fail, AS LONG AS I NEVER HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT NUTSERT/BALL MOUNT INSTALLATION  PROCESS AGAIN!! (which I won't because I used the flanged nut method of installation, which should last the life of the truck).Final analysis, this product is awesome when properly installed...I couldn't be happier with its performance.  However, the install process (as currently designed) sucks.  It took me about 3 hours from start to finish...95% of that time was spent getting that stupid ball mount in place on the tailgate.  You'll love the product if you decide to buy and go through the painstaking process of getting it on PROPERLY.  Patience is a must on this one.PS - I attached a photo of what a serrated flange nut looks like.  Since I couldn't tell you the size, I would take the ball mount to HD or Lowes and just match one with its threading.  GOOD LUCK!

These lifts are perfect. They fit as described, have a drop of grease pre-placed in the the ball slots, and make it super easy to pop on the new ones.Pros:- Strong lift.- Easy Install.- Obvious hardware.Cons:- This isn't a con, but it is something you need to be aware of. The clip mechanisms used to hold the ball in the slot require a screwdriver, THEY CAN PINCH!!! (Owwwwie.... :'[ )To install, prop your hood using something sturdy and remove the current lifts, noting which way the piston is oriented. (if the shiny part is higher or lower)Install the ball posts FIRST, making sure the provided washer in on as well. (My posts used a 1/2")Use a screwdriver to lift the clips on either end of the rod, but try not to pop them completely off. They will let the ball slide in and out if they are only mostly removed. It's okay if you do pop em off,,but easier if you don't.Again, make sure the piston is oriented properly. Place the ball in the slot, and use the end of your socket or other sturdy tool to "pop" the clip back down around the ball.Repeat this on all four slots.  It's that easy. Takes ten minutes of you know what you're doing.

Really nice LED`s for my Honda Pilot 2006.Pros: - Plug and Play installation - Easy to install - Really bright - Nice design - Great packingCons: - None so farAlways check what type of Headlight bulbs you need before purchasing! In my case my Honda Pilot 2006 uses H11 for low beams and 9006 for High beams.

WAAAAYYY better than what I expected to receive.Edit a year later: The Vibration from road considions (dust, mud wind, rain, water etc) caused the liners to rub and eat up the paint. do not recommend, however  they did work for their purpose, so maybe some rubber liner would had worked.

Wow! Notice the difference. I have a Camaro ss 2013 and I been abusing it ever since I got it. Track, street racing  ex. Stiffness on the steering wheel thus giving you more control. Don't expect a dramatic difference, but trust me you'll feel it. Remember it's more for a cosmetic look. If your looking for a dramatic difference, save money and get a performance suspension.

This doesn't look exactly the picture, although the size is the same. It has the battery connectors on the side like a standard battery.After 5 months I've had no issues with it on my 2005 Suzuki SV650 streetfighter bobber project. The weight loss was instantly noticeable, definitely worth the money in terms of weight savings. I also used it in my 2009 Yamaha WR250X but it was overkill in terms of cranking power and wasn't as noticeable of a weight difference from the small battery it replaced. I'd recommend something smaller if you have a 250 but it was perfect for the 650.I've had no issues keeping it charged as long as I ride about once a week. For a few months it was used daily on my commute to and from work (about 40 miles total). When the bike is being worked on I swap it into my supermoto so I've yet to need the trickle charger. I'll definitely be getting one for all my future projects.

I removed my OEM clutch fan in my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500 pickup truck.  Put this electric fan in as a replacement.  It fits fine.  I used some plastic through-the-radiator-slit ties at first, but will be fabricating a metal bracket to mount this fan. The plastic ties work fine, and actually keep the fan *fairly* snug up against the radiator. But the bottom of this fan shroud does NOT have holes to use the plastic ties. You can either drill holes in it yourself, build a bracket to support it, or let the bottom dangle (not recommended).It comes with a socket/plug to give it electricity from battery.I don't know what kind of plug that will plug into ... see photo to help me determine what kind of socket/jack that is.You can cut off the provided socket/jack connector and just splice the wires together if you choose.  I prefer to reuse the socket if I can find a male plug for it.Three fan wires are as follows:Brown with YELLOW stripe wire ----------> high-speed setting (preferred to use this over the low speed setting wire)Brownish with ORANGE stripe wire -----> low-speed setting (not preferred, so mine's not connected to anything.. ie. I left it "dead-ended", capped off, and disconnected)Black wire ----------------------------------------> Ground (no duh, right?)I opted to only have the fan's high-speed setting turn on when my temperature probe relay detected temp at or above 180 degrees (a separate product)Caution: this fan uses some higher amps, so I wouldn't go less than a 50 amp relay and fuse (Im actually using a 60 amp).  I think some have tried it with lower amp tolerance and have blown the fuse.

I had a '14 Rubicon X and had installed the previous series (8700 Evolution) lights.  I have a new '15 Wrangler Sport.  In 2 years, JW Speaker has greatly improved their products.  I purchased both the 8700 J-Series headlights and the 279 J Tail Lights.  Super!  Not only do both look good, they provide great brightness at night.Tail light install took about 15 minutes.  You do need a small Phillips screwdriver and a pair of pliers to install the resistor nuts and bolts.  I also needed a small flat screwdriver to get the tight fitting clips onto the resistor brackets.  The directions leave out one small step to assure the lights seat properly on the back of your Wrangler.  There are plastic "clips" on the light housing that need to slide under the metal body opening BEFORE you replace the factory screws.  If you aren't careful and don't slide them under the opening, the lights will not seat properly and have a firm seal.Pricey, but as others have said, you get what you pay for.  Great looking lights that keep you safe at night.

Had no idea how much I was missing this!  The way I have it positioned the view is  from one rear bimini support to the other and the entire rear end of the boat to include the motor.  Fantastic!  For how I mounted it there is one swivel point missing so I fabricated a simple frame to enable mounting high on the bimini top frame rather than the windshield.  Check out the pics of the install on my pontoon.  Perfect.  It comes with 3 different thicknesses of "wedges" that mount to one side inside the bracket jaws to accommodate various mounting thicknesses.  Choose the one you need.  This is the only one on the market that opens to 1 1/4" and fits standard pontoon rails.Put this thing on and relax a whole lot more.

I purchased these for my 2006 Lexus GS300 but contrary to Amazon's recommendation, they did NOT fit my car. You will see in the photo that Amazon says it will fit and in the other photo you can see that it's far shorter than the correct Denso plug. The engine ran rough on cold start and then would settle enough to drive it. I pulled and regapped the plugs only to have the symptoms persist. I purchased Denso 3473 plugs and when swapping them out I noticed the size difference. I gave the product five stars as the seller was great, the transaction was fast, and the plugs were packed well.

This key shell is tough alright, and a good buy. But you have to be careful how you intend to use it. The shell only works if you are replacing an ORIGINAL Lexus key shell, because Lexus makes the metal key part in the form of a "T", which fits into this replacement shell exactly. If you try to replace an after-market shell, you will have a lot of trouble, because they typically do NOT use a "T" for the metal portion - it is simply a straight shaft that is glued into the shell plastic, so when you take the metal piece out of the after-market shell, there is no metal on the sides of the key shaft for this replacement shell to grab onto when you screw it together - and it simply won't work. The after-market metal key portion will simply fall out of the replacement shell. See the key in the upper-right hand picture for the correct shape of the metal portion. If you can't see any metal on each side of the key shaft you plan to use, then it probably won't work.

I've tested the battery an getting 3.10 volts out of a 3 volt battery so it's good. it is the remote itself that is bad.

I upgraded my audio system, but I was getting a weird tin sound echo coming from the doors. I looked into it and found sound insulation helps so I decided to give it a shot. I took the doors apart and insulated the entire inside skin and some of the outside panel parts. After putting it back together it sounds a lot better. The doors feel a lot heavier and close with a heavy thump compared to before. When you knock on the doors it no longer sounds like a tin can it sounds like a solid slab of metal. Inside cabin is quieter from road noise and outside the truck is quieter when you're blasting music. Win/Win for everyone. I'm pretty sure most people can do four doors and still have materiel left over, but I kind of went overboard and only had enough to cover 3 doors. Overall I'm really pleased with this product. You just have to be slightly careful when installing because the aluminum foil part can get sharp and it will cut you. Don't ask how I know. If you wear gloves you'll be fine, but there's little nooks and crannies where the gloves get in the way so you have to go RAW to get it in lol. I highly recommend this product.

The tach works good really good but the back light is way to bright even when hooked into the factory dimmer switch instalation was about 3 hours because instructions where limited and resorces online for my specific vehicle where limited when trying to find schematics for my factory dimmer switch and like many have stated the back light is wayyyyy to bright they would of been better off using a regular dash bulb for this thing think im just gonna cut the back light wires and leave it as a none back lite tach over all for the price of this thing its definitly worth it

I ordered two of these and they simply don't fit properly. I have a 2015 Golf and 2017 GTI and though it is supposed to a genuine VW accessory, VW missed the mark here. It's FAR from an exact fit with mine having several inches of gap on either side of the windshield. I also feel that, even for cars with the rain sensor where the rearview mirror is, the cutout in the center is pretty large compared to what it could be.I'll be returning both of these tomorrow.

Install was fairly easy and when it works, it works very well, only have a couple of complaints#1 my first sensor (4.9) only lasted a month, i thought no big deal and chocked it off as an issue with the tune burning up the sensor, so i spent the $60 on a new sensor and all was well.#2 6 months later after a retune and car runing very well (daily driver ) my wideband just quit working one day, no lights or anything on the lc2 control box, a couple days later it starts working but im getting an error code #8, which pretty much means bad sensor, again i understand they don't last that long, but the first only lasted a month and this one only lasted 6 months in a daily driver .... . the reason im a bit upset is because you cannot have these sensors installed in the exaust stream without them being powered up, therefore the day this lc2 decided to not work is the reason my sensor is now dead, im awaiting a response from innovate, id like a new lc2 and sensor since its of no fault of my own that the second sensor AND lc2 are malfunctioning,Editing the review since I'm going through yet another sensor, innovate needs to fix this junk, look online before you buy, there are tons of bad reviews on this widebandif innovate sends me replacements i will bump this review back up to 5 stars, again its a great product!!!!! but only when it works !!! reliability is key with widebandsone more thing i don't like is the serial data connection for programming and data logging with the lc2, its just outdated and requires the use of a converter to usb, only like $10, but still, its just unnecessary, laptops don't even have serial ports anymore.

Yes, I do have a milk crate on the back of my bike. Anyways, I throw all my crud in the crate to save my back the weight on my daily 150 mile round trip on highway and then up the mountain to the house in the end. This net grips the crate perfectly and gives allot of strech for the larger boxes I may put in there. As of yet no rips or breaks, and I have yet to loose anything out of it. Happy purchase.

Worked great with just 3 coats and some wet sanding.  The clear is matte and not gloss, which I wasn't sure about doing, but I think it turned out okay with the matte clear.  The clear tended to overspray a bit, thus only giving 4 stars - but that could just be me - I was able to buff it off.  Had to mask off and spray on the car or remove the entire rear end to get the tails off.  Was easier to pull the bezels off and mask.

So far I like it but have yet to wire it up. Honestly this thing will never achieve 5 star status at its price, man it is expensive and the under hood kit with 2 lights, a switch and some ft of wiring is a joke at 100$+. Enclosure quality does seem good though. The main reason I am writing this review is to provide people with the actual dimensions of the light...

These are great. I was a bit concerned when ordering about some having issues with the mounting bracket holes lining up however that wasn't an issue for me at all. They were shipped in a box and packaged extremely well. There was zero damage from shipping. When I installed them every hole lined up perfectly and both rail steps only took me maybe 20 mins to install. Really didn't even look at the directions, common sense shows how they are mounted. They seem to be of good quality and fairly heavy duty. They definately give my truck the look I was after and so worth the price.

As another reviewer said, the nut on this mount does not work with the bolt from the OEM mount. It's either too small (as the very tip of the bolt is actually more narrow than the rest) or it has been machined with the wrong bolt pattern. Either way, it wasted lots of my time and I had to put the old mount back on.I know it worked well for other reviewers in the past - maybe Eagle BHP changed providers or they made a bad batch? Whatever the reason, mine has proven to be completely useless.

Installed on my 2008 Honda Accord EXLPros: Very easy to install. You can do it in under an hour with just a few wrenches/sockets and little mechanical knowledge. It comes with a picture step by step guide for Honda's and Acuras.Sounds amazing. Makes your engine growl when halfway and onwards on the throttle.I definitely notice an improvement in throttle response and acceleration versus the stock intake.Looks sweet in the engine baySlight improvement of mileage if you don't floor it all dayCons: The only real downside is that you do in fact increase the amount of debris making it into your engine which can cause problems down the road.Price was around 300 when i got it. Fair for what you get but could be a con for others.

I used this arm on the driver's side of my 1978 International Harvester Scout II.  The idea is great and now I can use modern blades.  However, the spring is WAY too heavy.  It causes the wiper blade to stutter as it travels.  I went to the hardware store to get a lighter spring.  I may need to try another as this may be too light.  Still better than the stock spring.  It's a big improvement.  You can see in the picture the arm with the replacement spring and the original spring (original spring not in the arm).

The Good:- Nice looking and solid feeling light.- Lenses give the light a nice tight pattern.The Bad:- Much dimmer than expected, on par with a 600 lumen "Fish Eye" lens handheld flashlight.- Does not have 5 watt LEDs as advertised.I attached pictures of my setup with a Fluke ammeter to measure the current going to the light when energized. It should draw more power than the Rigid Dually which has 3 Watt LEDs. It draws less. This does not have 5 Watt LEDs. I hooked one of these to my 13.8V power source and was disappointed at how dim it was. I checked it against a 600 Lumen LED Lenser focused to a spot of the same diameter at the same distance. The Auxbeam might be slightly brighter.

I bought these for my break lights (leds i bought). They fit perfectly on my honda 2010 ridgeline..yes they get hot but who cares.. Just don't let it touch any plastic..i used copper wire to tie it to the truck. oh one thing is when you are putting the socket into the truck socket..be careful not to bend the contact on the truck socket...another thing is they do take a while to come but it's worth the wait..  Buy them if you don't want to cut into your oem wiring.

Got it the other day and I am very happy. It fits my bike really well- a 2003 VZ800 Marauder. I assume it has the stock sissybar mount, but I have no idea. It's worth mentioning that on my bike at least I couldn't have this rack and the sissybar at the same time, they are both just as wide as each other at the mounting point. Also, comes with no mounting screws or nuts or bolts and is not threaded, so you may need to run to the hardware store before installing it.Also, I was recommended that I could install the TMS TBOX-JK1001-K on this rack. I did, and you can, but it isn't as simple as I hoped. that box's mounting holes don't work with this rack- you'd have to drill extra holes through the rack to use them. Easier to just drill new holes in the topbox instead (though I drilled two extra holes because I screwed up). it works, but it isn't as clean as I'd hoped it would be. Absolutely not the rack's fault, just something for prospective buyers to know about.

It would've been perfect if the bolt was centered in the bore. It was severely misaligned and so was the flare.Overall, I was satisfied with the replacement item. Consistently made very good bubbles and double flares. The problem with the common practice (that the length of the tube is the same thickness as the back of the die), is that the resulting flare is a bit small. I opted for the length that is equal to the thickness of the middle of the die. See the picture attached. This resulted in fuller flares, be it bubble or double. I didn't have any leak whatsoever and this is my first time to make brake lines.

I'm a DIY type so I liked the fact that these bags didn't have any predrilled holes, since I already have a set of my own design saddlebag mounts. They are a replacement I decided to purchase for the smaller hard bags made by the same company. I decided the medium sized bags just weren't big enough and they had some hinge and lock issues I didn't care for and I'm wishing I had purchased these from the beginning because they fit my bike much better and the locking mechanism and hinges are a lot better. They look really good on my Customized XV700 Yamaha and being black, they are a perfect match to my bike. While some may balk at "plastic" bags, my experience with the medium bags has been that it's pretty tough material that maintains a nice shine. All in all these are very good low cost bags for bikers on a budget and they look really good.

Everything was easy to install and worked without a problem. I really considered the 8000 but so glad i went with the 6000. Just a hint of blue. Super bright. Love emFOLLOW UP:  I have replaced the low beam unit 2 times, fog light unit once and hi beam unit once.... I will say, WHEN they work they are great. But, its a real headache when they sometimes work, one will work or they just crap out all together. The company has held its end on the warranty, but you can imagine the headache of the item breaking, then spending 2 days emailing them, then waiting for the shipment to arrive.... Having a quality control issue would be putting it lightly.I guess I would generalize this as these are garbage. Spend a few more dollars and go with better quality product. I will leave these in until the warranty expires, then upgrade. They continue to send replacement parts

I am leaving this a 3 bc you can totally tell it is painted.  There are little pin size spots everywhere, where it looks like debris was painted over. There are very cool looking but I'm not sure if I'm going to keep them bc I can tell they're not going to hold up.  Maybe I got a bad set,  idk. Even the top edge of both of them is not painted all all.  What happened to getting chrome items that where made of stainless steel,  not plastic.  I have had them for a couple months and they seem ok on the vehicle.

When I tried this wax, I was a little skeptical. I've used a lot of carnauba waxes and this one really surprised me. My car looked so good after I applied this wax. I have a dark blue car and the depth that this wax added to my car was unbelievable. The flakes on my car just POPPED!  It is a very nice wax and this tub will last you for A long time. A little goes a long way. I have found that this wax is best to apply one panel at a time instead of 2 or 3 and using a short nap microfiber towel also helps. Again, this is the method that works for me. It might not work for you so it's best to do a test spot on your car.

This stuff is really awesome! I washed my car then did a good claybar session, and then used  Meguiers cleaner paste wax. After the paste wax dried and hazed up good, I wiped it off. The shine was pretty good with just the meguires. Then I sealed the car with Finish Kare. I applied Finish Kare to the paint and windows. I let dry and wiped it off with no trouble at all. This wax does give the illusion of adding another layer of clear coat to the car paint. I read a review that said that and couldn't believe it, but now that I have used it I totally agree. The shine is very reflective and glossy and the paint is super slippery. A few days later it rained on my way to the office. I was amazed at the beading factor I did not have to turn on the wipers cause the rain was just beading off so quickly with the wind. I parked my car in the garage barely wet. When I came out for lunch the car was completely dry and it looked like it hadn't been in any rain. I was in shock, this stuff is the bomb!

Do yourself a favor and buy a better air freshener. These things are if poor quality. Usually when I buy a new air freshener, the aroma is very potent for the first few days. Removing thse from the packaging you can barely smell them even if you held your nose to them. They also do not come individually wrapped. So as soon as you open the box all of them have an expiration date. With that being said I just used all of them since the others were going to lose their smell in my glovebox. Even on a hot sunny day where the heat would evaporate the oils in the freshener faster, the aroma was barely noticeable. They are also ugly to look at and have a poor "wedge" clip design that isn't very secure.

I used different clips and screws to put these into my Audi S5 and they work great.  It's great to be able to hang bags and prevent them from sliding around in my trunk during those spirited drives (at a legal speed of course!)  Spring-loaded keeps them out of the way when not needed.

This kit is something everyone should have in their vehicles!  Many people drive around hoping for AAA to rescue them in an emergency, but the average wait for a tow truck or someone to help you is two hours (we learned recently).This kit has almost everything needed to survive a minor road emergency.  And it has room in the bag to add a few more items if needed.  Our family is very into emergency preparedness so I have an extensive selection of tools, personal protection, food, water, etc., in case of need.The first thing I'd like to point out is the 8 gauge copper jumper cables.  Many emergency kits have jumper cables but unless they're 10 gauge or below they aren't strong enough to jump start most cars.  Having your jumper cables smoking and refusing to start your car just adds to your stress!There's also a handy reflective triangle to alert cars of your upcoming breakdown, and a reflective vest so you don't get hit in traffic.  Add in the glow sticks and you'll be visible even in a downpour.  The glowsticks are also good for calming down scared children, as we found out one time.  I'll also add that I've never had a flat tire or breakdown except in the pouring rain.  The rain poncho and emergency blanket are great for keeping everyone warm and dry until help arrives.There are lots of other useful tools and even very basic medical supplies in this kit.  I plan to add a few more medical items (Quick-Clot, neosporin, Benadryl), a power bank to charge a cell phone, a can of fix-a-flat, a tire gauge, a few water bottles and snack bars.  This will go in my son's car as he heads out to college next year.Included in this kit:- reflective safety vest and triangle- glow sticks to alert passing vehicles- multi-tool- whistle- hand crank flashlight- tow straps- bungee cords- rain poncho and emergency blanket- first aid including gauze, tape, antiseptic toilets, bandaids-  8 gauge copper jumper cables (lower number is better, read above)- PVC reflective gloves- duct tape- crescent wrench- zip ties- emergency whistle- window breaking, seat belt cutting toolOverall this is an EXCELLENT basic emergency kit.  You can always build upon it, but this is a great place to start.I received a complimentary Always Prepared Roadside Auto Emergency Kit for testing and review purposes. I wasn't asked to leave a positive review, nor was I paid or otherwise compensated for reviewing this product. Look at the hundreds of reviews I've written over fourteen years and you'll see that I work hard to give an honest opinion of the products I review.

Neither of the threaded rings provided fit my Briggs and Stratton 5-gallon gas can, but that was no big deal because the original threaded ring worked just fine with the spout.  (see picture)  I also like that the spout cap is threaded and screws on for a tight fit.  Note that the instructions call for the use of a step drill bit to drill the hole for the vent.  Fortunately, I already had one, but if you don't, you may want to consider adding one to your order that will cut a 3/8" hole.  No leaks when pouring gas, and I can fill my riding lawn mower's two-gallon tank up in about 30-seconds.  Awesome!

Fairly simple to put on. I had my first set for three years. I live in the country, so I am constantly driving on dirt roads. They have worn beautifully for the quality. I had a few scratches so I bought another set. You couldn't really tell there was scratches but I could so I wanted some fresh ones. Now I keep my first set for back up ones. I love the looks of these and they last FOREVER.Just keep the clean and wash them. When I'm driving they look like real rims. And to the untrained eye, people always ask me if they're real. I am currently on month three of my second set and they still look awesome! I'll probably ride these out another three years! For 30 bucks and lasting 3 years, I'd say these are definitely worth it! For reference my vehicle is a 2011 Camry 16"

I used this wheel on my dirt track street stock as a cheaper alternative to normal Aero or Bart racing wheels. Bolt pattern fits Ford 9 inch rear ends, which my race car had. Ran a full season with the wheel on the left rear of the car and had no issues. I ran pretty hard on it, including a few off track excursions (see picture). I would certainly recommend it!

This is a quality product.  Have used it for years in my "old"- owned since it was new- 1988 Lincoln Mark VII.  Car has ABS brakes that utilize a high pressure  pump and an accumulator affair as well as the conventional half liter or so capacity master cylinder fluid reservoir.  On this 300,000 mile 1988 vehicle,  I have always flushed out the system every 3 years.....Even in the high humidity environment of Vancouver BC, to the dry air in Las Vegas, the litmus strips have always indicated the fluid is still serviceable after two years.  Color stable.  2 Liters to flush.That said, AutoZone and Napa and O'Reilly etc. sell it for less than what I paid on Amazon.

I thought I was going to have problems with it but I got it installed with few problems.  One cable should have been set up differently to make installation much easier.  See the first picture the bigger cable should be closest to the battery.  I couldn't get it arranged that way.

Love this product as I previously had my car treated with CQuartz by a professional. 4 Years later I wanted to have my car redone but didn't want to spend the same amount of cash having the paint correction performed and fee to apply this product. Took a few nights after work to perform paint correction then a short amount of time to fully apply this CQUARTZ UK. I read articles and then watched some YouTube videos before applying. Just test a small amount of surface to determine the amount of time you have to remove the product after applied. I found myself personally going from 30secs to a little over a minute before having to buff off the product with the provided towel. My suggestion would be to get extra high GSM count microfiber towels to use instead of the towel provided. Do NOT apply in the sun!!! Make sure you're in cool environment.

Light looks to be 3000k or 3500k. When I read 'warm' I think of 2700k which is what I was hoping. I might have read 3000 someplace which is why I didn't give it less stars. My transformer now hums and if I don't leave at least 1 of the incandescent bulbs, they all blink... MI think I need a new transformer :(.  But so far they all work. I replaced 21 today.Hard to tell but the 2 lights on the left are LED.

Like others have written, I also went to the hardware store and purchased two screws that I could take out if I want to move it around. Seems very solidly built, chrome is good quality and it fits just perfectly. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that when you close the hinge down, you do have to have the key in and twist it slightly to lock it. I placed mine right in front of me on the handlebars. I like that spot because with the helmet attached it looks like it's just sitting on top of the front of the gas tank. And no upside down rain bucket!

Despite having headquarters in Northern California, this company manages to try to pass total crap off as first quality, high end tools.  It's sad because this tool had a lot of potential.  It is sturdily made and has nice action.  However, the hex shaped bit holding hole in the business end was so far off-center it was a joke.  So did they reject it as not being first quality?  Hell no! They ground off the tip on the widest side in an attempt to make it look more centered.  So if you want to pay first quality prices for junk, this is the way to go.  Otherwise, look at PB Swiss.  Thy even store 5 x 1" bits in the t handle.  The Mo-Pro looked like a second grader built it, fixed it and passed it on QC.[...]

This (these?) mat (s?) is/are the best deal going when it comes to protecting the carpets of my 2016 Buick Enclave. Nearly every part that needs to be covered are and I don't have to worry when people are moving in and out of my 2nd and 3rd row seats no matter what the time of year. I like to keep my cars in pristine condition so getting all-weather mats is one of the first things I do. I was going to buy the OEM ones from the dealer, but they cost an outrageous amount for EACH row and didn't cover nearly as much of the carpets as this one piece mat covers. This Maxliner setup covers not only in front of the seats, but between and the outside edges. It's truly full coverage.Installation of this was a little tricky, but starting from the center and working out ended up being the best way to get this in place with the least amount of frustration.I'm thrilled that I decided to go this route. Great value, well made and full coverage. It's more than I could ask for!If attached photos don't upload, you can find them here: imgur.com/a/A1kWy

Bought in September for use in Maine.Fit well and worked before submersion into water.Went to use my boat for the first time on fourth of July. While checking the light, the light that was in the water less than a dozen times was not working.I removed the lens and light to check why. The bubble capsule that holds the bulb had two ounces of water.Now the bulb socket is corroded.Really not worth the money if you only get a few uses.West Marine gives an additional warranty for just these instances.

I like that these have the Jeep name on them and they fit exactly into my Cherokee. They aren't too slippery and they meet the need for protecting my floor. I was disappointed in how they were folded and pressed into the shipping box. When they arrived, there were some warped spots where they had been folded or compressed. They are flattening out a little now that I have had them in the car for two weeks. But, they definitely aren't pristine. You'll see on the photos what I mean.I would give it 5 stars if they had arrived in the condition they ought to have with the right packaging.

Purchased this last week, had it installed.  Sound noise is about the same as my hard top, so no complaints there.  Looks GREAT on the jeep, and so much easier to take down than I expected.  The first time I put it up, it was tough, but it has since stretched and is a piece of cake now.  This is a one person job.  Which is what I needed. The plastic windows aren't as dark as factory back windows. I need to figure out how to make them darker.  I live in Houston, and it's HOT down here 9 months out of the year.

I have three of these. They are all within a volt or two of each other.  These are a must have in the RV world where plug in power is far from reliable.  Some folks spend BIG money on power monitors.  At a glance I know if I am running on internal DC or external power and the quality of that power.  I can monitor shore power and generator output loading.  To top it all off, this serves as a perfect night light in my RV bathroom as well as in my home bathroom.  The third one I gave to my parents for their RV.This can be plugged in in either direction; up side down, right side up.  Both plug spades are narrow to allow for it.Why have a dumb night light?  For the same price, it can be smart.

I bought this guage to monitor transmission fluid temps when towing a 4300 lb boat with my 2003 Ford Explorer. I bought a Trick Flow deep trans pan from Summit Racing (sorry Amazon, you didn't stock it !) and installed that too. I had a friend tap a 1/8 NPT port (for the temp sensor) on the rear side of the pan. I mounted this guage (alongside a Max Tow engine oil temp guage) at the forward end of the console. (see picture)  The temperature when towing on 95 degree days stays between 160-1185 degrees. The 5 speed trannys in the Exploders are known to overheat. Fluid is cooled by 3 ways: hot fluid out to factory cooler, then to a B & M auxiliary cooler, and then to the deep sump Trick Flow pan. So far, so good. No issues. Some reviewers said the guages are bright. Yes, they are, but being mounted at the forward part of the console keeps the light down low enough so that it doesn't interfere with night time driving. All in all, great guage and Amazons great price.

Sounds and looks great on my 2009 Dodge Caliber R/T, which is a 2.4l 4cyl engine. Had it professionally installed at my local muffler shop.  Doesn't sound ricer.Onlycomplaint is a "ting"ing sound I hear occasionally due to the muffler being very hot. But that's expected. I would recommend to a friend.

Got this set to use as under hood lighting since Toyota neglected to put a light under there. I was concerned about the heat coming from my engine with these, but there have been zero issues with the heat. They put out the right amount of light that it illuminates my engine compartment, but not enough to blind me. Now just have to figure out what to use the other two lights for.

Waited till I put em to good use before reviewing. I couldn't be happier, these springs are fantastic. Settled to current height quickly, and haven't sagged at all since(2500mi and counting). Paired these with ProComp ES3 shocks, perfect match. Plenty of flex off-road, comfortable ride on the street, and stable handling even with no rear sway bar. No regrets, money very well spent.

Took about 15 minutes to install including test fitting. Only time will tell on durability. So far I like!!Well now the rest of the story. Apparently I did not read the directions correctly and did not put the front ones on quite right so I called Lund Industries the manufacturers of Auto Ventshade. I must say I will now switch to 5 stars the service they give is second to none. Like I said I made the mistake and just called for recommendations on how to remove the front ones and see if I could order just a set for the front windows. Well the young lady that answered the phone asked if I would send her some pictures of the install which I did. After she reviewed the pictures she explained what I had done wrong also told me how to get them off and said if I sent her proof of purchase she would send me another full set which I should have in 5 to 7 days after she sent me a tracking number....Wrong 2 days later they were at my door. I really appreciatethe company taking care of me even when I make the mistake. They will have a customer for life with me!!

Nice addition and great place to set up all my switches. Im kind of disappointed that it does not fit exactly as it should but its not so bad that it cant be used. Its a bit wider than it should be. Its held in place with a snap in clip that you remove from the existing pillar cover and 1 screw that you removed and a piece of pre-applied tape that won't touch anything because of the mold being slightly wider than it needed to be, so its pretty useless. You can press it in to make contact but with in a few minutes, mine popped right back off. It does not rattle or move what so ever so it fits well but is just molded a bit too wide where it goes over the A pillar. It obstructs the side of the speaker on top of the dash which is where I used to set my sunglasses so they don't slide all over the dash. The plastic is easily scratched so be very careful in removing the blanks for switches. They are pretty hard to cut out with out cutting off any thing you need to keep attached to your hand. You cant really get in from the back to cut them out. I used a razor knife / box cutter, went slowly and still managed to get a nice deep scratch in the third slot down.

My 16 foot Car Capsule surrounds my 15  foot 1995 Mercedes SL 320 perfectly. I was concerned about which size to order, but the size recommended in the product description was right on. This is a well constructed item that sets up easily and inflates quickly. The base platform is a heavy-duty PVC mat that stands up to fluid drips and leaks. The upper bubble is a thick, clear plastic dome that stands over 6 feet high when fully inflated. The sides of the bubble bulge out sufficiently to clear the side view mirrors and allow room to enter the car when necessary. The fan inflates the bubble remarkably quickly and features a filter to keep dust and dirt out of the enclosure. The material is thick enough to keep mice and other pests from damaging your car, and in fact, would require quite a deliberate effort to puncture or damage it. The instructions state that no heat source, even a light bulb, should be placed inside the bubble. I have a battery maintainer in the bubble that is slightly warm to the touch that is not a problembut since the bubble is in my unheated equipment shed there is no way it could raise the temperature to a harmful degree. I recommend the Car Capsule without reservation.

This looks and feels like a quality product,  and for light use may be okay; after perhaps 1000 miles of towing (around 7500lb), however, the lock pawls inside the head left dents on the shaft (from sideways force on the head that occurs while towing), rendering it impossible to remove the lock barrel without a pry bar. To use it again, I'd need to file it down. Disappointing.

Works as advertised. Now I have a bit more confidence in hoping my tailgate does become the victim of theft since the MasterlLock tailgate lock was absolutely useless. The Pop & Lock was a breeze to install. One thing I did not do was flip the driver side latch rod end to end. They said it was optional and without doing so might lead to premature failure. The trouble is that when it is flipped it can no longer be secured and guided at its mid-point. Losing that feature, in my opinion, is more likely to cause premature failure as the rod could more easily become unattached at either end or even bent due to too much play. The rod works perfectly well in its original position. Why mess with and bypass Toyota's design?

I have a 1995 Jeep Wrangler 2 door and the drivers side handle broke off on one side where the little piece of metal is attached to the door.  I only ordered one handle cause I didn't want to replace both if I didn't have to but hoped that they would match. Upon opening the package I could tell it would match my passenger side handle. It took 5 minutes to remove the old handle and install the new one. I'm very happy with my purchase.

I couldn't get it to work because when i wired it to go up - it was choking and shaking the whole trailer. This resolved the problem and it's smooth sailing now!Top: To remove on from remoteSides: 12v to winch/pump motorFront: IDK I didn't use it.

Fantastic little addition to my RX-8!  I love how these look.  The only problem with them is that the car looks so nice now that sometimes I stand around looking at it instead of getting in it and driving.  ;)These came unpainted and a black ABS plastic.  I'm sure they could be painted, but on my white 8 I actually really like the look of the black.

Not very easy to get on.  But works.  I had to carefully pound them on (was risky) - because the rubber that came with them was too thick.  Ultimately, this made them even tighter.  It took away some of the wind noise in the cab for sure.

I absolutely love these lights. The colors do blend and give off a different shades than you would expect. The white does have some pinkish purple. I do  other recommend downloading the app that the scan q wants you to download for the fact it will create a virus on your device. Just download the bludim app and it will work just fine. The only thing I don't care for is that the Bluetooth connection is not strong. It says it has a 25ft signal receiver but if I were to get my device 10 ft away it will more than likely disconnect and you will have to turn the lights off and try to reconnect.

Made connecting my new Curt Brake controller dummy proof. Simply plug in to the controller, the other end into the vehicle (under dash on driver side). Plug-and-play: can't get better than that.

Ordered these with hesitation from some of the negative reviews, but can say they are a good quality mirror. Installed on a 2003 f250 with out any problems other than the tab needed clipped as all the  other purchasers said. Wiring plugged directly into the truck just have to wire the lights in separately. Great upgrade from the old style mirrorsUpdateFinished hooking the lights up and upgraded the bulbs to led. Looks great and really like the mirrors, highly recommend them for anyone looking to upgrade

I guess they will grow on me.  Will add same armor for both rear tail lights to finish off.  Don't put these on unless as others stated to add additional 3m doubled sided tape.  Make sure surface is clean of wax and alighn well before pressing on.  I'd suggest adding these for both pop and Mirrow dent protection.  It's worth the money.  Fast delivery but noInstructions even though a no brainer. Get left and right side set correct and press good while in warm but not hot sun.  Test will come with auto car wash !  0verall pleased.

I really thought I had done enough research on this product before I ordered, and applied to my car.  It looks really good after painting on, which was no problem (3 coats on some fairly large brakes), even in the hot Arizona sun.  But about a year later I'm left with the peeling paint after repairing the front right caliper and cleaning with brake cleaner.  for those that might wonder, yes the color is off too, but the darker blue grew on me.  I also cleaned the calipers completely with brake cleaner and wire brush before painting.Next time i will purchase the same high temp enamel paint I have used in the past and skip this product.

Works great on my chevy c1500 1993 4.3lAlso try to replace the A/C Accumulator and condenser and u will love your vehicle again. Pleople complains that it failed or get hot well maybe they ignored that there are two other parts to replace. If the condenser that looks like the radiator is blocked by the dirtiness then is obviously that this compressor will fail soon or later again. I replaced all these 3 parts and my a/c is like a brand new vehicle.also noticed a big difference on my engine's performance. It doesn't feel forced like it did before. Spend a little more money but do the job right. If you just replace one old part is like buying a brand new radiator and filling it with your old antifreeze with dirt and any other contaminants which will fail soon or later. Same thing with the A/C system.

I installed the ride rite kit 2015 Tacoma, they fit perfectly. The Firestone air system is very effective. I use it to stop the bounce when I haul my travel trailer. Now, I have a level load with no bounce. I don't recommend purchasing a "T" fitting if you plan on putting heave payloads in your bed. Driving around curves causes your center of gravity to shift from inside the curve to outside the curve. This can cause increased pressure on the air bag that's on the outside wheel and cross filling to the inside bag raising the body of the truck as the inside airbag inflates. The shift can cause a roll over accident. The kit has fittings for two inflation valves for this express reason. They are meant to operate independently. This a great product and I would recommend the purchase to anyone.

Long story short, these are good mirrors to see behind yourself.  They happend to shake out of place slowly on my '96 Harley Sportster 1200 because the ball mount up on the back of the mirror is not sturdy enough to handle my paintshaker.  That said, they don't vibrate as badly as other mirrors I had tried and I can safely see what's going on behind me.  These mirrors are big and a bit dorky, but the stems are short.  They work perfectly for what I needed and the quality is OK.  They're not the nicest thing out there, but they're not a joke either.  The price is a good price for what you're getting.  Take a look at my photo and decide if you can live with a couple of chrome mickey mouse ears like that on your bike.  I can.  My safety is more important than my rock star status.

First of all this was the largest purchase I've ever made with amazon, skeptical and hesitant I made the purchase. I have a 2000 Road King classic it has the leather bags which I never liked I found these and fell in love. I made the purchase and within I'd say 2-3 days I receive a call from the company that was sending them to ensure they fit my bike prior to sending them (which they did) the customer service was excellent and even sold me the hardware kit to go with the bags which were included within the same box. The only complaint I have about the bags was is the fact that when the bags were made there was excess plastic that wasn't cut properly however since it was on the bottom I didn't mind and also the chrome latch included within the hardware latch kit for the saddle bags was made of plastic. Overall great purchase there already painted and ready to be mounted and I've recommended them to my family members!

I agreed to evaluate this TMH spot lamp from LED Village after purchasing a pair of the flood beam version of the same unit.  As with the flood lamps, this thing is very impressive.  The aluminum housing is very rugged and comes with stainless steel hardware.  It is not the highest grade stainless but better than using nickel plated bolts that will quickly rust.  The mount is simple, sturdy and functional.  The lens is crystal clear and appears to be hermetically sealed.When running some electrical tests I observed that the lamp throws a very intense, focused beam which complements the flood lamps nicely.  The measured brightness across the central beam was narrow and symmetrical as advertised.  The measured current (I) draw was only 1150 milliamps @ 13.47VDC.Applications:  Of course I will have to purchase more to make it happen but, I have applications that include my tractor, pickup camper, Jeep and possibly over the deck area of two trailers.  They are bit large for my quads and snowmobiles but TMH also makes a model that is a perfect size for those too.  The construction of these lamps appears water tight but I did not test for this.  So, as a precaution for marine applications, I would highly recommend applying additional sealant where the cable enters the housing.  Moist salt air is a real killer for electronics!Bottom line:  These are impressive lamps in general but, for the money, they are a fantastic value.  Thanks LED Village!

I just love Amazon. Ordered this around 11:30am today and I received it 6.5 hours later!Anywho, I ordered this first for the fact that it has lifetime warranty and, second, it's less than $20.  It comes in a tin case and inside it also comes with instructions as seen on the pic I'm including with this review.  So I've only had it less than an hour and it feels hefty and well built.  If seen the more expensive one which some of my fellow wheelers use and I can't seem to find a difference at the moment other than the brand name.  I will update on this later on after I calibrate and set this up and use it.  Until then, I think it's a good buy.

This dual pack is great (H11 for my fog lights and 9005 for my DRLs). Both come in 6K color but my dog lights come out a yellowish-green because I have a yellow wrap over my fog lights. So far, so good. The lights are super bright. They come with a 1 year warranty and I was impressed by the bulb quality. I would definitely recommend and Ill probably purchase more in the future if needed for other vehicles.

I did a LOT of research and testing before deciding on these bars.  We purchased these for our 2013 Toyota Rav4.  The OEM Toyota cross bars seemed like an afterthought on the part of Toyota so those weren't an option for us.  I'll list some of the pros of going with the Thule AeroBlade Edge bars over the OEM Toyota bars:-- The AreoBlade Edge bars strap on to the side rails where the OEM bars use a pressure-type screw to secure themselves to the side rails.-- AeroBlade is rated to hold more weight (but you still need to consider the manufacturer limits for weight).-- The plastic "feet" (that's the part on either end of the bar that connects to the side rail) on the OEM bars extend too far inward on the rear OEM bar.  That is, the usable surface of the rear OEM bar is really only about 20" where the Thule AeroBlade Edge bars have smaller feet and can accommodate our very wide Thule Cargo box.-- Appearance.  I know this is subjective but I've yet to find someone who doesn't like the look of the AeroBlade bars on our Rav4.  I honestly think that these look more like they belong than the Toyota bars.-- T-track capability on the AeroBlade bars.  I have not utilized the T-Track *yet* but I plan to do so.  There is no similar functionality on the Toyota crossbars.The other benefit of these is that they accept our older-style, U-shaped attachment for our Thule Evolution 1600 Cargo box... and they fit PERFECTLY.  These bars are almost completely silent on our Rav with the sunroof shade closed (any bar you put up there will make *some* sound).  One of the best aspects is the lower profile of these bars.  I tried another style of Thule bars but the feet and bar stood up off of the roof so much so that I couldn't pull in and out of our garage with our box on top.  That may not be a big deal to some others but for me it is since we tend to come home or depart for trips late at night.  I don't have to be fidgeting around in the dark!  I can just pull right in.  If another Rav4 owner is reading, I would be glad to send you measurements that I took in regards to implementing these so you can see if your box will fit through your garage opening.Finally, I must say that the customer support I received from Thule has been great!  I have had these bars for 7 months now.  I had a COSMETIC flaw on one of my bars and within a few minutes on the phone, Thule customer service was making it right.  For a COSMETIC flaw... one that does not even impact the usability of the product!I would highly recommend these to anyone looking to add more utility to their vehicle.  I am not affiliated with Thule in any way whatsoever but I would be happy to answer any questions that I can in regards to these bars.  I know they are expensive but it's my opinion that you get what you pay for in regards to these types of accessories and it's well worth the cost for the added utility and even the added looks!!2 year update:I'm happy to report that after 2 years of these being on top of our Rav4, They are still in great shape.  These seem to  have held up great.  I just transferred them to our new Toyota Sienna (2016).  I was worried that they wouldn't fit since the Sienna is larger but the same size (7502) ended up fitting on the Sienna van.  I haven't yet driven with them on to comment on gas mileage decline or wind noise but my wife hasn't said anything about it.  I'll update if it's a real problem.  Added a photo!

I only had the scuffed handle part left on a truck I just purchased.  Popped it off with a butter knife and replace both parts, fast, easy, and looks great.  Attaches with 3m tape "included" very easy to install.  UPDATE:  The surround piece is coming loose on top and if not careful the pull handle hits it.  I was concerned that the top piece of tape was cut-down so thin but installed it as it came.  When warmer weather comes, I'm going to try and pop it off and replace the tape. On some other items using the 3m tape, it was suggested to use a heat gun (I was too chicken for this one) or hair dryer to help activate the glue better.  I did that with the window vent shades and it has held up better.  So if/when I redo the tape I will apply heat also.

Supposedly these are the same original equipment pads that came stock on the Tahoe.  I sure hope so as I've been through other sets that have never lasted half the life of these and in comparison these were much more expensive.  However these so far are holding up nice, no real break-in periodneeded and dusting is very minimal.  On a side note the packaging could be better though, as parts were just thrown into a box.

I used this Sand Camouflage Fusion paint as a base coat over the faded blue plastics on my Yamaha Rhino followed by light coats of Brown and Olive camo fusion sprayed thru a mesh bag used as a diffuser. The result was amazing and I couldn't be happier with the outcome, my Rhino has taken on the appearance of a mini-Humvee. I did all the metal work as well as the plastics. After curing the paint has become durable, scratch and chip resistant. Any touchups if needed should be very simple. These paints are truly Ultra-Flat as described and are highly recommended.

The transfer paper stuck to the decal. It was extremely difficult to separate the transfer tape from the backing. At first, I thought this piece was a goner since the paper stuck the decal, meaning I wouldn't have been able to apply to my car window since it would have been the fuzzy, non-sticky paper left over.  I attached some images to show exactly what I mean.  After about 20 - 30 minutes of patience and use of a razor blade and some thumb tacks, I was able to successfully separate the halves.Never in my experience with vinyl decals has it been this difficult. This was either cut improperly or rushed.

Wanted to get rid of stupid circuit boards that plagued 88-98 c1500s.  Almost bought cheaper ones but most reviews said they didn't fit quite right. Spent a little more for these and glad I did! The review were pretty spot on. They look great almost a stock look but way more modern and a very crisp clean red!  The back up light window is way better too. The resistors work great the lights blink regular speed. Waiting to see what happens when putting front led turn signals in. Hope the front resistors will keep me from needing a new flasher. We'll see! Also hope these last a while.

Absolutely perfect!  I only needed the rubber insert that fell apart allowing my old lock button to fall out.  The fob came apart and it was just a few seconds to install the rubber insert into my original remote to restore it to "like new".  Five bucks and free shipping arrived in one day!  Highly recommended!This is only the empty case with rubber insert, no electronic components or remote control circuitry are included.

I was very impressed by the quality of this.  I was afraid it might end up feeling cheap or not well protected.  Some people even said the waist was loose on them but I found the cinch straps located at all parts of the jacket helped tighten those areas.  The liner is very warm inside and the armor turned out to be much higher quality and harder material than I expected.  I'm very happy with this.

This is insanely bright and can not use it for daily commute. I had to install way below the headlight and turn it slightly downwards towards the road to keep it on. Still its very bright and will blind opposite traffic in local streetsLook at the pics. The one at bottom is senlips. The top one is another brand which is a bright as this one. This is very bright despite mounting few inches above ground.This is a daylight photo. Will get the night pictures when I get a chance to use it. Can not turn the lights on in the city roads.

Very fast shipping. Installed it a day later. The kit is complete it has everything you need really. At first it seems like it doesn't fit. It seems like if you force it in place you may damage your MAF but that isn't the case. This kit does take some muscle to get it on otherwise you will think you need to cut one of the end a little shorter, but dont!As for gains, it's too early to tell. I will update the review soon.

This fits my 1999 Buick regal. It can with sticky tabs and unfortunately they didn't stick when I was placing the mirror over my old oneI bought my own separate glass mounting tape and it is working just fine.Also it has some sort of sticky tab on the back of the glass;which I assume, is so you can detact which glass goes on the driver or passenger side mirror. I tried scraping it off but it budge.

It was very easy to install. Only took about 15 minutes. It is rather small, but that's one of the reasons that I bought it. I wish that it had an adjustment to change the angle of the windshield without having to also change the height, which is critical. Having said that, though, it works great up to about 45 or so, then air does start swirling in around the windshield. I have had the bike up to 75 mph without any movement or vibrations and it kept the bugs off me quite well. I liked it, but now I'm wishing that it was a couple of inches bigger. Good price, though.

Not as bright as I thought, very easy to install, when I turn on my fog lights alone it halfway turns on my headlights and illuminates high beam indicator in the dash (picture 1&3). While normal head lights are on alone they work fine (pic5) but when I select fog lights the high beams turn on(pic2&4). While only using high beams the light beam comming from lights is useless because it creates a circle of light not letting you see what's directly in front of you(pic2). Wouldn't recommend

Showed up in perfect condition. Took my husband about 45mins to install. Hardest part was getting the mounting plate/bracket to slide through and try to not lose it. My husband was 258lbs and it does not flex.

It looks well built. The casting seems better quality than the similarly built OEM brand unit. I had my doubts it was going to be getting the same product (OEM) under a different name but that isn't case. Also the socket doesn't get stuck in it.There is a broken OEM wrench on the left and the assemacher on the right of the picture.

It's a pretty versatile charger. 110 or 240 volt adaptable. It can change output from 8, 12, or 16 amps by just shaking the unit. I tried it with a regular 110v socket, and 240v (14-50 plug). The adapters and unit worked fine. I also found a 110v 20amp adapter for that connection. Overall it's lightweight and the LED screen and lights tell you all you need to know. I got it all to fit in a small bag. Should be fine for traveling. It has a hole on the handle for a lock. I use mine a Ford C-Max.

I've been using Husky Liners in all my vehicles for 15 years, and have never been disappointed in the quality and durability of their products. I still have the original husky liners I bought in 2002 for my old truck that is used on the farm now and they have not let me down. I currently have a set in my 14 ram and just purchased this set for my wife's 16 Durango. I suggest to anyone looking for a product that will help prevent stains from everyday use and of course spills and what not from our kids.  This kit includes the front driver and passenger and the second row floor liners.

If you put the effort in, the reward is great. I find that "Blitz" puts the best protection on a corrected finish for the money than any product that I've tried and I've tried a lot to include Wolfgang 3.0, which is good but pricey. It does require work and a corrected surface. The hyperbolic finish holds longer than all others. During the "Love Bug" season it performed great. Power wash and it still beads,and the " bugs" in Texas this year were extremely bad Once again, the finish does need to be corrected before hand.

I compared the original Toyota Denso 17801-46080 with this Mann MA 1125 filter (see pictures under Customer Images).  They are both solidly built filters and the Mann was an exact fit to replace the 17801-46080.  The filter material feels the same and is just as thick and dense as the OEM material, even down to the 17 individual pleats.  I'd gladly save $8 or so buying this filter again as it's nearly identical to the OEM Denso.  As mentioned in another review, my filter was also made in Israel.  I don't think you can go wrong with this quality filter.

I would give these 5 stars if the output was just a little brighter. Great light and color i would just like to see them a little brighter but they put a great beam on the road and are much better than the OEM.

Purchased this to correct a sticking key, slightly challenging to insert key notches to match old cylinder. And the entire process of separating the key lock mechanism and the cylinder requires some study (and by studying I mean watching videos on YouTube).The documentation was helpful and the part completely corrected the problem. Anyone having a stuck key and driving an Chevy Equinox/Saturn/GM mini-suv, get this, don't bother with WD40 or white lithium.

It worked very well. I am attaching a collage of 5 photos and will be referencing the photos by the unique numbers that each photo was labelled with.1) The stock photo is somewhat deceiving as it makes you think the clay fills the nice container it is shipped in. Photo #1 shows the clay in the plastic wrap is it arrived, and photo #2 a clay ball after I worked with it. The amount of clay is sufficient to work with, I am not complaining about that, just the photo makes you think you get a lot more. The container itself is very nice for storage. The paint clay I used before is Mother's clay - love the product - but I had to come up with a plastic container of my own. A tip on storage: before storing the clay ball in the container wet the outside of the clay ball with Griot's Speed Shine or any other detailing spray. This makes the clay easier to take out the next time as it sticks less to the container.2) Photos #4 and #5 show the windshield glass before and after. As you can see the difference is significant, and it was fairly easy to get it that clean. All glass surfaces took no more than 20 minutes and that included taking photos for this review. The clay removed water stains as well as some non-bird droppings (I think dragonfly or some other insect) which are hard to remove with just soap and water.3) Photo #3 shows the trick that allows me to reach the glass that it too far away for me to reach by hand. I am fairly short so reaching the middle of the sunroof and the middle of my windshield is not possible for me without a stepping stool. I found that it was a lot easier to to put the clay ball under a triangle-shaped Glass Reach and Clean Tool and use it to rub the clay ball on the glass that I could not reach.The clay worked well to remove debris, but it was fairly sticky and my hands were slightly blue when I finished. I was able to remove the residue from my hands using Griot's Speed Shine followed by a vigorous washing with soap.Thumbs up overall!Ali Julia review

If you're looking to make a sweet looking and well functioning vehicle on a budget that can do things at night, this is the light bar for you. I installed this in under an hour and when I hit that rocker switch to turn it on, I went blind from inside my cab (As I was parked in a garage facing a white wall). This light for being only 20" puts out the same amount of light as my buddy's 55" bar and cost under $30. This is a great deal and I am trying to find where I can mount another one. The light from this bar, when angled correctly, easily extends out to 200 yards and out to 100 yards, it still is as bright as day light. I have run this for hours (longest period being 4 hours continuous) and not one light has gone out. Also, I would say it is 100% water proof. I have power washed my truck, sent it through puddles that have soaked the entire truck, and driven in temperatures down to -30 degrees in a snowstorm. This bar looks great and works great. Would highly suggest getting.

The factory lug nuts that came with my Jeep Wrangler looked nice - until the stainless steel cladding came off after repeated abuse from tire shops with impact wrenches.  I thought I could save money and buy some cheap one-piece lug nuts at a mega-discount store chain.  I was sadly mistaken.  The replacement nuts had two problems.First, the thread size of the "cheap lugs" was correct but the wrench size was different.  This meant that my factory lug wrench was no good.  Fortunately when I got a flat, I had tools and was OK.And the cheap lug nuts peeled, chipped, and worst of all, rusted badly.  A short time after they were first installed I noticed the chrome was peeling off.  A couple rain storms later, the cheap lug nuts were rusty!I should have known better.  I worked in a wheel shop that used nothing but McGard lug nuts.  In the whole time I worked there I never saw anyone bring them back for any reason.  We saw our customers for tire rotations and new tires.  The lug nuts were always like new.So I took a lesson from my ancient experience and bought McGard.  They've been on the Jeep for months and still look new.  Best of all, the no rust, and my factory lug wrench fits!

This actually works pretty darn well in clearing up the yellowing and cloudiness on headlights, but don't expect it to get rid of micro scratches that become very evident when you turn on the headlights.If you want the most thorough headlight restoration you want to use the wet sanding method. Plenty of Youtube how to videos out there on this method, check it out.

I purchased these for my 99' Z71 Silverado. What a great kit with everything you need to change out all your rotors and pads. The kit includes new Stainless Steel Slide Clips, High Temp Grease, Caliper Slide Boots and Inner Bushings, and everything else needed. The Rotors are labeled for where they go and the instructions are written in english and are easy to follow. I had no issues installing everything. It took me a weekend to do all 4 wheels.The braking is smooth and of better performance than OEM IMO. I am very happy with the results. The pads do smell for the first several drives you make, but soon stop. There is a brake-in procedure for the pads that involves hard braking from 40 mph to 0 mph, 5 times in a row without cooling then followed by 25 mph to 0 mph hard braking, 5 times in a row allowing for cooling down in-between. My pedal is a bit softer after the install and the braking is solid and smooth.To top it all off, you get a free hat with the kit. And not just a stupid hat that you wouldn't want to wear, but rather a very nice looking one that I am wearing all the time. It fits Great Too!

So far it seems to be okay!  The install was a bit more difficult that originally thought but that was because I got cheap and didn't want to buy a bigger drill bit!  I figured I could use a round file the rest of the way!  Well, I couldn't find the file and so I ended up using the drill bit that was just one size to small and just went through it over and over until it fit.  I used the separate air valve method!  There were some existing holes just behind the mud flaps that I used.  It took about two hours to do one side.  Then I ran out of daylight so the next day I did the other side.  But first I went to buy a right size drill bit. Then i only took me half the time.  You'll have to remove the existing bump stop!  Four this, you will need a 14mm socket with extension so no need to do any cutting or the rubber bump stops.  I gave it 4 stars for now but when I take that long road trip in a few weeks where I'll be carrying a lot of gear in the back over some high mountain passes, I'll see how these work out and will upgrade to 5 stars if it works out well.I took some photos of how it looks and where I mounted the valve stems but I guess there is no way to upload them on a review.  Oh well!Update:  21 NOV, 2014:  Took the van with the air bags on a 1000 mile road trip.  On the last half of the trip, we had about 600-700 lbs, maybe more loaded in the rear with the bags inflated to about 30 PSI.  The bags kept the van from sagging all the way down like the last time we carried that much weight.  You can still notice it dropped but not a significant drop.  With the extra weight, the van still handled okay coming down mountain passes and when we hit small bumps.Overall, these are a very inexpensive way to add carrying capacity to a minivan.  Well worth the purchase and not too difficult to install!

Love this wax! Goes on really well and smooth, i hand wax my truck and my wifes car and can do them both in about 45 minutes, thats taking my time. I also love that you can wax with water still on the vehicle, saves time not having to dry you car or truck. Smells great, they say it smells like bananas but it smells like monster energy drink to me.

This tool is not well finished.  The handles are well constructed, it has good strength, but the actual business part of the pliers did not have close to a proper grind.  The jaws of the pliers are dull and won't grab a cv clamp at all.  Perhaps it's just the pair I received, but either way that's some really poor quality control.  I've bought ABN tools before and had success, but this one misses the mark by a mile.  I've included some photos.  The first two pictures is of the ABN tool, notice the lack of proper grind on the jaws.  The other photo (the one with the tan background) is the same tool from a different manufacturer that's roughly $10 more than the ABN pliers.  Check out the nice finish and excellent grind on them.  That's what should be on the ABN pair, but is not.  So if you buy these, check out the jaws carefully.

Amazing product, I had no idea it would look even as close to as good as it turned out on my car. The tint was a little hard to work with but it held up well and ads a unique theme to my car. a downside is that sometimes when light hits the tint if you have your headlights tinted people may think that your headlights are on when they aren't, but i just think its funny so i have no problem with it at all. if you have large headlights like mine you may need two rolls of tint as i had exactly what i needed, i had zero tint left over. but the cost is definitely worth it.

They work, but wire colors are wrong vs Bosch for 2$ less & correct. These have Red wire for ground, BLK +, & so on. I pulled & moved all pigtails to match standard Bosch codes in everything. Probably fine for reverse polarity imports, but red going to my grounding bar & black to power, I'd forget in a month & short out entire system. My mistake not ordering Bosch, they admit colors aren't standard.

First thing I noticed when I open d thenpackage was how cheap the packaging was.  But second I noticed how cheap of a job they did soldering the wires to the circuit board and that there is little to no protection on the wiring from pulling out the circuit board connection.  I realize this is a pretty cheap light but I would have paid a bit extra for better quality craftsmanship.

Even if you dont, they provide detailed instructions on how to install, and provide everything needed.Two little problems I had. The bottom right bracket needed raised just slightly. If you're capable of installing this fan then you're capable of doing a quick measurement and punching out a couple new holes on the fan housing. Not a big deal. The other more significant problem that I had was that the fan switch and my aftermarket coolant sensor were touching in the adapter housing. Screwing the jeep sensor in broke the fan switch. A quick call to Derale customer support and they shipped out a new adapter on the same day with a special switch specific to my jeep. That kind of customer service alone is worth 5 stars! For the time being I just turned the fan on manually using a toggle switch.The video says it all. Now that everything is wired up properly, it kicks on a little above the 210 mark, and brings it down to about 185, right in the range where my jeep is designed to run. I don't know the exact speed but the CFM is ridiculous. Also lost about 6lbs getting rid of the stock fan setup, as well as gaining back the force from the pulley that drove the fan. All-in-all I couldn't be happier with my purchase!Total stars for product and customer service? 10!

I used this cap in conjuction with my Motive power bleeder. I was amazed how well It seals to the master cylinder and the quick connect fitting makes it so easy to use. I simply uses a 1/4" female Quick connect fitting from the home improvement store and attached it to the threaded fitting on the Motive hose. Pricey, but so worth it! I used it on my 07 Tundra and 13 Rav4 successfully.

I am having to modify these, they do not fit my 2006 F250 properly and the lower OEM bolt will not pass through the aftermarket bracket without damage to the threads and subsequent damage to the captured nut.the bracket hits the back of the OEM mount before the holes line up and the elongated bolt hole in the aftermarket bracket just isn't offset or long enough to compensate for the interference.it's better than starting from scratch,  but they need to retest fit these and see where they lost tolerance  so it can be a truly bolt on item

I purchased the Deltran Battery Tender 022-0150-DL-WH 800, as a replacement for a 20+ year-old trickle charger that recently failed. Wow, has this technology improved in the past 2 decades!This new unit was "permanently" attached to the battery terminals using the included eyelet/ring connectors.While the vehicle is not left outdoors, the fact that it is waterproof is a plus, since I don't have to worry about moisture when cleaning the engine.Also, with my old trickle charger, I would plug it in, overnight, then unplug it in the morning, so as not to overcharge it. The "float mode" feature on the new one means I can plug it in, and forget it; especially during the winter months.I used "super" Velcro to attach it inside the engine compartment, in close proximity to the battery (see photo). I didn't care to drill any new holes, so plan to give this a shot for a while. If this doesn't work, sufficiently, I may also consider securing it with a long zip tie.This unit is .8 amps, vs the 1.25 amps on my old trickle charger, but given the convenience of the LED charging indicator light (I can even view it through the louvers on my hood!), and sophisticated 3-step charging system, I'm fine with the lower ampere rating.Notes:1. The directions state the LED indicator light is AMBER, when charging. It's RED.2. When charging, the AM radios on AC in our home, buzz. If I unplug the battery tender, the buzzing stops.

This hinge is BEEFY.  It is a drastic improvement over the stock hinges.  This will be quite evident when you take them off.  I would say that the 32" BFG MTs that I had on my tire carrier were pushing the weight limit of the stock hinges.  I picked this up in preparation for moving to a much heavier 35" tire and I'm definitely glad I did.  I feel much more confident in this hinge.  Installation was very straightforward and quite simple.  Total time to remove old carrier and install this was less than an hour.I actually purchased this with the tire carrier, but since I have only installed the hinge (used stock carrier), I'm only giving my opinion on the hinge.  I will review that item separately after it s installed when I move to larger tires.Edit: I would also mention that it does come with the nice Teraflex shield emblem that is shown in the product pictures.  I just have not put it on the hinge.

I bought this item for my 2010 VStar 950. I didn't use the mounting bracket that came with it, I used my existing luggage rack as a stable platform, it was plenty strong enough for me to sit on (I'm 200'lbs) so I know it'll take the 20 or 30 lbs that will end up going in this thing.I also lined it with some automotive grade carpeting to give it some interior strength against sharp items inside cracking the shell or scratching my helmet or anything else in it.Overall I'm very pleased with the item so far. Will update this review once I've used it for a while.___________________6+ months of use report.Ok so I've been using this trunk for almost 6 months and I've still very pleased. I've taken a couple of long distance (5 day) trips and its been great. holds everything I need for long trips and keeps my "essentials" handy around town.Rick

Good quality wire. Thick and ridged insulation jacket to ease installation. I've purchased similar cheap wire the insulation is much cheaper. This leads to easy tears and short circuiting. Not with this wire.The length sold is accurate to what is shipped on the individual spools. You won't be shorted on wire or disappointed with quality.

Excellent, better than expected. Installed on a couple fogs completely dry with no heat. no issues at all. All my other installs required heat and spray. this was very easy tint to work with. Just make sure you cut a 6" square for each fog, so you have room to pull and grab without getting fingerprints under it. NOTE that this tint has BOTH a under peel layer, and also a top peel layer after you are done working it.

Vehicle:  2005 Mazda RX8First and foremost, change your cabin air filter @ a minimum every two years.  If you park close to trees or underneath trees a lot then I recommend every year.  They are not so expensive that they can't be changed annually (in the spring before the pollen starts to fall) that way you're sniffing good clean air throughout the remainder of the year.  Just my two cents.  I posted a picture of what happens when you neglect to change the cabin air filter.  If you suffer from allergies and you don't change this filter then you are doing yourself an injustice.  Also, if you transport pets in your vehicle it clogs the filters faster b/c of their hair and dander (I don't like pets so no problem for me).Anyway, this WIX filter seems to be of good quality and according to the box it filters out all the nasty things that we don't like to breathe in.  Of course the airflow through the vents increased b/c now there are nice clean filters installed.  Buy with confidence if you trust the WIX brand; if not, buy something else that you prefer.  Thanks for reading and I hope this review helps you make a decision (positive or negative).

The BESTEK 200W Cup Inverter 12V DC to 110V AC Power Inverter looks really nice. All exterior surfaces have a glossy finish. It gives a feel of a solid product, not like many products nowadays that look cheap.  The one I have has a different graphics design. Instead of ocean waves, I got American flag.  See picture. It sits in my cars cup holder comfortably. A detachable cable connects the inverter to the cigarette lighter socket of the car. Now I have loads of options. Among them, there are two 110V AC sockets (for laptop PC and another device), two USB sockets to charge a smart phone and a tablet PC at the same time. It even comes with a cigarette lighter socket, perhaps for a GPS device that needs it for power. There is an LED indicator for power (green) and fault (red). There is also a power button built-in, all within easy reach of my fingers.I used to have a block shaped inverter in my car. There was really not a good way to hide it, except putting it in the glove box when not in use. Now this cleverly designed inverter hides very well. I have two cup holders in tandem. This one occupies only one. I put away the cable when I don't use the inverter. Really cool. I am very happy with the product.

'05 EJ20.  I also replaced the shift linkage joint because the bushings were gone.  Between the two replacements, there is no more shifter wobble when not in gear, the shifts are clean and tight.  LOVE IT.  Don't cut that big bushing in half to fit it in!  With a little silicone spray and creative use of c-clamps you can pop that sucker in without butchering it like some people do (you can also push it in by using a large fender washer on one end and a slightly smaller one on the other, put an all-thread bolt through the middle and tighten the nut until is pops the bushing in.  It is definitely easier to work in that area when you've got the axle and exhaust out of the way for a clutch job!

These relays were meant to go with the H84709001 harnesses. I run 3 of them on my project car. I've had no problems with them and they've been installed for about a year. The metal mounting tab is nice too. It allowed me to screw all 3 relays next to each other for a clean install.

These are fantastic! Sturdy and well made. Holes lined up perfect with my 2007 Jeep Wrangler Sahara Unlimited. The nutserts are much better than nut and bolt mounting. Had to buy the smittybuilt 2834 black nutsert tool set, but worth it in the end. Was going to spray them with bed liner to match my hood, but the factory finish on them almost matched my hood, so put them on as is.

I need it to prevent my steering wheel starts to peeling, due to i sweat heavily when I train at gym. And the SW became slippery, that's the dangerous part, i needed to add some grip.  So i decided to buy a nice SW cover, i search and only found low quality plastic covers, yes, they're cheap, but they looks awful and you get what you pay for, you know "buy cheap, buy twice".  This Vitodeco's cover give me the extra grip i was looking for, and struggle less than a minute to install it, and looks really nice.  Let the pictures speak by themselves.

Factory Effex quality, genuine Yamaha motor. Fits to size. 510 205 Large fit perfectly. Mine also was one with the metal rivets on the front pouch and I really like that it is a sewn on tag. The hood does have the Factory Effex logo ribbon around the neck which is awesome too. I wore it for a ride recently in 60* weather here in the PNW, stayed plenty warm the whole time.

Fit 97 accord, a tiny bit longer than the oem lug nuts but that doesn't bother me. I bought two different gorilla style lock nuts. If you guys are wondering what wheels these are. These are 02 accord special edition wheels. From what I know, only 02 accord special edition came with these wheels.

Fit perfectly on the flange that joins Dynatech's long tube headers to meet high flow cats. Check your instructional manual, it will clearly state 2.5 OR 3.0 inch. I called Dynatech to order replacements caused I goofed on the initial install. They quoted me $55 + "freight" shipping? If you call car part places, these are vehicle specific, which means you CANNOT match them up without a part number that literally does not exist.

I mostly like this mount but it doesn't always fit.Not knowing how well this component would fit, I also bought the RAM Brake / Clutch Reservoir Base&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Ram-Mount-Motorcycle-Brake-Clutch-Reservoir-Base-with-1-Inch-Ball/dp/B0012TT8BK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Ram Mount Motorcycle Brake/Clutch Reservoir Base with 1-Inch Ball</a>&nbsp;and I'm glad I did.  This mount did not fit on my mirror next to the brake reservoir.  Well, technically it did fit but there wasn't enough clearance to get a wrench on the nut to tighten it down appropriately.  On the non reservoir side, the mount fits nicely on my mirror mount.  Now, I have mounts on both sides, just of different types!The picture on the right side of the handlebar shows the nice fit.I have included the picture of this mount on the non fitting left side handlebar, next to the brake reservoir.  It looks like it fits but I was unable to tighten the mirror bolt due to lack of clearance with the mount attached.

VERY IMPORTANT!You must replace your flywheel with this clutch, Subaru OEM flywheels can not be resurfaced. The clutch disc will hit your flywheel bolts and make a terrible scratching/grinding noise. I'd recommend getting a lightened flywheel while you're at it. Exedy makes this in a kit, but I ended up choosing a different one.In the instructions included with this kit, it does not say to replace the flywheel, it says to resurface, please learn from my mistake, I had to pull my engine a second time.This clutch disc center protrudes from the friction surface greatly, but I did call Exedy to confirm this is the correct part.I will update the review when I get it back installed, I just don't want people to make the same mistake I did.

Bought this back on Feb. 2011 for my Hyundai Sonata. The blade has age of close to 4 1/2 years. I parked my car outside. I live around Chicago area. So I get everything from snow, rain, wind, sun, bugs, bird drops. The blade still works but with minor streaking where small tear on the silicone blade itself. There is a little rust on the blade arm itself. For most people, it should lasts more than 5 years especially if parked car inside garage. Overall, it was a great blade to owned. Added a few pictures of it.

These fit awesome. They are tight, and feel like a part of the vehicle. I installed them on my grandparents 2013, and will be buying another set for my grandmas jeep for mothers day.Took about 45 minutes to do, including finding the tools (13Mm and allen key) losing a bolt down the side panel, and doing joking about with my grandpa.READ - when taking the lower (horizontal) bolt out, BE CAREFUL anddont drop it down. It seemsto stop halfway, but a super pain.I have read sometimes jeep manufacturers sometimesdont align the body 100% so your bolts may be tighter than should be. Line it up, andpower through it!100%, 10/10 would buy again.Please thumbs up if this post helped!

- PROS: It works! Looks durable.- CONS: Minor scratches. Need a drilling work if your metal key part is not T-shaped.My 2004 RX car key was falling apart, hence I ordered this.Upon opening the package, I found the product has lots of scratches (see attachments). I reached out to the seller and this is the response I got the next day: "[...] I understand the issue. The key shells often get scratched up during shipping. There isn't much that we can do to prevent it without raising the price of the product significantly. [...] All I can recommend is that you can sand it smooth with some high grit sand paper (800 - 2000 grit) or a nail file."The reply was timely and polite. I was disappointed that a new product would have so many scratches, but I see the seller's point that it's to keep the cost down.Just like one of other reviewers, I found my key was not T-shaped after I wrenched / shattered open the plastic fob. I drilled a hole and used the screw from the original fob to put the metal part in place.I have been using it for a week now and it works well. It looks durable. I expect it to last a few years.

First of all, I just want to point out that it is stupid for some of the other reviewers to blame the product for not sticking because they didn't know how to properly prepare the surfaces for optimal adhesion. Or to blame the magnets because they didn't know how to measure for proper alignment. This product is sound in both concept and execution. Those other reviewers who claimed to have had installation issues are for lack of a better word, stupid. It's not the product's or the designer's fault that they lack common sense.I bought these because they don't actually make the type of clear cover for my Lexus where I can just replace the red cover for the front door courtesy lights. Having these at the stock location would be ideal, but these are great alternative. BTW, I found other listings on Amazon for brown, tan, and beige color units to match the color of your interior. So black is not the only choice.I had the location on my Lexus' door already picked out and made sure I had clearance between the door and seats before I even placed the order for these. And when I received my units, I tested them for proper functionality and to test the limits of the magnets' range. I found that I can turn the units on and off with the magnets as far away as an inch. Also for best results, it is better to align the magnets not under the spot where it shows "Sensor", but at the far edge of the unit (opposite side of the lens).Preparation of the surfaces is very important. If you had ever detailed your car in the past with Armor-All type products, I can pretty much guarantee that there is no double-sided tape on earth that will stick well to it. So I cleaned my door panels with Windex first followed by rubbing alcohol. Same thing for the door sill as well. That striped off all the Armor-All. Both my lights and magnets now have death-grip like adhesion to their respective surfaces. I though to myself I may regret this if I ever want to remove these in the future for any reason. But for the time being, they look pimp as hell. Best thing of all, both of my units function beautifully on the first try.These are great products. I've gotten many compliments for these. Don't be like the other idiots. Do your homework. Measure, clean, and mock up before you stick. Then you won't have any problems.Update 09/03/2016:The Lexus logo is still shining bright and the adhesive is still holding strong. There is not any bit of wiggle at all, not even while I was trying to pry open the battery door. I did have to replace the batteries twice already during the past 6 months. Each set of fresh AAAs seem to last about 3 months. Of course less if you open your doors a lot. Anyway, the take away from this, the LEDs still work although consume batteries rather quickly. And that the supplied 3M tape withstood the test of time and the heat from SoCal summer. Still 5 stars!Update 08/12/2017:Several more battery swaps and almost an other year has gone by since my last update. The LEDs are still shinning bright. Oh and guess what else! The supplied 3M double sided tape are still stuck on strong. Still 5 stars!

Don't waste your time. The polished finish looks great, but that's about it. It is not labeled correctly as the  description on Amazon, the TriMax website, and the box say 1,500lbs tongue weight capacity but the product itself says 1,000 pounds. It is loose fitting in the receiver(looser than most), and the adjustment slide is too loose as well. The "security screw" that holds it together was stripped, and the threaded hole is goes into was so rusty I couldn't even clean it out with a pipe cleaner and an air compressor. A heavy tongue trailer will put too much stress on the locking pin in the back for it to hold up. It's a great thought, just a really poor execution. Will drop off at UPS tomorrow to return. I don't think I'll trust my boat on it.

The elastic Fits really tight. The fabric is a little loose which is nice, leaves room for my drivers backrest if it's on. Used it a couple times for light rain. Haven't had the chance to see how it performs in a downpour. not that I prefer to leave my bike out in the rain, but Michigan weather happens sometimes.

OK seriously, you zip tie the case closed KNOWING its damaged and send it to a paying customer thinking it will be fine???!!! WRONG!  The case looks used! Wont close all the way!!Update 11/14/17Though prior review stated why I gave it 2 stars, now I have updated it to 4 stars. Husband tried it on our tires and worked perfectly! He said  he likes it a lot and recommends but beware of a flimsy damaged case!Product seems new and arrived in 2 days per our Prime Membership. If its not cheap material and works fine, may boost up to 3 stars. But due to the case arriving zip tied etc I know its not shipping damage 2 stars!!!!

Great LED light. I installed a pair of these on my 2007.5 Chevy Silverado, and now I can see where I am backing up !!! These things are so bright I feel bad for anyone who is behind me. The color temperature is like a blueish, so they don't match the normal back up color, but it still looks good. Please look at the pictures I added. These lights are very easy to install on the silverado. Took me about 30 minutes to complete.As soon as I get some more money, I am buying more of these.

I used this to seal water out of my house. It really is an amazing product but it also does bubble up and leaves little gaps in the sealing surface. I used this product in black on my truck bed and it's a different product the gray. It even bubbled what while I was mixing it in the can today.  I used gray to seal up my house and I found after three full kits ($140 each) that the third coat is a lighter gray so it doesn't completely color match. I have to stop because I'm done, I sealed it and this is getting expensive even though the color doesn't match I have to move forward with my life.  Other people have talked about the bubbles I did experience it with the gray and it really sucks but overall it is waterproof at the very least it restricts the amount of water that comes in in my basement. This was used for concrete. The bubbles make me wonder if it could let water in.We did have a good rain after the first coats. NOT A DROP made it into my home.  Compare that to the $3000 estimates I got from foundation repair specialists. Add in my labor...  well worth doing.

I've been using this stuff as a replacement for my old favorite "The Wax Shop" wax. It's almost as good - even in sunlight but you need to work in smaller areas. Leaves a finish that allows microfiber towels to just slide off. Super easy to apply and a bottle lasts a lifetime NT time. Used on all my cars (Nissan GT-R, BMW 135i and Nissan Juke Nismo RS). Bought the 6-pack and shared with neighbors. They love the stuff and they all have black cars. Truly a great product.

I don't understand the horrible reviews. All saying it doesn't fit. Of course it doesn't fit like factory it's an AFTERMARKET PART. I don't know bout everybody else but 95% of the parts,lights,bumpers,tires etc etc that I've put on my jeep haven't gone on without some kind of issue. I mean yes it was a royal pain in the behind  to put it on but that's the joy of owning a jeep. You make it your own. Unless you want your jk to look like everyone else's. The fitment is not the best. But it's not a factory part. You have to be careful with the finish. It's matte black why buy it if you're not gonna take care of it. You have to mess with the temperature sensor. Who hasn't messed with stuff on their jeep??? I bought one on Amazon it didn't fit right they sent me another it fit better. Amazon is awesome. Once on the grill looks mean as hell. I haven't bumped into one single jeep owner who hasn't told me how dope that grill is. Oh one thing no one mentioned is the fact that one on its sturdy as hell AND it also improves wind resistance. And it looks awesome. If you're a true jeep enthusiast you will appreciate this item. If you're just a jeep club guy who doesn't like change don't buy it. Simple. Oh and I also bought another one to paint it body color, and I'm sure once I put that one on all those jeep club guys at the dealership will also tell me how dope it is. But hey it's up to you it's your jeep make it your own. You have any issues amazon will help if not rugged ridge is an amazing company with excellent customer service. Took me a couple tries to get it on right but I'm glad I did cuz it looks awesome on my jeep!

I used this paint on a 1/5 scale Redcat Racing Rampage MT body and one can covered virtually the entire body solidly behind Duratrax Pearl White (Pearl White is translucent), but holding it up to the sun I still saw some light.  Started using a second can but didn't have to use the whole thing.  The quantity inside these cans are better than other brands.  Just spray horizontally and not in a downward angle to avoid droplets of paint ruining your good paint job.  Great paint!

Excellent product. It has an aluminum frame with a steel center support that is 2" OD steel tube powder coated gray. Assembly was easy. Put the 2 U shaped aluminum pieces on first that hold the two halves together and get the bolts started. Then put the 4 bolts that attach the two sides to the steel tube and and start the nuts on the bolts. Then tighten up the bolts in the u channel and finally tighten the bolts attaching it to the steel center support. It only weighs about 20 to 22 lbs. The U channel pieces do have slightly sharp edges so if you have a file or some sand paper I filed the edges smooth before assembly. It comes with the 5/8 hitch pin. The only reasons for the 4 stars is that the description describes an "anti-wobble" but there is nothing to stop wobbling. So if it's a concern pick up an anti wobble device for 13 to 20 dollars. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DOJGD2M/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1And secondly because of the rough edges the two U channel pieces. I would give 4 1/2 stars because for the money this is excellent. Aluminum so no rusting. No powder coated steel frame that will ultimately chip, scratch and rust. If the description didn't mention anti-wobble technology It would be 5 stars.My application was a little custom. It's on a dune buggy/sand rail. I also added the 1/4" eye bolts around perimeter. I'm well aware that doing so voids any kind of warranty and probably lowers it's maximum capacity by some small percentage. Not a concern for me. Just need to be able to hold a couple gas cans, maybe a lunch type cooler or something.

The item broke with first use. I needed this tool to remove the steering from my Camaro project. Upon tightening the wing nut, one end broke off. The edge was very jagged and I had to use channel-locks to remove it. Amazon and the vendor graciously accepted the return and refund.

Is it just me or is Amazon sending out old stock? The unit I got looks like it was made in the mid 90s. The packaging and the module has the old DEI logo with 1994 date stamp.Im sure the module design hasn't changed since then but Im a bit weary about installing something that has been sitting in storage for over 2 decades, potentially causing issues.This might be a non-issue but can anyone chime in? Thanks.

1st set was defective, they were "strobing" like. Not the fast flash, but a flicker, both sides. And they both would stop working whenever they wanted too. This includes the amber led as well. Was odd, they worked fine for one day. Tried in my other vehicle and results were the same.Contacted seller for a replacement. That was the mistake, took 5-7 days. You are better off just contacting Amazon for a return. New set working fine 3 days in so far. Love them!All pictures are the with only the same brand LED's installed, Switchbacks,  194''s in the marker lights (amber) and CCFL halos on my driving lights. All super bright!Update,  replacement bulbs received, working perfect!

Updated review on paint chipping in many locations. The  design of the bull bar and the light assembly. However when using the bolts that it came with washers, lock washers and nuts. When tightening up, I found that it will only get so tight and the bull bar itself still moves. I tried to tighten it up more and no luck. I had to use my own bolts, lock washers and nut to secure it tighter and to not move. I've got 2 complaints  that I have with it, now remember this is really not to pull, push and etc with this bull bar. It's more for looks I believe. I did install the light also with mine and it's very bright, just getting the angle so I don't blind anyone and use it when I need it. I just wish that the company would send better installment gadgets to put it together and make it solid. Also maybe a better primer so chipping doesn't occur . I can only hope that this company will read this and other reviews to make this a better product which I believe they can do better and improve to make customers happy such as myself and anyone else wanting to buy there products. Paint chipping away. So better hardware and go back to the original primer to prevent chipping

Remember when you used to just buy wiper blades and slide them in for $5? I miss those days. Now you have to replace the whole wiper and its holder - and these especially are crap. Ordered the correct drivers side blade for my 2017 explorer listed in my book, the correct blade arrived arrording to the part numbers on the package, but the included adapters were wrong! I had to grind off tabs that were not supposed to be there. $17 for a wiper blade that doesnt even fit. SMHIt tells me to stay away from Bosh. They aren't what they used to be.

This stuff is AWESOME! Just bought the car...the top was a bit dull, and didn't repel water. Cleaned with Meguiars Convertible top cleaner and then used this to protect.  It's amazing how great the top looks now!  I did cover my windshield to protect from overspray, and the overspray does spot windows.  But great product!

These LEDs were perfect and fit the 2017 Toyota Tundra SR5 TRD Off-road Crewmax. Used for the map lights but will also use them for the dome. Notice the difference in my uploaded pictures. The stock bulbs have a urine stain glow where as the JDM ASTAR LEDs have a have a very nice white emitting light.

Has a really good look and texture for a vinyl. Makes it look just like carbon fiber. The product is easy to work with. It's amazing how many times you can pull and reset it without it losing its look. Even though it got all crinkled up, a little heat returns it to new. As with all vinyls, there can be pull back and lift off If you over stretch it past about 30% or work on curves that are way to deep. But, if you're sensible about its use it'll lay flat and turn out great.

Fixed my issue on my 2001 f250 extended cab rear door. After receiving the kit,  it did not come with any instructions. So after trial and error and some YouTube videos I was able to figure it out. As far as sliding over the cable it wasn't going to happen.  Best thing I found was to use a razor and trim the black cover off around the cable so it would slide into the clip. Works perfect.  One other thing,  one of the clips is different than the rest, that one goes on the top latch.

I had tried several other products to clean the whitewalls on a 2004 Road King Classic with no success (Simple Green, Comet, Bleche-Wite new formula, Soft Scrub). I was to the point where I was trying to convince my wife that I needed new tires, I didn't win that one. I bought this along along with some interior vinyl paint thinking I would try one last product to clean the whitewalls or I was going to go with a DIY restoration of the whitewalls (not an approach I was looking forward to). Brown truck delivered the package and I thought I'd try the Duragloss product on a small portion of the rear tire. Sprayed it on, waited a couple of minutes, and took a stiff bristled brush to the area I had sprayed. After a rinse with water, I was astonished by the outcome. The whitewalls came clean to where I was happy. The bike was bought used and the previous owner had not cleaned the whitewalls in some time. That along with a 1500 mile ride with brake dust and some parts in rain made the whitewalls very stained. This cleaner is the best I've found and would recommend it to anyone looking to clean some stubborn whitewalls.

Okay, I was so excited to find this grill at a reasonable cost.  I literally jumped up and down at the chance to get it.  At any rate it is great!  I love the way it looks!  So we had an estimated delivery date.  The delivery was delayed by one day in transit.  No fault to the seller, it was just one of those things that happens.  We luckily received it just before we were leaving for a trip.  So we immediately put this grill to the test with over 500 miles during the weekend and some pretty extreme off-roading thrown in.  I could not be happier with how it performed and survived the weekend.  The product was well packaged and received with no damage.  The grill comes with clips!  This is GREAT!  They are just the lower clips, but they are metal and they are new.  This is great as anyone that has removed a grill and messed with the clips will understand.  The install took my husband about 20 to 30 minutes.  He has done this a few times so this was not a hard thing for him.  We found that it looks great and that the only thing that we would add is a piece of rubber along the top (an air dam type thing) as there is a slight gap between the grill and the hood.  That being said this in no way was an issue and the grill stayed in place throughout our adventures.  Once installed it is amazing how much it changes the look of your rig.  She definitely look meaner now.  The grill seems to be pretty heavy duty without being heavy in weight or lacking in durability.  It was an easy install and has performed exactly as we wanted it to.  So far we are thrilled with the look and have had zero issues with the grill.  It is an attention getter for sure and has been a conversation starter.  We are quite happy with it and for the cost this is an amazing deal!We received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  We hope that you find the information provided in the review useful in your purchase considerations.  We highly recommend this grill for the cost and the durability we have experienced.

Real deal. I had the single disc PeeWee Herman horn on my big 1,700cc beast. I am now a  grown man. It's loud and proud. Make sure you get the wiring kit and properly hook it up to the battery and relay or you may get toast on a motorcycle

Bought these for my 2001 Nissan Pathfinder. I am on the fence...1- They are cheap for a reason. Materials and finish of bulbs is ok, not great and the lens cracked while i was installing them despite being VERY careful. I knew about this problem through other reviews so i was prepared for it.2- The installation instructions were VERY VAGUE. They do not tell you that the bulb skirt comes off with a twist to allow the weather seal to slip over the bulb for original style fitment.3- The bulbs have a fan due to the amount of heat they create which is odd, given its a LED, but this creates issues when trying to secure the bulb with the rubber seal in place.4- You can not adjust beams with factory headlight adjustment. The pattern is very wide and high.  Might be annoying to oncoming drivers.5- The bulb color is bright white, similar to a HID bulb and they come with colored lens covers which would probably look even closer if thats the look you are after but I did not use them.Not sure if I would recommend them to anyone. I will have to drive with them for a while and report back

This worked to help break the super-tight crank pulley bolt on a 2.7 liter Tacoma. The only issue is that the provided pulley adapters didn't really fit the Tacoma pulley holes, creating a situation where there was too much flex/play when trying to loosen the crank bolt (picture shows the adapters included with the unit, not the metric bolts I wound up using).I solved this by buying some bolts that fit the Toyota pulley holes and backing them up with nuts on the holder. Very happy with the tool, as it enabled me to break a bolt loose that I really struggled with.

Solid pieces! I recommend looking into "American Flag SS badge overlays", those will really top these off! I put an LS1 from a '02 camaro SS into my 2011 Genesis Coupe so I decided to put the badges on the match the drivetrain!

For the price it's a really decent light. Used this to replace the worthless dome light in my XJ Cherokee. Really bright. The color is a natural light rather than 6000k or 8000k led like the bulbs I have in the front of the Jeep, but I think I will have to replace those with ones that match this one.

I was going to just install an 80a relay on a switch, but this thing wasn't much more. It's a great value. The mounting bracket could be sturdier, but that's my only criticism. Instalation was easy.

Did it's job for releasing fuel lines on my Nissan Frontier.Nice aluminum design, with hinge, and front locking pin to keep the two halves together when closed.I only dropped one star because the rivet-hinge design was too loose. I ended up using a small punch and hammer to slightly tighten the rivet. Now the hinge is tight like it should be!I still do recommend it for those you need to release the fuel lines on your import vehicle!CPS

I bought one of these from CampingMAXX. It simply doesn't fit on a can. It not only leaks gas all over, but falls off if I don't hold it on while pouring, which is just about impossible since I don't have three hands. It just won't clamp onto a can properly. And why not? At a guess, maybe the fact that the pivot pin for the clamp is drilled at a weird angle - see the photo - might have something to do with it. This spout looks like it was made in the dark. CampingMAXX sent me a replacement ... which is identical to the first one. Same angle to the pivot pin, same non-functionality.Now, the problem could possibly be that maybe my can is junk ... considering the wide variety of rubbish which is sold as NATO cans, it's certainly possible. Although the can's own cap fits correctly and seals airtight without fail, so at least my can's neck and the attachment points for the clamps seem to be all well and functional, implying that a properly-made spout should also clamp up nice and gas-tight. But even if my can was wonky, that wouldn't explain the obviously defective assembly of this spout. The photo shows all. I could post a photo of the second spout as well, but it wouldn't be particularly illuminating; the assembly defect is identical.So, there's $30+ dollars down the drain, for a spout which can't work. (Two spouts, actually.) If I wanted spouts which don't work, I'd have bought Chinese cheapos, which are at least cheap.

This bag turned out to be exactly what I wanted, which is just big enough for a lunch box and a few other items such as glasses and small first aid kit. Without the lunch box, it would probably fit a rain jacket and a pair of shoes nicely, just for reference. Based on one review I thought it might be too big, but I think maybe that person reviewed the incorrect bag? The quality appears good with big sturdy zippers but only time will tell for sure. The rain hood is a very nice feature that seems to work well and stores in it's own pocket, and there is some bonus room in there for small items. If you want luggage for all-day outings, it's probably not for you unless teamed with the matching saddle bags.I bought it at a nice discount price "Used-Like New" from Amazon Warehouse Deals and the description is accurate, as I cannot find any faults with it. I feel like a got a great bargain.See pics of the Yamaha TW200.

Nice wheels at a decent price. One of the only few wheels that amazon prime ships to my APO box. Looks great on my jeep mounted with 285/70/17s cooper st maxx. The 17x9 5x5 0 offset with 5" backspace fits perfectly and gives it a nice stance. No rubbing without a lift but a bit heavy at 33.8 lbs each. My only gripe is location of the valve stem is a little tight. Will update if theres any issues once i put some miles on it.

Initial impression is good. I'm hoping they last because they look a lot better than the stock one and replacing it OEM would have been $185 vs this one for $45 including overnight shipping. The service member in the Ford parts department actually laughed on the phone when he looked up the price for me and saw how much it was.

I live in the desert and evening temperatures still around 100 degrees after sun down. Charging my batteries outside and the charger shows high surrounding temperatures and shuts down every 5-10 minutes. Also the charge indicator gauge read the same 85% on 3 cars so far at start which is definitely looks weird. Different age and type batteries so it is hard to believe that they have the same charge level.Will see how it performs on the long run and Update my rating accordingly.Car #4 battery shows as 85% charged as well. I don't think I can trust that reading. It must be a decoration and not a fully functioning display.

This worked excellent to prevent and stop external engine corrosion and lubes the cables. It seems safe for the surface of engine rubbers and plastics. Very highly recommended for its intended recommendations. Works great on transmissions too. Applied about a month ago and the results are excellent on a clean engine. This is the only product I'm aware of that works this great.

See the pictures I placed 6 lbs of weights on this and it started sliding down, that's far from the 15 lbs claimed. There one I got was covered in oil as well. The final straw is the extension treats that pull out can't be locked. They just glide along rivets with no way to tighten then down

I bought this in both red and black so i'll just be posting the same review for both colors and hope Amazon doesn't think I'm stupid.This vinyl was great to work with. I did a full hood strip on my car with it and had no trouble with bubbling or sticking. It was very flexible and easy to use. I didn't need a vinyl applicator - my fingers were enough to smooth out the couple bubbles I experienced.I did notice when cutting it my exacto blade tried to track the carbon weave pattern. Be sure to use a very sharp blade and remember that slow and steady wins the race.

I am using this organizer a little differently than what it's designed for - and it's great. See my photo. Instead of attaching it to a car seat, I screwed it into the side of a dresser which is next to my bed. It's a very convenient way for me to keep the TV remote, flashlight, tablet, Kindle, reading glasses,keyboard and mouse for my smart TV etc. All within easy access and out of the way when not needed.

First of all, I was expecting exactly what is in the picture (just a black grill); instead, a new Audi ring to go on the grill came with it, as well as an RS4 badge for the front, and another for the rear and the advertised parking sensor clips. Although I didn't use the badges or parking sensor clips, the sentiment blew me away. This grill completely changes the look of the A4 to have a very aggressive posture, and looks amazing! It was a very easy install with the help of a how-to I found on Google, and took about 1hr from start to finish, time well spent!My only gripe which may or may not have to do with this bumper, is that my 2009 A4 (B8 body style) has this huge sensor thing that connects behind the stock grill via 3 bolts, and some kind of air temp sensor which clips onto the back of the stock grill. None of these bolt holes/sensor clip were provided (and to play devil's advocate, there would honestly be no good way to hide them with this grill). I did not take a star away from this as I am unsure if this was a production error or otherwise. I used two black zipties to hold the huge sensor behind the rings, and I ziptied the air intake sensor to that huge sensor so it all worked out and it's completely invisible unless you look REALLY hard.I would highly recommend taking your crash bar off and spray painting it black, because, as you can see on mine, it is very silver and draws attention away from the grill's beauty.

Posted a couple videos to show how easy it is to remove on a Avalon and should be similar on earlier and later year models. Very straightforward swap remove a few screws and pop the glove box assembly out. Pictures cannot describe how disgusting this filter was and kind of upset that it I drove around for nearly a month after driving this car not to check if that filter was replaced. Great product and fit perfectly on the case for my car.

I put these on a CBR600 F4i and they fit perfectly.  I used M6x14 stainless cap screws in place of the OEM screws and the heads fit very snugly within the recessed areas of the mirrors.  The mounts are made out of metal, while the mirror body is plastic.  The mirrors themselves are flat and shiny, with no obvious defects.  This is indeed a pair of mirrors, even though it doesn't specify.Update 3/12/17: I discovered that you really have to crank down on the hex screw at the base of each mirror to prevent it from folding in at speed.  One of these mirrors swung into me while riding.

These replacements are easy to install. Took 2 screwdrivers and about 15 minutes. I installed my first set about 3 years ago. They did tighten up the fit on my hood - almost too tight, but they only lasted about 3 years. Then one has a catastrophic failure by splitting out. I checked the other side and found it to be on the brink of failure.  They are relatively inexpensive - but I would expect a decade of service out of something so simple. After making this "upgrade" there is no way to go back to the original, so you are left with the option of buying another set from Daystar or upgrade further to a much more expensive solution.  One star for each year of functionality.

I purchased two of these for my Eldorados.  I previously had purchased the 3-layer cover by Classic Accessories and it lasted 5 years and had only just begun to deteriorate. These covers are very well made. The seams are triple stitched, double stitched around the bottom hem and elasticized front and back. The front of the cover has a tag that says "front", so no question as to which way it goes on. The storage bag is connected to the cover by a strap. I cut it loose because my covers will be staying on long-term. The locking cable is a little squirrely to connect on the end with the lock, but it's doable. There are canvas strap loops that are securely stitched on the bottom hem, mid-car, that the cable threads through. I used a couple of bungees connected to create enough length to go under the car and it held the cover on better in high wind than the cable does. The cable creates too much slack and the wind whips under the cover lifting it. I also have some concern about it whipping against the paint on the car.This cover is heavyweight, but easy enough for one person to put on the car. I'm a petite woman and have no problems with it. Mine have both been through a fairly substantial storm and held up very well. You will not be sorry you bought it.

I just put these in my 2004 Wrangler TJ to replace the stock lights. They were still in good working order, but where the old sealed beam style light.These are a GREAT upgrade option! I love them!The are not only brighter than the stock lights, but they have a MUCH better beam pattern. They put the light where you need and not where you don't. I have not been flashed one time after putting these in and I have them aimed where they are putting light a good bit down the road. I was actually worried I was going to be flashed do to how high I aimed them but after a week if making a 1 hour drive in the dark every day not a single flash.I did use the bulb that came with them but I plan to upgrade those later on. They were about 30% brighter than my stock lights. But don't let that fool you, they are so much better at controlling the light that you can see much farther. At least 2X as far! The high beam lights are probably 50% brighter than stock! And they're way more usable to!For the money I don't think there is a better upgraded light out there. I tried 2 of those LED lights for almost 2X the price and returned both as their beam pattern was total crap. They were bright yes. But they did not put the light where you need it. They just lit the center of the road up a lot.These lights also dropped right in. Total plug and play!Pros:Brighter than sealed beam lights.MUCH better light control over the stock style Sylvania headlight that where in the Jeep.Lens is much flatter than the OE style light. (I think this looks better)Glass construction means no fading or scratching like the cheap plastic competition housings.Plug and play!Replaceable bulb. (Easy to upgrade to a better one)Dust cover fits well and seems well made.Cons:Not as trendy as LED or HID. (This one is subjective really. I'm fine with them! But some will skip them do to this.)The don't make an HID ready version. (Please do NOT put an HID kit in these. The reflector is all wrong for an HID bulb and it will make a total mess of the beam! Same as most all non projector housing lights.)Overall I LOVE these lights. There actually just as good or even better than the lights that come in most modern cars that do not have projectors, LED's, or HIDs stock.I was planing to use these only until I had the cash to build a full projector HID retrofit out of some stock 2015 Wrangler headlights. But after seeing how good they are I plan to just get some better bulbs for them and save that cash for other upgrades.Here are some pics of the lights for you. These were taken with my cell phone so they're not perfect but they give you a good idea if what the lights look like. The only thing the camera seems to have screwed up is that they're a little less white in person then the photos show. But not much. And some good bulbs could easily get them to be this exact color and be even a little brighter to!Please note that I had them aimed a little too low in these pics as well.  So they have a much better reach now that I aimed them up a little more.

I got these specifically for my wife's Audi Q5 backup lights, after my wife thought it was a good idea to take her car to pick up the kid, without realizing my car was behind hers. I reminded her my car is behind hers before she left. "But honey, I told you to take my car." The rest was history. And I couldn't bring it up again without her getting upset at me. OK. So maybe she couldn't see the image on the backup camera screen. My bad.Upon receiving this and two other types of 921 bulbs for review, I noticed that this is very different from the other two types:#1&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/50-off-AKILULU-New-Generation-CANBUS-Error-Free-921-912-906-T15-1000-Lumen-4014-45-SMD-LED-Lights-Bulbs-for-BackUp-Reverse-Light-6500K-Xenon-White/dp/B0193ISBUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">50% off AKILULU New Generation CANBUS Error Free 921 912 906 T15 1000 Lumen 4014 45-SMD LED Lights Bulbs for BackUp Reverse Light 6500K+ Xenon White</a>AND#2&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/LED-import-USA-800-lumens-really-Bright-Error-Free-921-912-LX-Chipsets-LED-Bulbs-For-Backup-Reverse-Lights-6000K-white/dp/B019R0IFVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">LED import USA 800 lumens really Bright Error Free 921 912 LX Chipsets LED Bulbs For Backup Reverse Lights, 6000K white</a>The first set (#1) has a 6 2835 LEDs (2.8x3.5mm) on each side and 3 LEDs on the end. Seems to be well soldered and a heat sink sandwiched behind the boards.The second set (#2) has 45 pieces 4014 LEDs scattered on three sides, The end has 9 pieces LEDs.The third set [THIS IS THE SET I'M REVIEWING HERE] (#3) has 2 LEDs x 4 places 90 degrees apart and 2 LEDs behind the projector lens. Total 10 2835s. This is only 10 LEDs, whereas the other ones have 15 of the same size LED or 45 4014 LEDs. So I expect the output to be dimmer.My review compares the three types so you can make the best judgement out of the three styles.#1 and #2 are both very bright. The second set might have a slight edge over set 1. #3 trails behind quite a bit. The projector is gimmicky as I don't think it really concentrates the light. And only have 2 2835 instead of 3 on #1 and 9 4014 LEDs. You can tell that #3 isn't going to have the brightest output.#1 and #2, when installed, points straight at the bowl of the reflector, this allows the main LED boards to cast most of the light towards the reflector bowl and reflect out through the lens. IF your bowl is a full round, you will have NO light reflecting off the top or bottom. But because my Audi's reverse reflector only has a bowl on left and right of the bulb, this works beautifully. The top and bottom of the reflector is flat in my case, so any light cast on them would be wasted. The outwards pointing LEDs at the end also helps with casting light straight to the back.#3 is the poor performer here, it only has 4 LEDs casting on the left and right bowl. The other 4 LEDs at 6 and 12 oclock doesn't do much. The rear facing projector is also not very good and putting out a lot of light.As far as the light output goes #1 and #2 is the clear winner here. BUT, read on..These light bulbs also put out a lot of heat. So much so that the heat sinks are too hot to touch after being on for a couple minutes. It makes swapping the bulbs painful. It's at least as hot as the incandescent bulbs that they replaced. The longevity of these will depend on how long you run them at a time. As heat will eventually degrade the performance of the LEDs. It seems the heatsinks are not big enough. And forget the crap about them stating that they're 6061-T6 Aerospace blah blah blah. 6061-T6 is probably the crappiest grade of aerospace material but it is light weight. I don't think it should affect strength nor is weight an issue here, its job is to disperse heat here. They use it because it's what most heat sinks are made of. And being a T6 temper doesn't really mean anything here. The concern is whether it is big enough to disperse the heat.I think the heatsinking might be a bit underspec'd and the LED will not last very long if you intend to use it as a rear fog or marker light. For a reverse light, it should last a long time.For #3, it might be a little cooler running. And it's probably better if you don't need the intensity and the reflector is a round bowl instead of a truncated bowl like mine.Audi CANBUS compatibility:#1 and #2 worked ok. It did trigger a bulb out but corrected itself later.#3 DID NOT WORK. THIS IS THE SET I AM REVIEWING HERE. Beware if you have a need for Canbus compatibility. Instant bulb out message.Included are pictures showing the comparison of the incandescent vs #1. As you can see the beam is much wider and whiter. My wife noticed the difference right away. The rear view is now a lot brighter and the sides are lit up a bit better. I can see the bushes on the side much better than before.I received a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.More pics to follow

This is the real deal....  Beautiful hitch.  Perfect in every way.  Fast delivery , packaging very good.  Recommend two people for install.  And use a floor jack to raise the hitch into position.  Used an impact wrench to tighten the dog fool out of bolts , then had my homie put four nice welds to really finish it off right.  Does take some wrangling to align properly , but be patient , it fits.  Very happy with purchase.  Pulled a 5200 lb dump trailer this weekend with no problem.  Not sure how it could be any better.

I have a Ram 1500 limited and the antenna holder didn't match the truck? Got this paint to match it up and it did a good job. It's more for small stuff so using the little brush was like painting a toy with fingernail polish. It took a minute, but it's fine. I also touched up my grill and was wishing for a bigger brush there too but the paint seems to be good and matches well. I'd purchase again if I needed more but do wish it had an option for more than the fine tip and nail polish size brush.

Look great. Not the brightest, but work well for gauge light applications. The main gauge backlight lights fit right in, the screen backlights and blinkers and other indicators, I had to shave down the boards a little with a file so they would fit through the hole. Everything worked out and they look much better than that dull yellow/greenish. 02 Forester.

Yet another light bar filled with water.  A picture is worth a thousand words.  They have a great promotional video showing how indestructible they are, but after a couple days of rain, I have a ton of water.  However...take the end cap off and the water evaporates.  Do this before the mold sets in.  Great for desert use - would not recommend where it snows or rains.04/25/2017: Upgraded from 1 star to 3 star as the water seems to not affect the light.

Firstly, i give this mohawk 4/5 stars because if you just purchase the product itself its good. But once i saw that the seller offered an add on (color reflectors) it was an instant must have. (It was kind of like saying come by this corvette for a great price, beware! it has tires so bald that you cannot exceed 50 mph. due know though, ill sell you brand new tires for only 18 dollars more and itll bring it to full potential)  I will be honest, i saw the reflectors prior to ordering this and completely dismissed the fact that they said "RUBBER MOHAWK NOT INCLUDED". This said, i am in love with it! Everyday i either get a thumbs up from drivers at stop lights, children who just smile at it, or people just downright say this product makes my helmet. Upon installation get creative with it! take a look at my pictures for instance.

This seems to be a very sturdy product however, the screws supplied were not useable even with a pilot hole being pre-drilled. The supplied screws either stripped out on my bumper or the heads came of while trying to go in, I just replaced them with self-tapping sheet metal screws and had no problem. Using it for the block heater in my 2000 F-350 with a 7.3 Diesel.

I say this heavy heart. . Opt 7 makes a great product. But there customer service sucks. My light bar show up with the box open hex mounting screws missing. Contact 0pt 7.  4 days later I get a email : I'm sorry to hear that you are having some difficulties with your order. Unfortunately, We do not have replacement Allen screws to send out. You have 2 options available. We can initiate a return for refund. Or, you can go to the local hardware store and get replacement Allen screws there and we can offer you a partial discount for your order. Please let us know how you wish to proceed.  I sent them an email back wanting  the size and pitch of the screw. And got this. Thank you for the update. Unfortunately, we do not know the exact screw size. What you can do is, take a couple to try and thread it into the holes and see which ones fit.  We apologize for the inconvenience. Please let us know if you have anymore questions. Mounted the light bar  after some difficulties of finding the right screws. It looks great. Very well made. The amount of light it puts out is awesome! I was a really big fan of opt 7. I have their flux LED headlights, a 32 light bar, pod fog lights an tail lights This is my 2nd time dealing with their poor customer service. First time I was sent the wrong warranty replace led bulb. It took me over 2 months to get the correct bulb  Actually had to contact paypal to make them send me the correct replacement bulb. You be the judge. As much money as I've spent with opt 7.  I think I will spend my money somewhere else now.

I bought these for my white 2006 Toyota Tacoma because they were among the cheapest good looking wheels I could find that I knew would fit my Tacoma. Tacoma's are a little tricky because you have to get the backspacing right as well as the rare 6 lug design. These fit perfectly and the backspacing is better than stock, which sticks the tires out a little further on each wheel, giving my truck a wider and more aggressive looking stance that I love. Already got a bunch of compliments and I'm much more happy to hop in my truck every day now. It looked pretty lame with the basic wheels it came with. I can confirm these are 6x5.5", 16" diameter by 8 inches wide. Absolutely no complaints - they look great and the price is unbeatable - especially with Amazon prime with free 2 day shipping. When I purchased them, Amazon said to expect an additional 1-2 days processing, but I still got them in two days with Prime. I found these elsewhere online for $80 more each.I used these lug nuts&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Gorilla-Automotive-21133BC-Diameter-Thread/dp/B001O0AMZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Gorilla Automotive 21133BC Diameter Thread</a>&nbsp;and these wheel locks&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Gorilla-Automotive-71631NBC-Chrome-Thread/dp/B002809QXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Gorilla Automotive 71631NBC Chrome Thread</a>&nbsp;for the install. It is worth noting that the lug nuts linked here also require a special key, so essentially every lug on my wheels is a locking lug which is great.I'm adding a picture of my white tacoma for reference if I can figure out how.UPDATE: WARNING: If you're installing this on a 2006 or same generation Tacoma, you will want to buy some hub centric rings to ensure these wheels fit properly. The bore on these wheels is 108mm while the Tacoma has a 106mm hub. If you install these wheels without a centric ring, they will fit, but you will get some bad steering vibrations which appear to be from improper wheel/tire balancing. This is not the case. It is due to the difference in the bore size of this wheel and your hub. Pick up a set of Gorilla 108-106.1 hub centric rings to solve this problem and ensure everything fits right!&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/B0032HQJ7G/dp/B0032HQJ7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">B0032HQJ7G</a>&nbsp;I learned the hard way so you don't have to.

Fits my 2002 Honda Accord perfect. I had originally purchased this filter for my 06 5.7 hemi  however, the filter fit fine on my 06 Ram  and did it's purpose i felt more air flow could be achieved with a longer air filter i ended up purchasing  a Spectre 6" long air filter for Ram and placed the K and N filter on my  2.4L Honda

I replaced my incandescent tail light with these LEDs bulbs on my R53 Mini. Installation was straight forward and they work without any issues. It's been a couple days and I haven't had any errors popping up, so I think I'm all good.The quality of the bulbs looks great. They're bright, seem to be made well, and feel fairly durable. The parts are cut clean and the soldering was applied neatly. Overall, I have no complaints and they're on par with my expectations for the price. *I received this product for review purposes. Products are judged on construction, quality, value, what they do, and how well they do it. ZxZ

For $200, this thing cannot be beat. True prime shipping, 2 days via UPS. Box was is good shape, no dings or dents. Installed in about an hour. Took me a little bit of time to figure out which of the 3 settings I wanted the anchors set to. That will make more sense when you begin installation.All parts were present, no real QA issues either. Cover is well built and sturdy! Canvas top was thicker than I expected. Folding feature is a huge plus. Purchased for a 10 day family trip from Florida to North Carolina and back. All of our bags have stayed nice and dry! MINIMAL water intrusion, I'm talking single drops of water in one place or two. If water resistance is a concern, stop worrying. Properly installed this will keep all your gear nice and dry! Drove about 80 mph on the interstate, no issues whatsoever. Highly recommend. simply does what it says.

I just received these and put them in my 2014 F150 and they fit like a glove. After some of the reviews I read and the "styles may vary" stipulation I was a little skeptical. No more. Great quality, easy to fold (follow the instructions), easy to store, black on one side and gray on the other. Very, very nice.

The mount fits the brake side clamp perfectly.  I am using this to mount a Garmin Etrex 10 and it mounts up solid as a rock.The mount will not fit the clutch side clamp.  Neither of the sets of screws included with the kit fit that clamp.

I should have either bought the cheaper ones and expected junk, or bought the much nicer ones and had them actually line up right.No matter how we positioned these there is always a gap somewhere. With two of us lining them up and another person drilling the holes(more on that later) I still need to go back and fill the gaps with something.So, the pre-marked spots to drill are nice but if you're 1/4" off it'll cause a weird flex and create gaps. The best system we found was to drill a tiny pilot hole, put the flare on, and then drill the hole to line up with the hole in the truck once the flare is in position.Installation was a pain in the butt and they don't line up well, but they definitely look good (from about 10 feet away)  If I had to buy again I'd either spend more money on good ones or less money and expect this kind of quality.

Update: finally got it out on the road and there were no problems. Added bonus - I put it over there (3) full size bikes. It held up well as its made of very heavy fabric.  Pre review, until I get a chance to take it out: Arrived today so I "tried it on", just to make sure it would fit on my 4-bike-rack with two flat-bar bikes, and the good news, it fit with no problems. Seems fairly heavy duty and well built. The hitch mount velcro fastened "sleeve" is well thought out and goes on with little effort. I purchased this to go on the back of an RV and it appears to be a perfect fit. I plan on following the instruction sheet recommendations of securing the straps and adding additional rope (bungees) to minimize wind resistance. I doubt my brake lights will be sufficiently visible if I use it on my SUV so I will use my add-on break and turn lights. More later...

After all, you may run them for hours on end if you're on a road trip, camping, hunting, or fishing. Test with a multimeter to determine the proper load, check the resistance, and verify continuity for all connections. Use the correct power supply. And double check all of your connections a second time before powering up.Now let's talk about the numbers, and what they really mean.So, what is the lumen output? Can you believe the seller's product description of 2700 Lumen, with 27 watt output per lamp? As an installer and enthusiast, I invest in equipment as needed. I have yet to really need to invest in a light meter to measure lumen with. But I do have a multimeter, which tells me a different story contradicting the product description. However, in the case of LED lighting, the load of the lamp has nothing to do with the lumen output and illumination provided by the lamp. With incandescent, wattage was directed related to the lamp's candlepower. So do not confuse LED with incandescent technology and rating.In the old days when you bought light bulbs, halogen / incandescent light bulbs, you bought light bulbs based on watts. Most of us used 60 watt light bulbs in our homes. When buying an incandescent bulb, the watts rating gives consumers a good indication of how bright a bulb is. The more watts, the brighter the bulb.The rules have changed, though. An LED that uses 60 watts is in no way comparable to an incandescent bulb that uses 60 watts. In fact, a 60-watt LED just may blind you. LEDs are designed to use less energy and naturally have a lower watt rating. This means it's useless to use watts to determine brightness.When you buy an LED replacement light bulb, the package will say "60 watt equivalent", but the bulb is actually about 8.5 watts.This is suppose to be a 27 watts equivalent spot light.  4 should equal 108 watts.  With all 4 hooked up, my multimeter shows the load at under 5 amps.  4.76 amps.  57.12 watts.  With a little fluctuation, you should be fine if you fuse with 5 amps, for up to 60 watts load.To put it all in perspective, your car's halogen headlight is 55 watts for low beam, and 65 watts for high beam. In the old days, when you bought those big round off road lights, the really bright lights were 100 watts and illegal! So at it's peak, with all 4 spot lights running, they will be about as bright as having the high beams on.  Just 1 light, which is suppose to be about half as bright as a headlight, is about as bright as a tail light or parking light.  That does not mean you will get the same lighting. LED and halogen do not work in the same way. Halogen lamps will "throw" a beam farther, although it's usually a dimmer yellow light. LED at the correct color temperature, will literally "paint with light", and turn night into day. You will notice that LED lights are "brighter" if you stare into them, and they make everything in front of them a lot brighter, because it's a white light as opposed to a yellow light.Candlepower and lumens measure different light qualities, and 1 candlepower equals 12.57 lumens. When measuring lumens, you can also think of it as the light illuminated in a 1-square-foot area one foot away from a single candle.These will hurt your eyes if you stare into them.So if you're following me so far, running all four lights gives you an equivalent amount of light as having your headlights on.  And, while these little spot lights are bright, you will just not have as much lighting distance.  There.  You don't have to read between the lines.  I spelled it out.So why buy them?  Added lighting is always good.  In different ways.  When you're out camping, night hunting, or committing commercial burglaries......you may need extra lighting, without having to turn on all of the lights on your car.  This will give you an equal amount of light, of a separate circuit, using a lot less energy.If mounted and aimed properly, these spotlights will light up what your headlights are missing.  think about mounting them in reverse, so that you can see what you're doing when loading and unloading a pick up truck.  Mount them facing to the side as alley lights.  I like these on motorcycles, wired so that they can be on with a steady beam, and then flash in a wig wag pattern with the flip of a switch.But none of this means anything when the pieces don't fit.  Fitment is a problem.  The brackets do not fit.  The photos on the product description are perfect.  The actual pieces which shipped with lamps are not perfect.  The actual brackets that came with my lamps are over 1/8" too large.

This product works fine and does make a difference, except you may first want to wash your tires and then let them dry out for a few hours.  I did not wash my tires and just applied the coat.  See the pictures.  For a more meticulous job, I would recommend washing the tires first, letting them dry and then apply multiple gel coats on consecutive days.  This bottle is good for several coats.

This product is of a high quality. It is much heavier than I thought it would be for the price. It has a weight of over 29 ounces, and it feels very sturdy and heavy in one's hand. Considering the price, this is a very good deal. It stated as a 4 inch jaw, but it does open up to 6 inches. If you need one, I would recommend this product. JC

As others mentioned, the hitch is fairly loose. There's play both in the reciever as well as in the part with the ball that attaches to the drop part. The lock pin also does not fit my hitch (2014 Ram 2500). Other than that it works great for my lifted truck and im happy with it.

This will not only bring your paint back to its former brilliance, it is also GREAT for making old headlights CLEAR as new! My headlights were very bad for seeing at night but a quick 5 minuted with an orbital buffer and this product alone, they were like brand new!See photos of what the headlight looked like before buffing and what it looked like after. (Sorry I didn't take photo of same headlight)Look at how much more brilliant the paint is after just a couple minutes of buffing!No need for a $20-30+ special kit and NO sanding is needed whatsoever.

Install was relatively easy if you're somewhat handy. Drilling was pretty simple and everything went as smoothly as zipping the windows on a wrangler goes. Quality is decent (You get what u pay for) only worrisome parts are where the top attaches to the header (they don't use about 4 screws that the factory top used to attach), there are parts towards the rear of the top that sink in, making me wonder if rain water will pool in those spots, and the rear window isn't as taut as I would like it to be, so it wrinkles a bit. Hopefully with time none of these will be major issues. Only time will tell.

This review is for JUST the 250 gram can. This is stellar polish (10 stars!) but the big can it comes in is a disaster. I thought it would have a screw-on lid, but it is built like a paint can - you have to pry it open by working a screwdriver around and around, and it is darned tight! The lip ends up being all bent and deformed, and there is no way the can will remain airtight after a few uses. If air gets to the polish it will dry out and be useless. Because it is so costly, I transferred all the contents to five small prescription pill bottles. That way I can use one at a time and the full ones will hopefully remain fresh for many years. The 250 gr size either needs a new can design, with easy to close lid, or a really big squishy tube... In the meantime, I recommend that folks order the muli-packs of small tubes to avoid this hassle. JD Spokane WA

These fit my dome, map and rear seat dome lights on my 2001 F150 Supercrew. They are very bright and lighten up the interior well. The sides of the bulbs (silver ends) where they connect are a bit smaller than the regular halogen lights would have to you kind of have to move it in the right spot so they can stay or they won't work, but I have had them for about a week and they have been doing their job well.

This cabin air filter replacement product fit my 2013 Mazda CX-5 perfectly. This is NOT a genuine Mazda part, but it compares very nicely to the original. I cannot speak of the specific density of the material used, but a visual look at light sources and blowing through the materials these seem quite identical. See the photos to notice the markings that the Mazda product has.Replacement took me all of 5 minutes. You simply push the sides of the glove box in so the "stop peg" can clear the "stop". This takes a bit more force than I initially thought, but do it slowly, one side at a time and you hear a "click" when the side is free. The filter is straight ahead, pulls right out and the new one goes in. It only fits one way, you you cannot insert it upside down.  My dealer wanted $60 (parts & labor) to replace this!

YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE (NON BRIGHTENED PHOTOS SHOWN, TAKEN AT NIGHT OF INSTALLATION IN A DARK AREA) OF BEFORE (STOCK ON LEFT (PASSENGER SIDE) AND THE UPGRADED LED ON THE RIGHT (DRIVERS SIDE)) MUCH BRIGHTER, (MORE LUMENS). I DO WISH THAT THE FOG LIGHT ASSEMBLY HOUSING ON THE SUV SHOWN HAD A BACKWARDS REFLECTOR RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE BULB ITSELF, TO REFRACT MORE LIGHT FWD OFF THE BACK WALL OF THE HOUSING. KEEP IN MIND THESE BULBS ARE ONLY REPLACING 29 WATT HALOGENS, NOT 55 LIKE SOME OTHERS OUT THERE, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO PUSH THE WATTS UP AND MELT THE WIRING... BECAUSE HIGH POWERED LED'S DO USE LESS WATTS, AND AMPS, BUT CAN STILL USE A SIGNIFICANT LOAD AND THE NEXT MODEL UP AVAILABLE HERE, WITH A DIFFERENT STOCK # WAS AT 30 WATTS OF LOAD, VERSUS THESE RUNNING AT MUCH LESS BUT PROVIDING MORE LUMENS TO LIGHT UP OBJECTS IN THE ROAD IN FRONT OF YOU, ALONG WITH STREET SIGNS, ROAD LINES ETC.I'M CONSIDERING ACQUIRING NEW HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLIES AND THEN THROWING A MORE POWERFUL SET OF BULBS INTO THE PROJECTORS WHICH I'M SURE WOULD BE MUCH BRIGHTER AND WHITER THAN STOCK XENON BULBS ANY DAY. AND WOULD MATCH THE ALREADY AWESOME OPT 7 881 FOG LIGHTS.

I installed these bulbs today. I enjoy the whiter color then stock but they are not as bright as stock. If looks are more important then function, these will due. Both stock and these are rated 55 W but the output of these look like 35 W. Maybe I've should of gotten the 100 W bulbs in this type. I was concerned about possible heat issues with the 100 W ones. The Picture shows the new right one vs the old left one. Exposure does not show the brightness difference.

Overall, this is an excellent magnet mounted tray that I use in my gun safes and on my refrigerator.  In my safes, I use 6 of these to hold polymer magazines and some heavier handguns (note: if firearm or magazine is metal, don't let it touch magnetized side of tray).  The 12" tray holds over 5 pounds of water bottles (see picture).  I wouldn't put more than that on it, or place such weight on it if this were used in a high vibration area, but on our smaller fridge its does well and the magnets are just insanely strong.  I almost knocked one star for the product label that required a lot of time and Goo-Gone to fully remove.

These faux leather seat covers are amazing. It does take some time for them to mold perfectly into your car seat's shape. If it's winter, it might take longer for it to settle, but during the summer it just takes 2 weeks for it to look completely molded into my car seat.I own an older version of the Honda Fit Sport, and it's perfect. Since I have bucket seats, it's a  bit tight, but it makes it look like it manufacturer leather.Reviewer DisclaimerI used a discount code to purchase this product.

I purchased generic brand LED bulbs for the interior of my 2007 Pontiac Grand Prix. they lasted about a year and the flickering started. I shopped around and I came across these Yorkim bulbs and decided to give them a shot. I was instantly impressed with the components quality of these bulbs,  I attached picture to compare next to my old bulbs. They are way brighter than I expected and they gave my car a crisp clean look. Will be installing these bulbs on my 2005 GMC yukon map lights. I will write a follow up review in about a year with the progress of these bulbs.

Works like a champ!  I really only needed a 2P2T relay and socket but this one fit the bill just fine.  I needed a relay to control my daylight headlights (2003 Toyota Tacoma you can't ever completely turn off the headlights while it is running).  I cut my middle head light wire on each headlight, ran them up to this relay (Hot side of the headlight wire to contact 12 and contact 11, also ran a pigtail from 11 down to contact 14 for the +12 to operate the relayThen connected wires back to the headlights from 4 and 3 respectively. This allowed the lights to work as they normally do.  I then ran a wire from 13 into the glove box of my truck and connected that to a groundswitching the switch applied a ground completing the circuit from contact 13 (-) to contact 14 (+)this energized the relay which opened the headlight circuit.I have noticed people asking how the relay is wiredHere is a quick rundown.  14: Plus voltage to control relay, 13: Negative to control relay.  12: goes to contact 4 (normally closed) and contact 8 (normally open).  11: goes to contact 3 (normally closed) and contact 7 (normally open).  10: goes to contact 2 (normally closed) and contact 6 (normally open).  9: goes to contact 1 (normally closed) and contact 5 (normally open).  Hope this helps people out.One other thing I liked about this relay is there is a little LED light that lights up when the relay is energized, just a nice added touch!  I will buy more of these, they are very handy and seem to be very well built.**UPDATE** After having this relay installed approximately 4.5 months, and using a dozen or so times...I noticed at lease one set of contacts are sticking and not working.  Not a huge problem for me as I have 2 other sets on the relay that are not being use...SO I moved the wires over to another set of contacts.  Since this happen so soon, I have marked my rating down from 5 stars to 3.  I have added a picture of the burnt contact...3rd from the left*** UPDATE to the UPDATE *** Great customer service.  Seller promptly emailed me asking if I would like a refund or a new relay.  I chose the relay.  The new relay seems to be working great!  I would buy from again and would highly recommend.  They stand behind their product!!

I put in the white 1156 bulbs into my VW Jetta 1.8 tsi to replace the standard halogen bulbs that were dim and yellow. The light from this bulb is much, much brighter than stock halogens and extremely white without a tinge of blue. The reflect really nicely in the housing and most importantly, they don't set off the "bulb out" warning light on the dashboard. As DRLs they are not really meant to help you see but to be seen, and in the pic below you can see that these bulbs will definitely be seen. (Just a heads up, changing the DRLs for the first time on a 2015 jetta can be a huge pain. I recommend using pliers to unlock it).

Darn it. I hate writing bad reviews but don't waste your time with this one. Fitment wasn't an issue like I saw in some reviews but the bulb was very un-solidly made and made rattle noises plus the color was pretty bad looking. I wanted some fogs with more of a blue tint and these are just the opposite (see picture), in the driver side is NEW Show Glow bulb and passenger is JDM Astar led fogs. Opt-7 is amazing though Im using their 35W hid kit in my low beams and they are superb. Hope I helped someone!

Here are the adapters to use, to recharge auto from small cans...You'll need a can tap to fit the small cans. I bought this one (less than $10):https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JFNAAS/And the adapter that comes with the kit doesn't fit the can tap, so I bought this one that fits well (less than $6):https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002JMF9I/The adapter was the 'tricky' part, because in refrigerant hoses they apparently don't go by the actual thread size you might measure at a hardware or auto parts store ... so it's a little confusing as to what thread size to look for. I went to several auto parts stores and hardware stores, and none of them had the adapters in stock so I could try them. So I ordered the one on Amazon that sounded like it would fit (based on reviews/comments), and it did indeed fit.I'm including a couple of pictures (the close-up shows the can-tap and the adapter installed on the yellow hose)...

I'm sort of nervous using these in exterior lights. I'm worried about moisture/condensation getting on the open circuitry. I didn't realize all that stuff was unprotected. Maybe I could pot them at home with something heat resistant. But... maybe I'll just buy some proper ones. Maybe my fears are unfounded... but i just don't want to run the risk of fire/shorts. They are working pretty good on the interior lights. Fairly bright. Not the brightest I've had in this 2012 F150... but pretty good tho.

Solid tire for the price. I mounted these on (4) 15x8 Cragar Soft 8's. These do well in light mud/dirt, they are not hardcore mud tires.. so I didn't expect them to be. The road noise isn't bad, I do get a slight hum. I drive these daily on the highway and it really doesn't bother me. These have been through 5" of snow and they did excellent. I am very impressed with the tire overall, great bang for your buck.

Really, really, really great stuff but it has a couple quirks.  It HATES heat. 2 major factors in generating heat are speed and the amount of product used. I use about 4 pea size drops on a fresh pad on a 2x2ft section,  1 or 2 after the pad has been primed. I attached pictures of what was accomplished in a very short amount of time using a foamed wool pad, HD Speed,  and a rotary polisher at 800rpm using almost no pressure applied.

These people are either comfortable driving a car too long or just looking for a beginner helmet and wants more than what they are paying.Note the more feature you want on a helmet the more riskier you are to be at an accident.This helmet is a bit whistling when you start going between 15-35... Above that the whistle stops. Now you have a combination of ventilation, natural air flow, high breathing, and moisture decompression... Hence... FOG FREE. If you are going fast on a close down helmet all the way, you would either lift up your visor every time it fogs or have some sort of high ventilation from the head piece, your chin-guard and your visor. Now what would you do when its actually foggy out? Take off the whole visor right? But your visor is made to block obstacles such as little bit pieces of rock, flies, etc.In other words, don't mind the wristle, it goes away after you rev up at bit. It is more safer that way.On the other notes, it doesnt smell. You get this fresh factory foam smell. To be honest, I like it that way. Then those that say the paint chips off like blaiming it on the paint quality.., they expect you to believe that it was just spray painted and not coated with anything else making it easy to scratch while thats not entirely true. It is coated clear with a .001 mm paint vynil film. Meaning you can scratch it obviously it will show because you are now abusing its look, but the film is taking the abuse. When you are riding, depends on where you are going, a lot of things comes at your way. The helmet will do fine against light trails and smooth surface such as highway and freeways. But it won't look pretty if you are on some rough surface, hitting your head with trees constantly or just falling off of it because your are not experienced maintaining your balance at your riding.Heres what you pay for: The impact helmet shell and construction. Removable liners are a bit more expensive but only the ear pad removable... fits the bill. Then you get a high quality paint, a new Visor Fog Design, and everything else done manually including not so great front exhaust because you actually get a lot of air coming in from the whole area of the Modular separation... Keep in mind the air flow is the same as of all air coming in and out, keeping your head cool.

Fully charged as directions say to. (Lipo batteries should be stored at 75% as how this pack came)I charged my iPhone for less then an hour. My phone went from 21% to 38%But the issue is the GB40 went from 100% to 50%.In fact when I first plugged my phone in, the light went from 100% down to 75% within 5 seconds.I've purchased a cheaper $70 pack similar to this one a year ago. Lost the power cord so went ahead and bought this genius until I find cord.The cheap knock off pack has less amps, less mAh etc.,But couldn't tell how many lawn mower jump starts and iPhone charges before it lost 50% because it was a bunch!I'm thinking I have a defective battery I'm this genius??

Very nice and heavy duty. They fit the stake pockets on my trailer well. I was curious if I would need to drill holes for the pins but the pins actually go under the pocket not through it. The only thing I may change would be to drill the pins out to put a lock on them instead of a cotter pin.

-Ordered for a 2007 Kawasaki Ninja 650r-None of the pins that came with it truly fit the hole as they are all too small-When the item was shipped the manual that was provided was not for the model of stand I ordered so it was a week of waiting for a response from the seller to find out that in deed it was the correct stand the manual was just wrong and that was why none of the parts looked correct in the instructions.-Once I got the stand together it was too short to lift my bike and after messing with it I was finally able to get the bike up on the stand but if you moved the bike at all it would come off due to the stand not locking in the correct position-In the pictures you can see that when the bike is off the ground and look at the arm of the stand does not lock over correctly so it will not be stable. Even when I can get it to "lock" position if I were to try and work on the bike just moving it in any way causes the bike to come off the stand so it is not truly locked in a stable position.-I do have a rear stand in use at the same time but it is not a venom stand I am almost wondering if you have to have a venom rear stand in order to use this front stand.

Perfect fit and function as expected from a Polaris accessory. The 1/2 windshield makes the experience so much better. all the visibility of open without the wind and dust in your eyes. If you're debating at all, just buy it. Absolutely the best cost:benefit ratio of any mod to my rzr.

I would give this no stars if I could...Used a hand full of times and the pump locked up. When I took apart the pump up it appears the belt was shredded and had wrapped around the motor causing it to lock up. I posted a picture of the inside where you can see something was installed wrong in manufacturing as the rubber belt worn a deep groove and melted only after a few uses.I would not buy this product as they use cheap plastic gears and belts inside.

These brushes are similar to the 'Natural Boar Hair Detail Brush' but are different in a few key ways.1. The bristles are much stiffer than the boar hair brush,2. I don't think these are boars hair, they may be nylon.3. These are glued much better than the natural boar hair brushes4. The smallest brush is the same width as the medium natural boar hair brush.Pros:I only lost one strand in the two times I've used them. The natural boars hair brushes lost about a dozen. They're stiffer than the natural so they're a little better when cleaning tire rubber and getting at the lug nuts. Using these brushes instead of a TufTire brush enables you to scrub the rubber where it touches the pavement. So no more cleaning the wheels and then having a dirty spot hiding next to the ground. Much less expensive than its competitors.Cons:I don't think I would use this on paint. The stiffness that makes it great for wheels and muffler tips would make it a bad thing for paint. I also wouldn't use these on scratch-able plastics on interiors.

This battery terminal works great for car audio or accessory. Fits well for 2006 Chevy Silverado. I find it makes a difficult to un-wire the audio cable from the terminal for my specific truck. But, I find that just unplugging my fuse is easier. Very happy about the purchase and cheaper than any car audio place i visited.

Perfect replacement fit for OEM O2 sensor. for the Gen 6 Honda Accord this is the 2nd or catback sensor that is attached to the catalytic converter.I give this a 4.5/5 rating because the cable does not come with a rubber part that helps keep it in place on the wire holder. Luckily I had some high temp electrical tape in the tool box (3M 33+ Super); wrapped the electrical tape around the wire until it was thick enough to be squeezed into the wire holder.Comes with anti-seizing compound to put on the threads before you install it.If you need the #1 O2 sensor - the one in the engine compartment on the exhaust manifold - get 234-4620. The wire is slightly shorter on the 234-4620 version so it won't work for the #2 sensor but if you don't care that the wire is a bit longer you can use this one for the #1 sensor spot. This one is about $8 cheaper at the time I bought both.

The plates are good quality as compared to cheaper priced brands.Some reviewers complained about the frame scratching the paint.  If this frame or other including a plastic frame can scratch the paint if it is contact with the paint when screwed on.  Even just the license plate without a frame can mark the paint.I purchased the two and four hole frames for a truck and Nissan Rouge. My state requires a front and rear license plate. No problem with the truck since the frame mounts on the front and rear bumper with no contact with the paint.The Nissan Rouge has a mounting bracket on the front bumper so no issues there.  The problem is the rear plate.  There are just two holes in the body to screw in the plate, no type of mounting bracket.  This along with other manufactures is a bad design. When screwed on the frame or bare plate will come into contact with the paint.The Nissan Rouges rear plate is the two hole version.  To solve the problem I purchased two  inch thick nylon spacers at the local big box home improvement store for less than one dollar.  The spacers act as a washer between the license plate and car body and will leave a very small gap between the frame and paint. The spacers are rigid so the frame will not distort when the screws are tightened.For added peace of mind I added rubber bumpers (see attached photo) to the bottom of the license plate.  These are stick on such as you would use on objects to protect furniture or maybe on the inside of cabinet doors.  If you have the four hole frame skip these bumpers and use four nylon spacers.I did not use the screw caps so no comment on these.  If the supplied screws do not fit will someone other than a screw inspector notice if you use the factory  screws?  Or head over to the big box store and spend a couple of bucks for the screw style of your choice.

I love these.  But they were really hard to get off the white sheet and apply to my plastic fairings on my quad.  So far one of the eyes fell off but that may have been because I had to power wash my quad to get the thick mud off.  I bought two just I case.  Over all I'm happy even with the missing eye.

These feel cheap, seem like they might break if you were to use a wrench the wrong way. I read the reviews and saw the photos and still bought them over others available because they're cheap and ship pretty quick.I hand tightened them and they look pretty decent. I'm sure they could be on there a little better but they've held the windshield on there for a couple runs going 1.50 mph so it should be all good.

I purchased this Airaid tube to replace my cracked OEM intake tube on my 1999 Toyota Tacoma Prerunner V6. For the people who wrote reviews regarding torn couplers or difficulties installing, it clearly states in the instructions to remove air box and MAF sensor then connect everything together and reinstall airbox/intake tube as one whole piece to truck itself. This kit is great, comes with everything you need, intake tube, vacuum lines, couplers, hose clamps, and top adapter for vacuum hose. Also came with pictured instructions, stickers, and CARB sticker for California Emissions. Noticed a decent amount of throttle response paired with my K&N drop in filter. Definitely makes a deep clean throaty sound when you lay into the gas. Definitely cleaned up the engine bay vs. the oem setup. Guess you might see some MPG increase but nothing significant. Would recommend if your looking to increase performance while keeping the oem airbox look/set-up, you could also take it a step further and do a deck plate mod for more performance.

I was looking for 1157 LED bulbs for my motorcycle. I have tried others in the past on automobiles and motorcycles but they were never bright enough. I purchased these LED bulbs based on past reviews. The bulbs are as bright or brighter than the SYLVANIA 1157 SilverStar High Performance Miniature Bulbs they replaced. I should also mention that I do not have clear lenses. My tail lights have translucent amber lenses. On my motorcycle my lights are running and turn signal lights all-in-one. As I stated before the running lights are as bright or brighter than the incandescent bulbs they replaced and the turn signal flashes noticeably. These lights are bright enough and function correctly but I did have an installation issue:These lights were installed on my 2011 Harley-Davidson Street Bob. The stock bullet style light housing has a chrome reflector inside. While a incandescent 1157 bulb fits in snug without an issue, this LED bulb does not. If you think of the bulb barrel as two pieces, one being the top (light) and one being the bottom (part that plugs into the socket). The first issue is the top part is wider at it's base than the incandescent bulb and will not fit in the reflector socket on my motorcycle. I had to drill out the reflector opening with a 3/4" countersink drill bit for it to fit. The second issue was the top and bottom are soldered together. The balls of solder at the joint prevents the bulb from seating correctly and needs to be filed down in order to fit. Drilling and filing are relatively easy if you have the right tools. Go slow and you should be able to install the bulb with no damage to the light housing or reflector. With all that said I do not believe that this will be an issue for everyone. I believe the compact nature of motorcycle lights is what caused the problem. If installing on a automobile, disregard this motorcycle review.One other thing to note. Turn signal bulbs are connected to the same circuit as your turn signal indicator light on your dash. Most systems are designed for incandescent bulbs. When a bulb blows or goes out it becomes a safety hazard. Because of this the circuit has been designed to flash the dash indicator quicker than normal to make the operator aware that there is an issue with the bulb. This is done by detecting a drop in voltage. The issue with LED lights is that they use less voltage and will give a false positive alert on a circuit designed for incandescent bulbs. Since the light is not actually out the bulb will also flash quicker than normal. This is often referred to as Hyper Flashing. The way to fix this issue is to install a voltage regulator into the main wire harness of your turn signal circuit. This could be a $50+ expense in addition to the cost of the bulbs.

I love this. As Ive only ever had a soft top, its a huge relief not fighting a soft window that had broken zippers when loading items into and out the tailgate! I like having the ability to keep everything on but the side windows can still open. They have mesh screens to keep bugs out.The instructions are not that bad. Just don't tighten everything down as you build the frame until everything is set. And don't tighten one side first. Gotta jump around and make sure its torqued down evenly and is flush with the body of your jk/jku. The side windows are a PAIN to get on; you got to work and stretch to get them to hook under the rear pillar rails. install the twill fabric on a sunny day if at all possible as with any soft top. I updated the review with better pictures!

I have a 2014 Ram 1500 express package, the interior lights fit but note there is no glove compartment light and the rear passenger  light is a bit too small so you'll have to clamp the brackets a touch to make a snug fit. I didn't use the rear cargo lights because I already have the led replacement brake light but the tag lights are bright, just know if they do not work then pull it out and turn 180 then put back in. Now my big issue and main reason I got this was the led replacement reverse lights, the bulbs DO NOT FIT. The reverse bulbs are about 1/2 inch wider than the led's provided and there's no way to adjust them to fit. Kinda a big let down but whatever.

These were great bulbs and gave my fog lights a very noticeable yellow look, they didn't point down road as much as my stock halogen bulbs, but I got a lot more light to the sides of my car and in front of my car than I did with just the halogens on. Just got some fog the other night, driving with these fog lights on gave me about 30% more visibility than without. These lights are noticeably yellow at night, and Im very impressed, Ive been rocking these for 2 months now, and so far no problems even with heavy use. Will update if they burn out.

Best price by far that I could find for some cheap drag tires for my front skinny's on my 2010 Mustang. My fat Ford tips the scales at 3600lbs & these do take 44lbs of air pressure to hold it up, but it works. Mostly used for track only racing, but I have driven on them to shows & they do hold up.

Great kit. Definitely adds the comfort promised this kit and similar offered on amazon and elsewhere.I do have an additional tip to add to their easy to follow instructions. The bolts they label a b c d, if you remove A first then you can push the leg back and have total freedom of access to bolt B. Likewise on the other side remove D first to have easy of access to bolt C.The instructions do mention raising the seat (bottom) to access the back bolts. It's really a must and I have posted a photo to show clearly what they mean. Wrap a bungee around head restraint to hold the seat bottom in place.Great seller. Quick shipping. Nice product.

Initially I was extremely happy with these until one of the knobs that had seen less than 10 uses would not work and required the complete disassembly of the knob in order to remove my back from the rack. Had I not been at home and had access to a particular screwdriver and pliers, I would not have been able to remove the bike at all. Disassembly revealed that the gears on the tightening mechanism had simply sheared off (see photos). I have now been forced to remove both knobs as It does little good to have a security feature which prevents me from accessing my bike.

Bought these to replace the faded original flares on my 99 Wrangler. Exactly what I expected. Install took awhile, but it was mostly getting the old ones off and inside the rear fender well to reach the back of the screws.  All hardware came with them. Install the U gasket to the flare edge that goes against the body. Drastically improved the look of the Jeep. They also stick out far enough to prevent the splash up from the 33 x 12.5 mud tires I have on the car.  Only issue was with the drivers side rock guard not matching up with the holes. Easy fix by just drillin some new holes in the guard.

These babies work great! I have only needed to have them up 1/2 way to keep my hands toasty, but that wasn't in extreme cold. But I don't ride in freezing weather either.I would have to say the only downside would be the length of them. They didn't cover the entire portion of the handle bar at the ends, but a bit of electrical tape wrapped around the ends with some 3/4" PVC caps painted black and popped on... no one knows the difference if I don't tell them!Performance wise: beautiful.

When I heard that AutoZone was carrying Meguiar's new line, I was so excited to finally try this out today! The smell vaguely reminded me of cherry Kool-Aid. The suds production is good and long lasting.It does a great job of removing the tons of mud, rain spots and other grime I had on my car with ease. Since it was snowing all day today, I didn't get to take it outside and see the full extent of the shine. However, even in a dim garage, the shine was still impressive!UPDATE: Still loving the car wash and the added wax definitely makes a difference in the rain. I've been through several downpours recently, and the entire car beads water like it's been freshly waxed! I added two new shots of the reflections I was able to get with this soap. I've never seen a white car shine this good!

4 1/2 starsUpdate:  after approx. 30 hrs of riding with the bags draped directly on and "touching" the rear fender paint...  they are scratching the paint's clear coat.  I thought this was a possibility and took a chance. The scratches can be buffed out. Just thought I'd share that info here.  I will try putting a micro clothe material as a buffer.Finally, large carry bags. I thinking I could stuff 8  2-liter bottles in each bag. I sort of tried it but didn't have 8 bottles total.Made from Top Quality material ( i don't think its water proof, not sure)Side zipper pockets have a a fabric partition wall inside.The bags come shipped compressed flat and you have to insert 2 stiff but flexible vinyl covered pieces inside to created the form of each bag.The bottom ones insert with some effort - under a fabric loop and into receiving pockets at the bottom corners.However, the other bag forming insert takes 2 men and a boy (as the old expression goes) to insert it properly in each bag.Its an inverted "U"as the illustration shows but it is soo tight and difficult to force into place...How difficult? Well, Nelson-Rigs gets a lot of calls from customers who say that piece is 6 or 8 inches too long to fit... :-)The water proof rain covers are almost as hard to put on. (but any looser and they might come off while riding)There are 2 quality shoulder straps included. They have plastic male end buckles that latch into 2 in-board fasteners to facilitate carrying the bags.The wide in-board velcro straps, up top and joining the two bags, keep the rain covers from stretching down along the inside of the bags.I worry that the main zippers might not last for years and years of use. Only time will tell.My photo shows the bags over large mounting studs (protruding 1 1/4" and not visible) still there from previous bags.

I've read the reviews on all other forums online about Pinnacle Souveran Paste Wax and everyone seems to love it especially on black cars. Car show season is coming up and I wanted my 2011 Challenger RT to look her best. I went ahead and took the plunge.Prep work is key. If your paint sucks, no wax no matter how expensive it is will make it better. My paint is a black metal flake and is pristine, so I had really high expectations for this $100 wax. My car was washed, clayed, polished and ready for her first coat of Pinnacle wax.  It went on like butter. Super easy to apply and no need to wait for it to haze. Apply in the shade on a cool car in a back and forth motion, in the direction of the airflow over the car and wipe off one section at a time. Car was waxed in 23 minutes!Drum roll..... It's ok. The shine is great, but I didn't see the liquid/3D look that everyone was talking about. I used Meguiars Gold Class paste wax about 6 weeks ago (and after 4 hours of work) I got a similar look to Pinnacle Souveran. Only time will tell how long Pinnacle will last, but in the Central California summer heat, I'm guessing not long. The car is a daily driver that is garaged but gets a wipe down every night with a California duster and spray detailer for bugs, bird dropping and dirt. Wife doesn't mind 'cause her car gets cleaned too!So here is the $100 question, is it worth it? Even for the time and labor saved? That is up to you. I enjoy taking care of my vehicles. It's my therapy time after a long day at work in front of a computer. For me,  I don't think I will ever buy it again. I had to get it just to try it out.  If you want instant gratification from a wax and want a great shine, get it. If you don't mind spending a little time waxing your car, I would use a quality Paste wax like Meguiars Gold Class. Currently I'm looking into Griots wax and another wax called Smartwax to see how they compare. You can see my picts in the user submitted picts for the product and judge for yourself.

AFter struggling for longer than I care to admit getting the covers off the mirrors (hint: press down on the front of the clips facing you, they're slots with a tab that clicks down into place) these went on without a hitch. The don't QUITE look like the stock pics here, but they look good on. They also must have fixed the fitment issue, because these fit as well as OEM for sure. The LEDs work well and look great.I thought it was pretty high on the price for these but I suppose they have a monopoly on the market as I haven't found any other vendor making them. Overall I'm pleased and people ask me about them all the time.

Less than worthless. They don't eliminate the error codes that led lights cause in a jeep JK. Avoid these and go buy something worth a flip. See for yourself, the trouble codes were cleared, these worthless boxes were installed, the jeep was started and lights turned on, the trouble codes came right back. For BOTH headlamps.AVOID THIS TRASH.

Installed on a 2013 Mazda 3 iTouring. Everything fit and matched up perfectly and only took about 25 minutes to install. Ignore the brass colored boxes with the red leads, attached to the turn signals. Those are resistors that I installed to eliminate hyper flash due to having led turn signals.

Really solid handles that look fantastic mounted. The people complain about the front ones being hard to install must have issues using a screwdriver. I had all 4 handles on in 15 minutes and I took a break to drink a beer. There are no directions but a little common sense and it's pretty simple to figure out. Can't beat the price.

The Taotronics Mode TT-HS06 portable universal multi-angle stand is heavy duty. It is somewhat heavy for its size, thus providing good stability. Contact points with the tablet (or smartphone) and the table all have rubber cushions. The bottom support is a large piece of rubber placed horizontally. The kickstand is adjustable by pressing a button inside the center of the hinge. Multiple angles are available, something simpler stands do not offer. My kid loves it. She took her 10 table out of its leather cover (also serving as a stand, but with limited angles). It looks cool on the table.  My attached pictures have a tablet that is slightly bigger and significantly heavier than an iPad. It can be placed horizontally or vertically.  A smartphone would also fit vertically or horizontally. I was given a free sample for my unbiased opinion of the product.

I bought these last summer.  Less than 8 thousand miles on them.  Truck was running good with them until a little over a month ago.  The progression from ok to horrible, barely moving truck, took about two months.  I checked a lot of things first, thinking there was no way the plugs could be that bad... but I finally just pulled the drivers side front plug and it had a crack in the ceramic!! The other plugs aren't much better... and I was missing multiple cylinders, barely making it up hills.  Motor ran so rough it broke my exhaust apart.I had this weird feeling when I bought them and it said NASCAR on the box.  I still can't believe they are this bad.  A champion lawn mower plug would last longer.Absolute worst spark plugs I have ever used.

Box label clearly states made in Japan for all components other than the small bearing.  The reality is that only the tensioner and belt are made in Japan. Not cool.As an installer, this puts me in a sticky spot. Do I return it , pay more for OEM, and deal with the increased downtime, or do I roll with what I've got?

I've been shopping around for weeks, looking for the best LED's for my 09 Toyota Prius. Came across these and took a chance. I wired them to my parking lights, took me about an hour and a roll of 16 gauge wire. You only need about 3 or 4 feet to be safe. The wire on the LED is not long enough for most applications. Now they are installed and I fear I'll be making everyone upset on the road.. Great!! They will see me coming and they will save my HID headlights from being used in the day. Very much worth the $29

Cut in half--configured for -trickle charging riding mower battery.  Female portion fitted onto metal frame of mower for support when plugging and unplugging.  A 1/2" electrician's knockout tool fits the bill perfectly for creating the appropriate size hole for this female receptacle.  A 1/2" electrician's holesaw could be used.  Very little play around threaded stud of receptacle with the knockout tool used.Attached male end to 12VDC trickle charger.  Good quality cable...very pleased with its make and durability throughout.

For the price of this soap, you can't find anything better. Everytime I wash my car it leaves it absolutely shining, glimmering. The product foams up nicely when using a foam canon. It is however scented just slightly, I don't mind the smell, by no means is it bad.Great car wash soap.

my  biggest complaint regarding the Carelove line is the screen. It is very shiny/glossy. It is nearly impossible to see the screen. If you are driving into the sun, the reflection of you driving is all you can see on the screen. Carelove must be aware of this issue because this model has what I guess is supposed to be an attachable "shade" which doesn't help at all and makes it difficult to get to the power button. Unless you drive at night, this device isn't for you which is too bad because it has a lot of features that other GPS units don't have. I have 2 different Carelove units and my complaint runs across both models purchased a year apart. I was hoping they had addresses the glare issue.The attached photo was taken this morning. As you can see all that is visible on the screen is the reflection of my phone.

I tried LiquiMoly engine flush for the first time on my 2008 Mitsubishi Outlander V6 with 96,000 Miles before changing my oil yesterday. I tried it because Im not the original owner and I can see some sludge in the crank case. I had 2500 Miles on my oil, added it and let idle for exactly 10 minutes before hoisting it up and draining. The oil that came out was VERY DARK... It looked darker than any oil I had ever changed and yet only had 2500mi. After dumping, I refilled with fully synthetic. Engine feels good as always.  Not sure if it made a difference but Ill try another bottle next time just for fun.

It's never fun having one of these motors go when we're in the depths of winter! This blower motor demonstrates excellent performance. It was an easy installation and an exact fit for my '02 GMC Envoy XL. I give it four stars only because I have no way of knowing how long it will last. The old one is on the left. Never had mice in the vehicle and I don't know where all the fuzzy junk originated inside the wheel. The new one looks larger but that is the camera angle I used. Both are the same size and are an exact fit including the wire harness.

1ST: The video review someone wrote about using on a '97 Ford Taurus and 8 of them not working, well mine looks exactly like that, no serial #, mounting catch is separate but the decal is 'up'.2nd: NOT everyone has a PC. I have a iMac so the mini-CD will NOT work (even though I can boot camp into Windows 7 Ultimate my cd/dvd drive is VERTICAL SLOT, not tray load), so this is useless.I put the Torque LITE app on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 GT-P3113 Android ICS 4.0.4, went outside plugged the OBD2 plug in, turned on bluetooth, waited, paired to it (under settings/bluetooth it will show OBDII), then started Torque Lite and bam!, worked.Also has a small, very small red LED in the lower corner when plugged in (which means getting power).On Torque I changed to faster communication and it works too.I guess the thing is this, this is all made in China, we get it cheap, it is cheap stuff it's made from but as long as it works. Maybe that guy got a batch of bad ones. It can happen.I got this from 'Able'. The sticker on the foil bag it is in says:X000FRDZIN AGPtek Super Mi...stic Scanner ToolNEWSo it works good as far as I can tell.

These LED turn signals are robust and well made. I always seem to have a hard time believing the lumen output of LED turn signals, but I think the 800 includes both bulbs, so 400 total. Otherwise, it should look like you plugged in a standard 60w bulb to the back of your car... These are bright, but they're not that bright. Being amber, they won't really achieve the same blinding light as the blue version, but I don't think blue blinkers is street legal...In any case, the housing on these is solid, which is not the case with many of the cheap bulbs out there. With others, I feel like I'm going to rip the LEDs off the base when trying to get the bulb out. This set on the other-hand is solid and well made. There even seem to be metal heat sinks built into them, which is impressive!If you're driving a vehicle not intended for LED turn signals, you are going to want to update it, either by adding resisters or swapping out the signal controller. The signal controller is the better way to go though because it actually saves power whereas the resisters do not. It may be a minimal savings, but if you're running a sound system, DVD player or other auxiliary power systems, any power savings helps.Currently going for $16 on Amazon, they're not the best priced amber LEDs out there, but there is a lot of junk being sold for more than $16 as well. I can say that these ones work and are well built.I write reviews to help others make informed decisions when buying. If you think I left something out, disagree, or have a question, please comment! I will never post a review if it is not my genuine opinion/experience. I will not be bought! As such, I did receive this product in exchange for my honest review, but I strive to review such products as if I had paid full price.

Great filter - even better with the removal nut.  Why don't more companies do this on oil filters.My factory installed filter on my 2013 Yamaha Nytro XTX was installed so tightly that it shredded when I removed it when an oil filter wrench.  I then had to hammer it off as I couldn't get enough leverage on the OEM filter to remove it.  This caused me to nick my engine block. . . absolutely ridiculous on a new machine!I have literally performed hundreds of oil changes and never had this problem in the past.  See the picture for what this filter helps  you to avoid.  Please note, you should only HAND TIGHTEN your filter thereby eliminating the need for this type of filter - but in my case, I did not install the old filter. . .the factory did.  I bought this filter for insurance on my snowmobile for future oil changes.

So "heavy duty" that it rolls up into a 3" cylinder - see picture.  This was not what I expected.  I could have bought something this quality at Walmart a lot cheaper.I guess the 1 positive is that it's so thin it will be easy to cut to size.

Great little air compressor that works and is made to be portable. I bought this in the hopes of having something easy to use to inflate car tires for the family as needed. With 5 cars it's a pain to pull out a large compressor every time you need to inflate one tire a few PSI. I tested this right away and it brought a pesky tire with a consistent slow leak from 20psi to 28psi in a matter of seconds. I'd guess it took me about 30seconds total, but that was due to having to check the psi and then reattach the compressor to get the right psi. You learn quickly that the gauge works well when it is first attached, but once it is turned on the gauge goes a bit goofy. Not sure why, even when it was off after inflating it didn't read very accurately, but upon reattchment it read right on. If possible I'd take off a half star for this. Only a half because you learn rather quickly how to compensate for the inaccurate reading. The second time I inflated this size tire I was able to get the psi Spot on to where I wanted it. Outside of that the compressor is exactly what I was hoping for. It's small, light, quiet with rubber feet on the bottom to silence vibrations, attaches quickly and it's easy get it working. Some unexpected positives:- comes in a nice canvas bag with a top handle for easy stowing and portability- compressor valve screws on to the tire valve, feels secure and you know you are doing it right- unit comes with two adapters attached onto the unitThings I hadn't thought about:- when you switch to work on the other side of the car you likely have to remove the power from the car power/lighter. Not a big deal but thought I'd mention it.- when you attach and remove the air valve it lets out a very small amount of air from the tire

Good quality and very durable appearance.... But it rusts pretty easy, I don't believe it's true powder coat but rather the wrinkle finish valve cover paint like you buy at the local auto shop. Looks like it was dropped before shipping as the bar has a splotch of yellow paint however there were no signs of packaging damage in that area, paint was chopped off the end corner, all of which are already rusty as well as around the welds where the paint isn't sealed completely. So fyi plan on painting it when you receive it. It looks amazing otherwise.

This think is very heavy.  I saw other reviewers complain about the fit, but mine slid right in perfectly.  On the firsst ride, I noticed a lot of annoying rattling every time I went over a bump.  I cut some rubber washers to fit between the ring and the pin to quiet the rattling.  I also put some rubber shelf liner inside my hitch receiver on the bottom to reduce the rattle between this unit and the hitch receiver.  Now, it is totally quiet.  Have not had an excuse to drag anything with this yet but I am sure it would up to the task.

Bought for a steal and love it. Used for Alaska dark winters and works amazing. Does not include wiring harness, buy a rigid harness for $23. Fast email reply from seller. Shipping was a little long but most likely due to me being in Alaska. Buddies are buying them up now. Pictures show stock lights alone and with ligh my bar (however it's not quite dark to show but also have it aimed low which is my fault) best deal around

First off I wanted to say I was thinking about just buying some simple green as I read on some forums to clean my filter but I felt safer sticking with the OEM stuff.  I followed the directions, sprayed it and let it soak for about 10 minutes, then rinsed with warm water followed by some compressed air and I have a Peet Boot Dryer so I put the AEM Filter on that to let it dry completley.  When I was washing out the cleaner from the filter, there was dirty water coming out of the filter, so I know it worked and my filter wasn't too bad but it needed to be done.  I SOAKED the filter with the cleaner and theres still enough product for at least 5 or 6 more times so they give you plenty.  As far as other reviewers having issues with the packaging and leaking,  I did not have that problem and it was double wrapped, so AEM or whoever must've heard the complaints and changed how they package.  Hope this helps.

Love the goggles!  My two boys take turns riding around on the new Can Am side by side ATV with my husband and the goggles are perfect! My husband made the band stretch to go around the helmet and it works like a charm to keep dust, bugs and debris away from the kids eyes.Pros1) Safety - my main concern is to avoid eye injury when the kids ride in the ATV2) Comfortable - not scratchy and it won't fall apart (not foam) and no marks around the face when you take them off3) Easy to adjust to different sizes or even wrap around a helmet4) Nice carrying case and cloth to keep safe and to clean5) Scratch resistant lensesCons1) So far, NONE.  I will update this review if they break or start to fall apart or get scratched.  I'm very pleased so far!Note: These fit on both my kids heads, so you can see they adjust down quite a bit.  Some helmets are designed differently of course.  If you're using a full head style (pictured) then you need to slide them around the outside of the helmet. I took a pic of that too.  The band is flexible enough to adjust to any needs you have to size up or down.Now that I've seen these riding goggles and tested them out, I'm ordering a second pair for my husband.  I was really happy to receive these goggles at a discounted price during a promotional period in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  Whether you're riding a motorcycle, moped, ATV or any type of moving vehicle (or a fast bike rider!) these will do the trick to protect your eyes.  To be helpful, I'll include some photos.:)

Bought these 5 hole style caps to protect the toe of my engineer boots while riding my bike. These toe caps use heavy duty steel staples to secure the top of the caps. They are not  sharp and required great force to push in until I dremeled the ends sharp. After sharpening the staples, I took a hammer and gently tapped the metal cap into place on the toe of my boot. Using a hammer to help form the cap to your boots sole will give you a better fit. I them used a punch to tap down the top staple lips further tightening, and customizing the fit. I then used a 12 in pair of channel lock pliers to get under the bottom of the cap while placing the staple in its holes on top. Using the channel locks like a vise, It didn't take very much pressure to drive the staples all the way home, deep into the boots sole. I wasn't too happy about the staples at first,(figured screws would be better) but I am very pleased with the results.

I use this for my wife's Audi A4 2015. The subscription isn't too expensive, you can purchase a week for $10 or a free month if subscribed (just remember to unsubscribe). It's still much cheaper than the vcds. Reprogrammed the needle sweep, third brake light emergency flash, keyfob door press once for all doors and other minor options. the maintenance reset and emergency brake service is well worth cost of the purchase and subscription for those that do their own maintenance.only issue is it takes time to scan, at least a few minutes. I downloaded the 1 year subscription on iTunes.

Took longer to get the old exhaust off (which was completely rusted out) than it did to put the new MBRP exhaust on. There isn't much muffling though, running the truck without and then with there wasn't much difference, better tone but not any quieter. At higher RPM cruising its pretty quiet, not much drone unless you romp on the accelerator, then it has some half decent grumble. Certainly not a flowmaster exhaust, but for price and ease of installation i'd buy it again over the $500+ flowmasters.

Great quality great look  on my 2011 dodge charger r/t but the brake pedal is definitely a pain in the but forsure but it didn't take me but an hour or 2 to get it on and if u follow the directions that come with the pedals it shows to put it in hot soapy water  which I did and it helped alot also you want to start from the top of the brake pedal get that hooked on and work your way down and around the best screwdrivers to us is the shorty screwdrivers and a skinny short one I will post pictures of what screwdrivers I used as well as a picture of what it looked like after

These are OK. Look good after installing, but the installation is the problem at least on a 2014 Wrangler. The grills were not numbered as indicated in the instructions. This was not a big problem since the 2014 grill openings measured the same size. The problem came when trying to secure the grills to the grill opening with the supplied metal pieces. The grills will not tighten without bending the metal "strips" to allow them to tighten with the 7mm nuts (the instructions say use a 4mm wrench to tighten the nuts, they are 7mm not 4mm). Be sure to use Locktite on the nuts. Locknuts would be even better. Time will tell how these hold up and if I will have to re-tighten, if I do I will go with locknuts next time. It would help on the installation if you had some help, it is hard to hold the grills, screws and put the nuts on with only two hands. On the plus side the powder coating looks good and there are no chips or bad spots and they look good on the Wrangler and hopefully will protect the radiator/condenser.

Rock solid, can't beat the price. I've been riding motorcycles for decades, and found these to work great. Where cheap bar end mirrors fail is generally the mounting hardware. To that end I have a suggestion- don't use it! Remove the "expanding bolt" thing that would normally go inside of your handlebar, and discard it. Slide your grip up the handlebar about 1/4 inch and mount the mirror right to the handlebar. Check out my photo to see what I'm talking about.

Just got it today. The cover installed fairly easily. Took longer to understand the instructions a bit but very easy once it's clear. I have a 2018 Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro with the 5' bed. This bed cover fits it very well and snug. I haven't driven around with it yet but this review is based on the Install for now.Pros:Decent quality materialsEasy installationNot heavyAll necessary hardware is includedCons:Some plastic parts (quality)small creases where it folds on the sides (appearance)Overall, I am pleased by the way this cover looks and feels. It'll keep my work parts dry and off my truck seats. I will review again if anything changes. I would recommend this product.

When I was looking for a escape hammer to mount in our RV I found this one.This escape hammer length makes it that there is enough momentum to break a car window. This would make it also easier to use when submerged. Make no mistake that when you are submerged it needs way more force. The hammer is of a decent weight, 8.3 ounces. Most other escape hammers are between 4 and 6 ounces. The combination of the weight and length helps to shatter a window easy.The cutting blade makes me wonder if it is sturdy enough to cut a seat belt easy. The cutting blade of this hammer is one of the "break off" box cutters. I think it is sharp enough but will it hold up or break when cutting a seat belt? I wish I could test it. The position of the cutter is perfect. positioning it near the hammer head prevents turning the hammer upside down when you need to use the hammer and the cutter. Many escape hammers have the cutter on the opposite side of the hammer and that is difficult to do in case you can only use one hand.My demo hammer was black, I will add some reflective tape to make it more visible if I decide to mount it in our RV.PROHeavy hammer with long handle.Cutting blade in the right spotCON:Dubious if the cutting blade is strong enough.I do my best to test the cutting blade and will revisit this review when needed. Until then I give it 4 stars and will adjust when needed.*Disclaimer*I received this product at a discount however this is my honest review.

The can I installed the kit in was a Muzzy off of a 1998 ZX9R.  Took about 45 minutes from start to finish taking the can off the bike, drilling out the rivets, removing what was left of the old baffling, installing the new screen, stainless steel wool, fiberglass, putting it back together, and installing the can back on the bike.  If you have the basic hand tools to take off the exhaust, drill with a bit (mine was 1/8"), rivet gun, sharp scissors, and a pair of gloves, it should take an hour or so max to do one can.  The sound of the bike is noticeably quieter, would recommend.  See pics for the level of damage to the existing fiberglass, which did not seem like much.

This kit is awesome! It rides so nice and the handling is amazing. It's very easy to install with simple hand tools. Definitely a very high quality kit for an excellent price. I do recommend purchasing the available adjustable front track bar and not using the front track bar relocation bracket and dropped pitman arm. I can cruise easily at 80mph with no bump steer. I also recommend using exhaust spacers to give some extra room between the front driveshaft and exhaust crossover pipe. You may also want to put a few welds where the rear track bar bracket attaches to the rear axle. I could not be happier with this kit.

I originally (foolishly) bought a set of the exact same lights for nearly $50 dollars after reading the reviews. The first set worked great but gave me my first lesson in LED strip lights...they are far more fragile than they seem! Half the lights (the leading half) didn't work.I since purchased these again at around 30 dollars and took great care in installing them. I also used the remaining working strip from the first pair as a license plate light (looks amazing!). The adhesive sticks very well! ...However, I live in arizona and the heat can cause the adhesive to become pliable and, as the strips contour my headlights, have already started to "move" a little and needed firm reapplication. They've taken one round in the high pressure car wash since and all is still well! Surely won't last forever, but as they are not permanently mounted, they make a great attention getter on my Mustang

Excellent quality Set But they should have included the Crankshaft seal aswell. That's why I deducted one star.Couple of Tips for DIYERs.* Buy a Hynes manual* Be patient and take your time.* Buy a Hynes manual.* Get the crank shaft bolt loosened from a car mechanic he would do it for 20 $ No need to spend time on loosening it yourself. Tighten it enough to  get back home.* Label every pipe, connector before taking apart engine.* Get a timing belt kit aswell if its not been changed.( Be very care full not to strip the waterpump and tensioner bolt hole it will be a PITA job then if its stripped)* Get the head machined and get the valve stem seals, back cover and camshaft seal installed from them and while its at shop Clean out the intake manifold, Water passage, Throttlebody, Fuel injectors, Pistons with a brass brush and cylinder walls with tissue papers.* When installing the sparkplug seals on the valve cover put the lip side facing towards you. And work them on the sparkplug tubes with a screwdriver don't force the valve cover to close. Otherwise the tubes will chew through seals and tubes would then fill with oil.* Inspect the PCV valve if its old then Change it. If your engine is consuming the oil then its a good idea to change this valve. probably it will fix it. If the compression is good among cylinders.

I got this can on accident when I had ordered the Industrial strength version (in a gold can.)  That's fine, because the Automotive paint is probably easier to work with anyway.  And it worked great.  I wanted to paint the bellhousing on my truck engine before putting it back in.  It's just plain old cast iron and came out of the truck with 55 years of dirt and oil on it.  The item wasn't being ruined by rust, but just looked bad.  I spent a lot of time cleaning it with engine degreaser, scrubbing it with a heavy steel brushes, and finally hand cleaning it with acetone.  Then I opened this tiny can of Rust Bullet to see what it was all about.  I have never used POR 15, but I have used all of the store-bought stuff like Rust-O-Leum and similar oil based epoxy enamel paints.  If you're like me and you're used to those products, get ready for a pleasant surprise.  Rust Bullet goes much further for your dollar.  I used maybe 1/4 of the tiny 4oz can of paint to completely cover my bell housing twice.  The paint goes on thin and covers like white on rice.  I was using a foam sponge brush and the paint made is soft and useless, so I switched to a piece of kitchen sponge to finish the job by dabbing the paint onto the surface and spreading it around.  It was very easy to work with and it was dried to a thin, solid shell within about 6 hours.  I have to say that once this stuff is on, it's on.  Acetone won't wipe it away like it does with any store bought paint.  If you get it on your skin you're going to look like the Tin Man for a couple weeks.  I wore two layers of polyurethane gloves to keep it off of myself.  It's just a pleasure to work with this paint since other brands are sticky, tacky, messy, thick, and dry with brush strokes in place, leaving you with an unwanted textured finish.  This stuff is thin and falls down into the surface and looks like a spray paint job even though you used a brush.  And it's so tough that the thin coating you get is 10x stronger than that messy, thick, oil based epoxy.  I'm never using that store bought stuff again.  Rust Bullet has converted me to a believer.  Unlike a bunch of the other reviewers, I have not been paid by the company.  I just like the product enough to extol its virtues.  I'm adding a couple of photos of my project to show the results.

Looks like good old Baldwin filters has farmed out their manufacturing to China, at least fuel filter part number BF9882. I took the plastic wrap off of mine to check and see if both O-rings were present; they were. Just a little hard to see through the top of the filter. I was disappointed about the "MADE IN CHINA" mark, and some of the reviews where installation was near impossible. I liked the cadmium finish versus a painted finish. Should resist salt spray pretty well.

I read a lot of mixed reviews on these, but decided to give them a shot anyway. I installed them with no problems to my 2004 Chevy Silverado 1500. I am thinking that there is a good possibility that some of the negative reviews are people that purchased the incorrect product. They came with no instructions, which it says in the product description if you read that far. They also included 6 threaded inserts (rivnuts) and hardware, as well as a foam "pad" to go between the mounts and your vehicle. I had 0 problems installing these. I was a bit concerned after reading the reviews, but it went super smoothly! I used a step bit to get the holes the right size before inserting the rivnuts. There are tons of videos about DIY tools and such, but I bought this one at my local Menard's for $15 :&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Surebonder-8510-6-32-8-32-10-24-10-32-1-4-20-Threaded-Insert-Tool/dp/B0003J2B5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Surebonder 8510 6-32, 8-32, 10-24, 10-32, 1/4-20 Threaded Insert Tool</a>&nbsp;It's definitely not meant for industrial uses, but for a weekend doing your own and a buddies it will work great. The last thing I did before actually inserting the rivnuts was to put a big glob of silicone in the hole and around it to help weather seal it better. They look great and are very solid. Check out the pictures.

After much exploring on the internet, I found this hardware kit for making a set of loading ramps out of 2" X 12" boards. There was a little confusion whether they included both the top hardware ends & the bottom feet hardware so I called customer assistance & was immediately helped & got my answer. I ordered them @ this GREAT price which couldn't be beat after hours of searching prices on the internet. My order process went flawlessly & I received them in our post office quickly. I bought 2 - 2" X 12" douglas fir boards 8' long & assembled my new ramps. We have delivered 6 refrigerators & can also load a riding lawn mower & a golf cart FLAWLESSLY w/ them. They are EXACTLY what I needed & work VERY WELL. Would rate these ramp hardware kits as excellent & would recommend them to anyone! I had a picture of my ramps but have no way of making a video to show. I only have my phone camera in JPEG format.

If you are thinking about relocating the license plate to the rear tire, this is what you want!  Would recommend this hands down.FYI:  You will need a plug to cover the hole that is left under the tail light after relocating.  I used "Poison Spyder Customs 17-04-112".  You will also need a light for the license plate.  I used "OFF ROAD ONLY LD-PL6 LiteDOT LitePLATE Licence plate LED light with 6' disconnectable harness" and wired it to also be used as a brake light.  It's a little pricey and requires some splicing of wires, but definitely worth it.

The Run-D off road lights are nothing short of Awesome!  These Off road lights are a little over 3 inches wide and just a shade shorter than 3" tall (without the bracket).  With the brackets they are over 3.5 inches tall.  They have 7 LEDs that are extremely bright.  They are constructed out of aluminum and look great.  The fit and finish is what you would expect from a name brand light at twice the price.  I have been very pleased with their appearance and their performance.

I purchased these air shocks for my 2005 Buick La Sabre Custom, 31,000 mile,  based on previous reviews and felt comfortable with all of the comments.  I only had problems with self made errors when I tried to secure the nut to the top of the shocks, I had the metal washer turned the wrong way, and I couldn't get the nut to start on the threads.  The washer looks upside down, and that is what threw me.  The shocks didn't look like the ones I have, until I fully extended them.  Just hook the bottom bar to something and they easily extend.  The Bore or size of the shocks looks a little larger than my stock ones.  The shocks don't come with the bottom nut and bolts, only the washers and the top nut that secures the shock mounted inside the trunk.  Two of my clips (nuts) were already broken but I was able to still use them, holding them in place with a vise grip pliers.  I too wish the bolts and nuts came with the new shocks.  Also, I placed the clip over the airline before placing it back on the Air Shock, and it snapped securely.  Much easier than trying to spread the clip after pushing the air cap on the shock, then the clip.  Looks like my Buick was raised about two inches.  We'll see how she rides on our trip next week.

Color is brighter than a vehicle painted in 1998, but that could be due to some fade over time.  The cans tips clogg up easily and splatter, so keep the tips wiped off.  Also the last couple of ounces in the car are useless because there is not enough pressure to push them out.  One last thing is they are $8.99 at the local auto parts store and i overpaid on Amazon by $6 a can.  My fault for not checking first

Installed it and found that if there's a defective one in a bunch.....I'll get it as I did. Only around 35% will burn and a few that does is dim. That's the disadvantage of on line orders... ..you must ship it  back on your expense.....they should of just ship me another one for my inconvenience.

It seems as if the auto industry is taking a half hearted approach in adopting LEDs for use in the interior and exterior of vehicles. These I ended up using for our cargo lamp and it lights up the entire trunk and more in our Subaru. Ive used similar bulbs for our backup bulbs and they will illuminate our entire driveway backing up in the middle of the night. Its not the warmest of light color but its also not the ricer blue color that a lot of cheaper options produce.These are the same fitment as the regular incandescent bulbs and much brighter, and they don't trigger any codes. Definitely makes looking for things in our car much more easy with the additional amount of light.I still have yet to see how long the bulbs will last under normal use, however I haven't had any problems with other exterior LED lights or side marker LED bulbs from the same brand. I've installed so far in my cars and I expect fairly long use out of these without the slow gradual fade of an incandescent bulb.Items shipped quickly and were packaged securely without any damage and the seller was very courteous throughout the process.I received this item at a discount and am providing an honest, unbiased review. My words are my own and I enjoy providing feedback to the Amazon community since reading reviews is imperative for me whenever I try out a product, so I believe in giving back and providing my own feedback as well.

Fit right in the old screw holes.  Busted off the old screw heads and had to drill out and use a self tapping screw to replace.  Item itself is perfect.  WAY better design than the original.

Just received the hitch carrier yesterday. I am amazed how simple and yet how strong it is. Of course, it being steel, it should be strong! Decent powder coating job as well. It's a straight forward build and install. 6 bolts, nuts, and washers. 2 support braces, and of course, the 2 inch steel spine for the hitch and carrier. Simple reflectors on the back, which you might want to replace or install better ones over. It's not going to be a flush fit into your hitch receiver so, please, don't forget to get a anti-shake hitch adapter, which only costs a few dollars. Well worth the purchase if you have a larger snowblower.Now, About the snowblower...I have an, Ariens Deluxe 30 Snowblower. It's a pleasure loading onto the bed of the truck, but, not a pleasure unloading it from the bed of the truck. It's a heavy beast. It weighs a damn near 300 lbs. I needed something to help ease my back pain and knee pain AND not try to run right over me! so this Pro Series hitch did the trick. It's 32" wide and 48" long. My Deluxe 30 is 30" wide. Now, I am not going to get a really large hitch carrier, so, removing one snow shoe from the Deluxe 30 is easier than spending more money on a larger and more dangerous hitch carrier. So, if you're like me, and have or may want a 30" snow blower, get this hitch carrier! You won't regret it!!Oh, yes... I do wish that the fabricators of this hitch carrier paid more attention to the welding of the grating. The bolt to the front left, where the reflectors are placed, had to be torque into a weld point and could possibly not seat the bolt securely. Please check into this. I managed to secure the bolt but not many have the strength or tools to do so. Thanks!Any questions?! Just ask! I'll try to reply ASAP.

Great quick install, also the instructions included were very simple to follow. I'm not a mechanic but if you can use a screwdriver you'll make it. I'm burning through gas quicker cause I keep flooring it. Pair this with the flowmaster package and they'll hear you coming and you'll feel a lil boost

These look to not have enough 3m backing tape to hold them in place. I had to hold them in place while rolling the window up. They kept falling off until I could get the windows up.After I got the windows up, I went back with a hair dryer to heat the seal. That tape usually sticks better when warm.Instructions say to not roll your windows down for 72 hours. Be prepared for that!!

Anybody who knows Ford trucks knows the one thing they're not the best at is headlights. They pretty much suck. Finally fed up with it i started lookin for a light bar i could add to the truck without lookin like a moron drivin down the road. Thank God for finding these light bars on amazon. Locally a similar light bar is going for 150+. But with all the great reviews (the picture reviews are by far the most valuable) i figured its worth a shot. Mounted it by removing the fog lights on my bumper and putting the bar in their place. Very classy and unnoticable. Obviously the only intelligent way to wire it was by adding a relay that turns the bar on and off with my high beams, NO thinking about it, its basically now a part of or mimicking the high beams. This thing is way bright. Like stupid bright! The HUGE increase in brightness, farness, peripheral vision and the good crisp white light. Ill let the pictures speak for themselves. Its really a no brainer. For the cost of these light bars the hugr increase in nighttime driving ease and safety i will not own a vehicle ever in the future not equipped with a light bar. This bar was easy to mount, came with good hardware and brackets. Heavy and well built. If your still undecided just get it. You will be most impressed. For reference i got the 20" spot/flood light bar and its on a stock 2005 Ford f350

The lights I received were not the lights as described.For a 6500 k these are almost totally blue compared to my diamond white 6000k lights.The mounting setup showed an updated Style but I received the old style brackets requiring a lot of adjustment and four bolts too tighten light to bracket..Although the lights do their job they could do a better job if they lit up brighter.Shipping was fast and product does work as described.Also the diodes are a round bubble instead of the updated flat diode...This may have been what contributed to the lack of light output.Do your homework before purchasing as this issue was not clearly marked in the picture or description..

I returned/exchanged  the first RP5-GM11 as it seemed to have loose internal connections.  The issue I want to make others aware of is the speaker hiss I experienced with both.  Both were latest versions with latest firmware.  The hiss was loud enough to clearly hear while driving along in a Hummer H2 with the radio volume turned down all the way.  The hiss is present whether the engine is running or not.  The hiss was not engine whine.My vehicle: 2003 Hummer H2, bose sound system  - OEM 6 disc head unit, bose speakers with OEM center console subwoofer, and "luxury" version of the bose amp.  The LUX amp is the digital one, and I can now advise that you should really know in advance which one you have before choosing an interface like this.  Google lux vs premium bose amp.  See attached photo (posted by another installer) We are not talking about whether or not your vehicle is a "luxury" class model or not.I upgraded my head unit to a Pioneer AVIC8200NEX.  Whether or not my new head unit wiring harness was even plugged into the RP5-GM11 module, and no matter what audio source was selected even if fully connected, I expereinced a low level hiss coming from all speakers.  All my connections were double checked, soldered, and all grounds were inspected and fine.  The hiss only went away when power was removed from the RP5 unit.  That only happened when I chose to "power off" the head unit completely.PacAudio was responsive when I contacted them.  We verified I had made connections properly.  They advised me that they tested their unit with "all trim levels" and this was the first they heard of this.  They suggested I bypass the amp.  Why buy this harness if I am going to bypass my amp?  I didn't want to spend the time or money on a new amp, or speakers either, hence the reason I bought their product.  I just wanted to integrate a new head unit.  For that matter, most head units can't put out the same power as the LUX amp, and then one has to be concerned about matching OEM speaker impedence with the radio's specs so as not to damage it.  In bypassing the amp I wouild have lost the two rear-most speakers (each have 14ohm impedance) and the OEM subwoofer as well.A search of the internet, however, revealed others with the hiss issue.Enter the GMOS-04 unit by Metra / Axxess.  I installed the GMOS (which I didn't buy at first as the RP5-GM11 seemed to have more favorable reviews).  The GMOS has an adjustable gain.  There is no adjustment for this on the RP5-GM11.What makes the GMOS better?1) That adjustable gain screw adjustment.  Again, both with and without the new head unit connected to the GMOS just like the RP5-GM11, with the gain turned all the way up, I heard the speaker hiss.  Back down the gain just a little and the hiss was gone.  Amen.  As for volume, even with the gain turned down more from where I set it, the sound was still louder than before with the OEM head unit.  I lost nothing.2) On-Star volume can be controlled directly from steering wheel volume control - with RP5-GM11, you had to pick from one of a few preset levels and have to access the module to do so.3) The GMOS is firmware upgradeable via a common micro USB cable - with RP5-GM11, you have to get some proprietary cable from them.  Why should we have to spend even more to upgrade firmware?While the RP5-GM11 may not cause hiss issues for GM owners with the "premium" non-lux amps, I would encourage anyone with speaker hiss (not engine whine) to try this GMOS over the Pac Audio product to solve the hiss issues.By the way, the GMOS was not any more complicated to install than the RP5-GM11 and I actually prefer how much better it performs.

It did however clean the wheels lolThe last picture is how they were before my wheels got dirty. I also wrapped the car 3 weeks later which is why the car is black in one picture and the grey in another.

Works excellent.  Recently replaced conductor plates on mine and my co-workers CDI.  I test fit the dipstick with the pan off (and the valve body loose) to see how much protrusion there was into the pan and took a photo of it.  You don't have to jam this thing in, just gently feed it till it hits the "stop" near the bottom of the tube.

I purchased two 20.5/8-10 trailer tires from Amazon and wanted covers.  A snug fit is better than a loose fit, but these are "tight."  Once the tires are on my trailer, they may be a bit too tight.  If I have to get another set, I'll go up one size.

well this switch looks exactly like the original OEM Nissan I have in my truck, only way to tell the difference in looks on the bottom one says switch doctor and the other Nissan Motors. It took only 5 minutes to switch these out, simple easy, the switch doctor panel does everything my OEM original did, even has the same colored lights in the switches. I gave this 4 stars as one of the rocker switches for the left rear windows is a bit stiff, nothing to be returned for, but its not perfect. So far all the switches on the panel are working great. I had to replace mine as the original OEM the right rear window would go down but not back up, seems to be a problem with these Nissan switches and mine barely lasted 4 years with very little rear window use before the problem started. No way was I gonna spend $171 on a new one here and wait 1-2 months for it to be shipped from Nissan from japan. But!! with that said lets see how long the switch doctor version lasts. I have added Pictures of the new Switch Doctor installed

These came quickly and provided an excellent replacement for the factory intake gaskets GM installed on my 4.3 Vortec. I didn't think the small tube of black silicone would be enough for the job but if you follow the maintenance manual, there is plenty to seal the horizontal front and rear of the block.

Exactly what I needed. Fits the standard rubber snap in type OEM and aftermarket 1.5" TPMS valve stems found on many vehicles. The sleeves are metal and the caps are plastic chrome which for me is preferred due to galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals (brass & aluminum). Easy to install, sleeves slid over without issue and no need for any o-rings since the caps thread all the way down to the top of the sleeve. Good product and will likely order another set for another vehicle soon.

Keep the old o-ring from the OEM pump. It was orangish/red on my car (04 330Ci). The o-ring that came with this pump was made of brittle rubber and it cracked and split in no time. My car started leaking washer fluid onto the garage floor after a few weeks of this being installed. I didn't want to believe the reviewers on other websites that it was the o-ring. I had to wait until the washer fluid reservoir was down below the pump's level to check. Sure enough, the o-ring was cracked and split all over. Thank God I kept the old o-ring.With the exception of the problem mentioned above, this pump works as expected and comes in at a fantastic price. Installation is a 2 minute job. Unplug the electrical cable, pull the pump off, release the black plastic retention clip on the outlet tube, and then pull the outlet tube off the pump.

My 2007 Toyota Yaris has original paint and C/TR code "1F8" on the door jam. The "1F8" pen isn't even sort of close to the factory Toyota paint. It's a completely different color (I'd say about 10 shades darker). See attached photo with door jam code and Dupli-Color sample.I'm a bit baffled by this since I've found Dupli-Color products to be reasonably close matches in the past. Maybe this is a bad batch.

I put these in my MK4 Jetta to replace the stock fog lights. They initially blew a fuse, but so did my new headlight bulbs. They blew one more, but have not since then. For being a small bulb, they do give a good amount of light output, and give a nice look when driving with just them on, or when you have both these and headlights on.Bottom ones are the hella yellows

I looked at several sites such as crutchfield & bestbuy to see what dash kit would fit my truck (2007 gmc sierra new body style) and they all lead back to the metra 95-3305 and i tried installing it and it set very recessed into the dash that it would not mount properly due to depth issues....i even tried modifying the kit by grinding the inside of it and it still would not fit or look proper and i even tried a scosche GM 1598AB and had the same problem. I read more customer reviews and decided to try another Brand called BestKit BKGMK318 and it fit with perfection and wish i had selected this from the start but didn't work that way so i would like to recommend anyone that has a tahoe,yukon,silverado,sierra 2007-2013...don't waste your time with metra or scosche ...the Bestkits BKGMK318 was only $9....I attached a picture of the pioneer radio installed with Bestkits BKGMK318

UPDATE 09 Nov 2017:All of my exterior lights have at least 1 bad (flickering) LED.  The lights I installed in the interior of the car are still fine, but they obviously get less use.I still have a 4 left in the box of 10 I ordered, but when they go bad, I won't be buying these again.  The OEM incandescent bulbs lasted 6 years.  These lasted 1 year.  My search for a quality LED replacement continues....The Pros:1.  Outstanding value and quality.  Cheaper than the tungsten replacements at my local auto parts store.The Cons:1. Too blue for my taste.  As parking lamps, they contrasted greatly with my halogen headlights and contributed to a custom / aftermarket look that I didn't enjoy.  I know that many "white" LEDs have a blue-ish hue, and at first I didn't mind, but after a few days it bothered me.  (see photo).  They would pair better to HIDs or LED headlights.2. Too long.  They are longer than the standard tungsten bulb and too long for some applications on my car.  While they do provide dimensions, I didn't break out my micrometer to measure the old bulb, nor did I realize that 1/8in would be a factor.  A side-by-side photo on amazon suggests they are the same size.  They are not.  Might not be an issue for your application, but beware.  (see photo)3.  Too bright (for some applications).  Sounds like a weird thing to complain about, but had these actually fit my license plate light bezels (they were too long), they would have been far too bright.  These wedge bulbs are also commonly used behind the dash or instrument cluster.  I wouldn't recommend them for that either.

Great addition to my automotive tool set. The only real complaint is that the pick isn't tapered enough to actually get under some clips. I ended up using a very small blade screwdriver to get under the clip and then use the pick or other tools to finish up. I don't know how many auto clips I have destroyed in the past not having the right tool to remove them-making me go to either an auto parts store or back to the dealer.

I will be replacing my 40" with an Auxbeam 42" and buying another 52" for my headache rack. I only gave it 4 stars because it came with some scratches and dings but it wasn't anything worth sending back for.

Bought this to accommodate several trailers I have. As one reviewer stated it is loose.  The adjustable part has a slight Bend to it. Put those two together a ball sits at an angle when mounted. The single pin that holds the locking mechanism for the adjustable part is a concern to me. If it does manage to catch on something to pull off it could be easily lost.I attached a photo where you can see when it is mounted how it sits at an angle. I didn't think take a picture of the clip that I'm referring to

Nice bar to bring the turn signals in if that is what you want. I bought this to try and have my signals clear some hard bags I had bought and mounted on my 94 Heritage Classic. I had to make a little extension for each side to clear the bags. This adjustment is of no fault of this bar though. It is because my aftermarket bags are bigger than what was originally on my bike. The bar is of good quality and the chrome is good. I am happy with it.

I bought these to replace the same plugs that came stock on my '08 Civic Coupe EX now at 97,500 miles. The old plugs looked virtually new as if they only had 2,000 miles and they probably could have gone another 100,000miles. A little of the material surrounding the Iridium post was worn away but the post was clean and the gap was still exactly .044" per the specs, just as the new ones were. So really this is a review of the same old and the new. I did feel that the throttle was a little more responsive and the idle a little smoother. Just a suggestion, when you pull the wire off of the old plug, blow the chamber out with compressed air before unscrewing the old plug. I did this and a bunch of dust flew out of the plug chamber. All that dust may have dropped onto the piston head and created problems if I did not do this first. Just a small dab of anti-seize on the new threads that you can get at the auto parts store for $1.49, don't use too much. Torque to 18 - 21lbs per NGK. otherwise, 1/2 - 2/3rd turn after snug, also per NGK.

Thought I would give this a try. The price was cheap enough. But the product is still not worth the advantage. I installed it on a larger Ford F-150. The fit was decent. It does vibrate as other people here have noted. If it provided enough additional view...which is why you and I are buying it...the vibration wouldn't be detrimental. However, the benefit is minimal. I've uploaded a photo that kinda shows the additional view behind the trailer. It is 18ft long. So it's not very large. As you can see, the view is not improved very much.Here's my advice...save your money and spend it on some OEM extension mirrors made for your vehicle. Yeh, you'll spend a lot more. But the benefit will be a lot more.

Great product. Didn't care much for the gold colored bowtie on my Tahoe, and this made it really look better. Just make sure to follow instructions. Plan on where to make your cuts beforehand, thoroughly clean, make sure there are no bubbles or creases, use the hair dryer trick, and at first glance you wouldn't know it didn't come from the factory.

These tires are awful. They're loud and get terrible mileage. They ride rough with a bunch flexing under load. The tires are a "flotation" style and love to wander following every rut in the road and even on air bags feel like your driving over railroad crossings at every seam  or pothole in the road.The real problem I have with these tires is that they FAIL! All four of the tires on my pickup failed. The tread separates from the casing and a huge bulge appears causing vibrations. If you don' t realize it they will blowout and the entire tread will peel off. I have had five of these and four of them did this all around the 15,000 mile mark with 75 percent tread life left. I think the compound they"re made of is maybe softer causing the loud road noise and increased temps at highway speeds. After having 3 fail in one weekend  400 mile road trip ( within a 24 hr period) ,4,000 dollars damage to my truck and one very stressful emergency stop on the freeway I was told by a major tire  retailer (LS) that these are known to have issues and some customers have purchased them and then returned them. I would never buy them again. They would probably be ok for a dedicated off road rig but I wouldn't trust them at highway speed or for highway use. I replaced them with Mastercraft tires which I am told are made by Cooper tires. They have a similar tread pattern and are 3x as quiet . The cost per tire is comparable and my mileage has increased as well. Under no circumstance could I recommend these tires.

Bought this product twice, first time was going well until the white led would flash for no reason even though everything was installed perfectly. So since I thought it could've been a random defect I bout another one which worked great, until winter came. Since salt is known to destroy any metal which is exposed on this product, I completely forgot how exposed the plug-ins to the stock unit were, so winter is almost over and the turn signal started blinking fast and I checked the lights. From the pictures i posted with this review you can see the first units i bought which are in perfect condition but had a random malfunction where the white led wouldn't stay on at full brightness which I installed over the summer. The second unit is the replacements which I installed before fall. As you can see the rust buildup either from the salt or just regular water corrosion. I'm hoping they fix this product by improving the weather-proofing at those rusted ends.. besides that they worked great but sadly I won't be buying these again, 2 stars. Also the stock plugs(which hold the regular orange bulb) were destroyed so I had to replace them.

I have a 50cc Genuine Roughhouse Sport.  Based on the measurements, I thought the large would be too big, so I ordered the medium.  My bike, when covered, sort of looks like the bike in the main photo, when covered, except a bit more of the wheel, etc., is showing and my rear mirrors are yanked down every time, without fail.  I think this is also why my kickstand and any other exposed metal starts to rust a bit from the lack of coverage. If I ever buy a cover again, it will be a large, even if there isn't a basket attached - to ensure full coverage.The upsides:  The double thick panel by the exhaust pipe really does stand the test of time and the hot pipe.  I can cover it right after riding for a few hours and there are no burns.  I think this is my favorite part.The material also appears to be stain resistant.  Granted, I am a pretty clean person, but it stays outside, it is exposed year-round to the Colorado elements.  It still looks pretty clean.The downsides:  Near the rear of the seat where the hem tapers to a corner of sorts, the thread started coming loose about three months in.  There is a hole there now - a small hole, one that doesn't really affect the coverage on the bike other than what is mentioned above, but it is disappointing.  The stitching is cheap.  The hole showed up past the amazon return window so I couldn't send it back for a different one.No patch kit comes with the cover. I give three stars mostly for the stitching/hole and the slightly small size. I'd give it four if it weren't for the hole, five if the sizing recommendation was accurate and I got the right size for my scooter.I dropped it to two stars because there is supposed to be a Limited Lifetime warranty on this item, according to the Amazon description, which is part of why I ordered this item versus one that did not have a warranty.  I wrote Amazon's warranty e-mail to find more information and no one wrote back.  I went to the Dowco site and I do not see limited lifetime anywhere.  When I click on warranty, it mentions paying $10 for an exchange within 30 days of receipt.Overall, I do not recommend this cover.

this sticker has made more people look at my car then any other sticker I have and I always get the same response.... laughter sometimes with disapproval sometimes they show that they agree. either way I love it and agree with what it says. its always fun to see people looking at it. Ialso it really sticks!!! NOT ONE LETTER HAS COME OFF IN OVER A YEAR!!!!!!!! so this thing is very sticky. the sticky side is on the back so it will be on the outside of your car.

Easy install and cured my 01yz250f of random stalling  and difficulty of starting cold or hot. Awesome customer service on boyesen part if you are unable to fine tune your bike just call them up and they will walk you through tuning and jetting to get the most out of your bike. I've tried the o ring mod and this is hands down a better way to go.

Easy to install.  I didn't have to remove my wheels.  Just turn the wheel one way, then finish up with the wheel the other way.  Secure and fit great on my 2015 Ford F350 Platinum (with no extended fender flares).  I also put the rear set on - very easy as well.

Who even owns cassette tapes anymore?  With this set of tools it makes it easy to replace those old stereo decks with an updated version. They are easy to use and the quality of the material is extremely strong and durable.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I have received no instruction on writing this review and the opinions expressed our 100% mine. Thanks

This product seems to be a nice top layer over dynamat. It makes it look like a nice clean finish since it's a large sheet. I am unsure of how well this product works as I installed Dynamat underneath and new larger speakers at the same time; I have no 'before-after' in mind. I purchased this to use on top of Dynamat in hopes it will insulate my truck a bit better during winter and summer. It's not cold/hot enough to see how much longer the truck holds heat or cool air. I'm sure it helps prevent panel-to-door vibration but other than that I will have to see.For my truck this (1) one package covered a single door (purchase another sheet if doing both left+right doors). The remainder isn't enough to do anything but patch jobs in other places. It was also very hard to work with as it didn't want to cut as the material wanted to absorb the force from my blade. The paper backing also ripped easily making it time consuming to get it off. This material is not like dynamat where you can peel it up some to continue removing the backing, as it wants to stick much more and is not as structurally strong. It will rip if too much force is applied or if pressure is put on spots that have been cut (i.e. corners of cuts, or where the material hasn't been cut all the way through).The foam is of high quality and the sticky backing is very nice as well. The foam seems to be bouncy and returns to it's shape quickly. The sticky backing is strong enough for it to stay stuck well, but not strong enough where it'll rip itself or the material underneath it. It's great to use in other places that may have two panels rubbing together as it squishes and is soft. From what I can tell after installing the Dynamat and Dynaliner my door seems to have no more squeaks or rattles(or less anyway).I used it in the removeable corner trim where the mirror attaches to the door and it seems to have killed the wind noise from that area. I have also attached pictures of my front passenger door and rear passenger door. I did not take pictures of all steps as I did each door differently and with different tactics.Used in a 1999 GMC Sierra 1500.

Fairly easy to apply, just be sure to thoroughly clean the surface beforehand.  Very visible at night, and add a little extra visual appeal during the day as well.  I'm sure there's cheaper versions out there, but I'm happy with the way this one looks, and would recommend it to anyone who also likes riding at night.

The results of this wax was pretty disappointing. It was applied with a Flex Long Throw DA polisher. It goes on easy and comes off easy. Dont get it on trim as getting it off of plastic isn't easy.  For the final results, there are easier tech waxs out there that provide better gloss, without the danger of ruining trim.  For a caranuba wax it is easy application with average results.  For direct comparisson, Collinite 915 Marque D' Elegance Premium SHOW CAR Wax,  Surf City Garage Hot Rod Protectant, Ultima Waterless Wash, and Nanoskin Shock and a few others.

This light looks awesome compared to the stock taillight.  I have a 2006 Harley Sportster 1200C and this fit my bike perfectly.  I never planned to use the turn signal part of this item so I cannot review that part.  It took me about 5 minutes to install this taillight, I simply removed the 2 screws holding the light on, unplugged the old one leaving the original chrome plate on as it was in great shape.  I then inserted the terminals into the plug to match the old light, plugged it in and used the 2 original screws to install it.  If you really want to swap out the chrome backplate it would probably take another 10 minutes to do it right.  One screw and move some wiring harnesses from the old to the new backplate, I believe the wires are even for the turn signals so it would be easy to tap into them.  Worked perfect the first try

Easy to install with existing springs plus 2 new ones which hold the pipe together and allow it to flex.  No welding required.  I actually installed this on a Massimo Hisun (Yamaha Rhino knockoff).  It does sound slightly louder than stock, but silencing devices are sold separately.  Don't really notice a change in performance.Update: 6/24/2017This thing is super loud.  I meant to update this sooner.  In the deer woods, people can literally hear me coming from miles away.

I got a couple of these that came with no paperwork or instructions other than the simple diagram on the back.  Green leads on the CT are a bit on the short side.  Other than that, its pretty simple.  No buttons or switches to deal with.  Either they work or they don't.  Both of the ones I ordered work as expected.I designed a plate to be 3D printed and mounted in a square electrical box.  The model is here [...]

This is the same as the Tyger Tonneau.  For the price, it should be a 5 star, but since it's not perfect, I take one off.  This was about the easiest to install product that I have done in a long time.  4 clamps and you're done.  I had to adjust the clamp angle as it was too narrow, but maybe with a 30 minute initial install, this one will be about 5 to 10 minutes to remove or install.  Not sure of the longevity of this product in constant sun, but my truck is a garage queen so it should last.  I didn't use the foam tape that came with it and I'm not really sure of its purpose.  The rubber seals look like they seal well enough unless you are driving through a hurricane and then all bets are off.  Time will tell with this one, but I'm pretty happy for the price.

When I bought this it was labeled 6-50v input and 5v output.  My original use was just with 12v batteries so it never gave me any trouble.Recently I put this on a 36v battery that had a voltage of 41.36 volts.  POP!  It exploded.  Amperage was not a problem because the 20g wiring was just fine.Now I see that the new ones are labeled 12v input.  Good thing because that's all they are good for.

Bought these as my second choice for replacing all of the 921 bulbs in my camper (42 of them) and chose these over&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/AUTOUS90-20-x-RV-Trailer-T10-921-194-168-2825-42-SMD-12V-Backup-Reverse-LED-Warm-White-Lights-Bulbs/dp/B018XIRLDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AUTOUS90 20 x RV Trailer T10 921 194 168 2825 42-SMD 12V Backup Reverse LED Warm White Lights Bulbs</a>&nbsp;. While I feel that these work great as an overhead light, use as a reading light would be annoying. So, any light above a chair or the bed got the LED's mentioned above. All of them worked. All of them were the same color. Best installed by someone with strong fingers because they are a tight fit into the socket. They all come to life bright and right away, even in 11 deg Fahrenheit. I'll be ordering more to finish the LED conversion. The pic I posted really doesn't do justice as to how bright these are. I'm getting old and like to see, thank you very much.

These lights are the answer to your dull pick up truck reverse lights. They come packaged well and did not have any dents dings or scratches on them when i received them from kawell. Along with this there are no extra parts needed to mount them, you simply cut out the squares in your bumper, slide them in, and bolt them and wire them up. they are perfect for anyone that tower a trailer and has a hard time getting the truck close to the hitch. If you wire them in to your existing reverse lights they give you better peace of mind when backing out in crowded parking lots as well. with the low price, high quality, and awesome bright leds you can't go wrong with a set of these lights. very well done kawell. five stars!

They are individual metal letters with bad White foam double sided tape pulls off quite easily. They match factory font and size. Remove the tape that comes with them and use 3m automotive mounting tape Oh, they are hollow backs so you will need at least two tape layers on each letter. Take your time and apply the tape to the letters properly you will be very happy with these letters after this slight modification. They really show off the front of your vehicle with the contrast compared to the chrome emblem. They also make good replacement letters. Use a ruler and DRY ERASE marker to draw a line to keep them lined up. use 2mm spacing.

I bought these fully aware that they could rust or get filled with water.  they aren't too bad.  came together in one big box.  no dents,  no missing hardware.  each bar is wrapped in different color plastic and labeled accordingly.  Same with the brackets.  had them hand tightened in about 30 min.  I did watch some you tube videos, though, so i knew what i was getting into.  I had enough room for mudflaps.  maybe a 1/2" gap.  Hardware and brackets seem pretty sturdy.  They mount into preexisting holes in the body that are covered by tape at the factory.  All hardware matched for me.  nothing labeled wrong.  If your truck was setup for factory side steps,  all holes will line up,  but your truck will already have a threaded insert at one hole, so you would need a different bolt for that one.  my was not setup up for factory, so i was good.  Now on to the design flaw that is probably causing the rust and water for everyone.  1st the plastic steps.  They are not sealed well enough.  underneath the steps,  the metal is bent inward,  the steps the are connected to the bottom of this "dent" with rivets and plastic rods molded into the back of the step.  while this keeps the plastic step in place.  it is not airtight.  i have no doubt in my mind that if water is present, that water works its way in there.  especially at driving speeds when it is raining or wet and even the car wash. since it has nowhere to go.  the steps slowly fill up with water.  I, hopefully,  fixed this by prying up the plastic step a little bit and forcing some "great stuff"  expanding foam insulation to waterproof it.  only had the steps a couple of weeks,  but have already got a ton of rain.  time will tell.  the other flaw,  the hardware that attached the bottom of the sidestep to the bracket.  potential water entry there.  I just put a rubber washer under the other washers.  hopefully that prevent water from that.  As for hardware rusting complaints.  haven't had long enough to notice.  As long as the black brackets, stay black,  i honestly could care less if the bolt heads rust a bit.  they are under the truck.  out of sight, out of mind;)

I installed this fresh out of the box and it is no good. My wideband gauge showed me it was running crazy rich. It would stabilize for a second around 14:1 (where it should be) then creep into a crazy rich mark and continue doing this over and over. I checked the sensor output and it was very low output and frequency of signals. I've attached the graph showing this sensor (the flat line, the dots indicate every time it sends feedback. Notice there is one every 5 seconds) then another new sensor (much more active signals) I had to buy locally to replace it. It's either a low quality batch or maybe got banged around? My suspicions is it was a crap sensor. It didn't throw a code either...at least not in the short time i installed it and was diagnosing it. If not for my wideband and scanner I would not of known. The last graph shows the fuel trim getting rich in increments until it would jump back to 14:1 or so when it would get a signal from the sensor.

Fit the brackets then test fit as they don't look like they fit until they get spred apart buy slipping on the brackets. Fit perfect, glue rubber to fenders first then install then pull tape to glue to car. That is the hardest part, took one hour.

I'm not sure where the disconnect lies with all the negative reviews for Chemical Guys Jet Seal. I just used it on my Harley FLSS with Olive Gold Denim finish and it works just fine. I used the Meticulous Matte sealer spray first, wiping down all the matte surfaces. After this I applied the Matte Jet Seal with a microfiber towel, let it set for 20 minutes as directed then lightly buffed off with a clean microfiber towel. The finish looks great, it really brings the Matte luster to life. I didn't get these white swirl streaks that so many people complain about, and it's not that difficult to buff off. Anyway, I like this product so far, we'll see how well it protects in the long run. My photo is right after I finished the final buffing after application of Jet Seal Matte.

I got an check engine light and found it was the upstream o2 sensor. The dealer wanted way too much and Advanced auto wanted nearly 60 dollars more for this part. Amazon once again had the best price! Denso is a good quality product and it fit perfectly in my Elantra!To get the actual sensor off I did have to remove my heat shield. I used some PB Blaster to get the shield and part off and it was smooth. Check out some of the pictures I attatched to the product for more info. Also contact me if you have any issues. It was very simple to do!

Works very well on paint that has brake dust or rail dust but I also love using it on neglected wheels. First clean the wheels then spray some iron x on and watch them turn purple as the chemicals do there thing. A minute or two after spraying I like to use a wheel brush and gently agitate the iron x. After another minute rinse away.

This is a review of the Fuse Tap Set by Lumision.Summary  This is an excellent device if you want to quickly add a dc accessory to an available mini fuse port on your vehicle.  My vehicle has dc outlets that are always on. I wanted to add a dc outlet that is only on when my vehicle was on for a dash camera.  I ended up using a heated seat fuse as this fuse was only on when the vehicle is on and since it was not being used as my vehicle does not have that feature.I am using this with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SMAKN-12V-5A-Female-Car-Cigar-Cigarette-Lighter-Socket-Plug-Connector-Adapter/dp/B00RT5TE5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SMAKN 12V 5A Female Car Cigar Cigarette Lighter Socket Plug Connector Adapter</a>to make me an extra outlet for my camera.This fuse tap feels well made. It has one fuse to protect the line feeding the fuse tap and a secondary fuse to be matched to the device you are connecting this with.  The fuse you install which is closest to the metal prongs is the fuse for the line and the fuse slot that is in line with the red cable is the one you put the fuse in that matches your device you are using.To use, simply install the two fuses which match the ratings you need, crimp or cut ending off to solder your device positive cable to this free standing red power cable and plug the fuse tap in. Could not have been easier if you ask me.Note  The Black cable of your device should be directed to a solid ground on your car such as the metal frame.It was also nice that they included some fuses so that did not end up being an extra purchase. Included fuse sizes are 5, 7.5, 10, 15 and 20 amp.Very happy with this and it is doing exactly as I needed.As with all my reviews, I will update this review should this item develop any issues with ongoing use.

I had these on my vehicle and the lug key broke while changing out a flat- not once, but on 3 different subsequent occasions. The second and third occasion I had to go through McGard's customer service department to order replacement lug keys at approximately $15 (plus shipping if you want it expedited otherwise expect to wait 2 weeks).  In the end, it was a waste of my money, time and effort. Three keys breaking like this in about as many months with the last 2 being ordered back-to-back at an additional costs to me. On top of it their customer service doesnt even care that they may have a quality control issuecrazy! Short version is I decided to break the lug locks off manually, without further playing around with any of their cheap keys.Now some may wonder about the lug locks being put on too tight, however that was not the case. I tighten all my lug nuts and lug locks by hand with a torque wrench. In this particular application, specs call for 135 ft-lbs per lug nut, however with the lug locks I go much less at 90 ft-lbs (as a precautionary measure).My conclusion is the metal they are using for these lug keys are of cheap grade, and too malleable for its purpose (you can be judge from the pictures). My belief is they quite possibly have a quality control issue in their production machine shop and or the manufacturing of these for it to be a repetitive problem as I experienced.My advice, if you must have lug locks, I highly recommend you go with the spline type.

It looks like a helmet....but probably will not last very long or even worse fail to protect child in a crash.Came in original display box without any padding to protect the helmet inside the box during shipping, was expecting some over box with packing material.The helmet itself fits my child, but quality of the helmet is really poor.1) Paint of the helmet is a faded rose/orange mess. We ordered a red/white/black star helmet2) no clear coat...paint is soft and my quick finger nail scratch test took off the paint3) Had a fairly bad plastic smell but after a few days leaving it out to dry in the sun seem to help4) Quality is poor...plastic trims around the openings are already coming loose..5) lining was all shifted and bare foam look crushed in some spots.6) not really sure if the "company" tested to DOT standards or just placed the DOT sticker on. DOT regs require information on LOT, manufacturing date and certificate number for the company.Overall it's a helmet...maybe for display or customs...but for me I don't want to use it for actual riding. Reason I bought this helmet is because of the weight compared to other full face helmet.

I really don't know what to think about these bulbs. I know that all LED headlight bulbs aren't made the same but the one thing that i noticed was a dark spot in the middle of the beam on both sides. After trying to adjust the bulbs I noticed that the spots just weren't going away. I contacted customer support and they asked me to take a unscrew a certain screw and it should work. When that didn't work they asked for me to submit pictures of the dark spots and I did exactly what they asked. I figured by the decent reviews that this product would be worth getting. But by the customer support and the lights, I'll probably never buy from this company again. This truly does suck, if you want quality, I suppose that you really do have to spend serious money on it.

Wow!  First of all, the price is amazing. However, the price made me suspicious of how the quality would be.  No worries as soon as I opened the box. These are gorgeous!  So stylish and well made. Installed in less than 2 minutes. Perfect fit in my 2004 Lexus RX 330.  I really thought hard about what color to get and took a chance on the Black & White. I love it !  They look great over my light Grey leather seats.  The best part for me is that they do not slide around at all when getting in and out of the car.

These were originally purchased to add more lighting to my truck bed LED that was already installed from manufacture. I will get to installing them, but at the moment, ended up using them to light up my engine bay on my Silverado. Don't know why it doesn't have lighting under the hood.Anyways, these fit perfectly in some pre-drilled holes in the support bar above the radiator. Coupled it with a rocker switch(5amp fuse inline) and 2 of these light up my engine bay, see attached pictures. Can't believe how bright these things are!Might pick up some more and see what else I can use them for.. haha!

On the one hand, there's not much to say is this is just a giant hunk of metal. I'm writing this review, because I had seen some comments and I had the same concern as to whether this would fit the 2017  Ford F-250 (due to profile of the metal edges/corners etc.)  That silly adapter drove me bananas with the way it rattled around.  On mine anyway, it fit perfectly,  and overall very happy with the product.

Exactly what I needed and expected. While a harness like this may be intimidating to the inexperienced, it is a familiar setup for the experienced user/installer.Enough wiring to customize installation and still remained manageable. Very simple setup that is basically universal. You can make it work with most 12V lighting accessories.I replaced the switch in order to use OEM mounting positions in the dash.

I am on my 3rd box. I completely did my Silverado crew cab and now going to do my sons trk. This material is the best when comparing price. The extremely expensive material might out perform it in a lab, but you would be hard pressed to tell the difference in a vehicle. To the guy that said this is a rip off, pretty sure you got a box that someone returned and scammed Amazon. This material is legit(that is a cool word).NOTE: People, this material is NOT intended to lessen the db's in a vehicle. This material is to absorb energy(sound waves). Listen to the reviews "no more rattles" "sound is cleaner". This material is to make sound waves from your speaker enjoyable to your ears. Put in on doors where there is a speaker....the metal won't rattle or vibrate and that's because this material ABSORBED it. I'm trying to explain the difference between deadener and dampening, big difference

These are nice OEM quality. The wheel emblems did not fit my 1996 BMW 328is. From what I understand they will fit if you currently have the 70mm wheel caps. Mine has the 68mm wheel cap which has a gray plastic ring around the outside edge. The newer 70mm cap has a chrome outer edge. Besides that these are really nice.

Update: looks like I'm back to the chamois. Both towels lost it's jazz after 4-5 washes.Will buy again and again! By far the best drying towel on the market. I have noticed the small terry strings are coming lose from snagging sharp edges of trim but other than that, it holds up well. I use one towel for my black SUV. I like to use a spray wax or quick detailer while it's wet to help with water marks and drying process. I love this towel!

Glad I got these lights - I was hesitant at first, read many reviews from other kits, very happy with these. The biggest surprise is the kit came with a template, that was awesome and huge help. I think they look great (wife doesn't get it  :-)  ) and would recommend. Check youtube for videos on how to install similar kits and you'll be fine.

Filter works flawlessly on my Honda Prelude. It is a pain to install one on a Prelude but they last for pretty much the life of the vehicle as long as you treat your car well, like not running it out of gas or extremely low on gas. My old filter was perfectly fine when I replaced it with this but since I am rebuilding the entire car, I figured I might as well do the fuel filter too since it was less than 20 bucks.

There's a reason I'm leaving a 2-Star review. It's because there are reviews from at least two years ago complaining about the stupid (and redundant) sticker on the top of each filter. The stickers are redundant because the same logo is stamped in the top cap of these filters.So in two years, you'd think that the complaints would be relayed to the manufacturer, and the stickers would stop being installed. Nope.The stickers are a pain to remove. It took about 30 minutes to scrape off the stickers and get all of the residue off. I could've installed them and been 25 miles down the road already if these didn't come with the stickers (like as advertised).

See my photos with red & yellow cans.I installed 2 of these, one in each of my No Spill 5 gallon cans because the cans were cracking from the pressure and temperature changes overnight when they collapse and cause folds and kinks in the plastic.I had tried pushing the button to vent them but it was never enough and then tried unscrewing the spout overnight but found myself and employees sometimes forgetting to tighten the spouts and would spill gas.I read replacement vent cap reviews on Amazon and settled on these aluminum caps based on the higher number of successful installations.ProsThey don't leak on MY "No Spill" brand cans.Well made with precise, sharp edges. The sharp edges on the inserted portion help them grip and seal on my thick No Spill cans.Will outlast the cans and should be transferable to another can.ConsO-rings swell up if they get gas on them, because they use the wrong (cheaper) O-rings.The sharp edges on the cap cut into the O-rings when they swell up with gasoline and then will not close and only then will leak during transport.Employees don't use their brains or pay attention to their surroundings or to details (in general) and don't close vents.If the Pops-A-Vent manufacturer would use the proper O-ring I would rate it 5 stars.After an emoyee left a vent open during transport, gas leaked out the vent and the O-ring swelled up and the vent could not be closed. Of course he didn't try to fix it or say anything and just left it open and gas leaked all over. I noticed and tried to solve the problem immediately. I had to let the O-rings dry out for a few hours in order to reinstall the caps and had to insist they employee not use the vents except overnight. The vents really are NOT needed EXCEPT overnight. I find the No Spill cans vent plenty quickly on their own.InstallationThe instructions tell you to install them high on the back avoiding the handle but, No Spill cans are mostly "handle" on the back in any practical location. I decided high on the back corner between the two handles to keep them farthest and highest from the spout but was worried about wall thickness.A half inch drill bit, as instructed, didn't quite drill a large enough hole in either No Spill can to insert the vent. I tried really hard to install them as shown in the instructions to no avail and thought I would ruin the cans so, I had to carefully wallow out the hole with the side of the drill bit and carefully ream the inside of the hole. It's important to use a sharp drill bit for the cleanest hole then decide if you need a slightly larger drill bit, if you have one.Install the vent with a screwdriver as shown and rock the vent it circular motions to seat it well and it's done.I don't know if the plastic vent caps would fit the No Spill can but think they would be easier and faster to use.

They both worked quite well on my 1999 Honda Accord. I didn't do the test on my 2016 Altima because I clean and wax/quick wax it regularly, where as this Accord probably hasn't been shown love for over a decade.Both the California Gold and Turtle Wax Speed Compound work similar. The Clay bar system is what I prefer. It is a lot easier to glide the clay bar with the lubrication. The Speed Compound uses friction, therefore some more effort is put into it. I didn't see a difference until I lifted the tape. See for yourself. I didn't put in too much effort doing this test but as you can see, with the couple of minutes I did put in, it made a difference in whatever clear coat or paint this Accord has left. I've provided pictures of the Clay bar on my Altima as well with the Quik Wax.The Liquid wax is great, I use it when I foam and pressure wash the car and the Quik wax after I waterless wash my car. The Quik wash reminds me of a Kool-Aid scent. Overal the wax products leave my Altima nice and shiny. Water glides right off and beads up nicely for both of the Meguiar's Waxes.I've added a water test for the Accord, the water sticks because the paint itself is a little rough due to the car being almost 20 years old.

Installing these were super simple on my '16 Chevy Colorado.  Many good install hints in the reviews here helped.  You simply back the screw out of these, angle the bottom of the plastic backing and metal backing plate into your mount point, then tip the top portion of the backing in, pull the ring out to draw the backing plates tight, then thread the screw back in.  Don't overtighten the screw.  Boom - done. After the first two, the rest went quickly.

It took me about 45 minutes from start to finish.  I recently had my oil changed at the dealership, and they were going to charge me $80 for a Throttle Body Service.  My car is a 2006 Toyota Corolla, so I was able to find DIY videos on how to clean it myself. The work looked pretty simple and I enjoy saving money!  Spent only $8.60 on this spray can of CRC Throttle Body & Air Intake Cleaner.  After testing the engine and driving for 10 minutes after cleaning, my car felt like it had a smoother push when I press on the gas pedal.  Now I realize how much difference it makes to keep up with the maintenance! I included photos and a video for those who want to save money. Women can do this too!!!

Oh and the side that was cool went on like cake work. Been on a while and no fade so far.

I am not happy with these mats, they have curled up around the edges, don't stay in place, and basically are no better than the cheap ones you can buy anywhere for a tenth of the price. I used Husky mats before, and will be replacing these poorly designed mats for Husky in this vehicle. It is a shame, the WeatherTech mats in the front are pretty good.Seriously, these mats don't stay in place, and have curled up on the edges, they provide very little protection to the carpet, and look awful. Pass on these, even if you think the price is just too good. You will be disappointed with them.This may seem like a petty issue, and if I had bought a set of cheapo liners it would be, at $100 I expect more, and so should you. These liners are sold as a premium item for those who are willing to pay extra for the best, keep that in mind as you consider this product.

Now that I have it in hand, I realize there really isn't much to it. I also realize this really works best as a way to hold standard size coffee mugs, as it's not nearly heavy enough to securely hold anything much taller.The plastic is a little less than a 1/4 inch thick. The bottom diameter is just shy of 2 and 1/2 inches wide and two inches deep. The top is roughly 3 and 3/4 inch in diameter and 3 inches deep.The bottom is hollow which is unfortunate because I feel if it was weighted it would stay in place a lot better. All together, I can't imagine this thing weighs more than a couple ounces.With a filled McDonalds cup inside it, the drinks weight causes the lightweight unit to lift when making sudden stops.  In the picture I provided, you can see where the bottom pulls up in the back as the weight of the cup forces it out. I'm hoping this won't be an issue with the larger diameter cups I get from places like IN and OUT though since they may fit more snugly in the unit and are otherwise too wide to fit in the cup holders of my 2002 Accent.Sadly, my cat mug won't fit but I have some more standard size coffee mugs that do. My contigo thermos also fits, but it suffers from the same issue as the mcdonalds cup.I think the manufacturer could improve this by adding two things: a weighted bottom and rubberized or foam sides to allow for a more secure and snug fit inside your cars cup holder. I'm going to try to add these things myself and will report back in 2099 after I've finished all the other extraneous tasks on my list.

I picked up a set of these thin lights in 2010 to go on an 02 Ford Escape 4x4 that we use as a daily driver and to tromp the old logging roads in the Oregon Cascades. Once mounted to a Carr Light Wing on the Escape these lights look good without the cheesy plastic covers, although we do still use the covers during winter to avoid damage due to cinder or other road debris kicked up from other vehicles. The lights' output is no better than a regular 55w headlight bulb so upgraded bulbs and wiring harness is suggested. These lights are still working after six years, although the covers' black lettering has faded significantly due to weathering and UV exposure. If I were looking for another set of slim lights I may consider another set of these. 4/5 stars.

Plenty of wiring needed to mount a bar/flood lights in the front aspect of your vehicle. However if wiring to the rear, you will need more wire to reach it.Installation was smooth and worked great until I had to unplug the wires so I could permanently mount the switch. When I unplugged them, one of the prongs broke off! Now I am left 99% finished with non working lights!Am contacting the seller for assistance...

Amazing product.  Used it on the header pipes of my 1960 BMW R60.  Lots of elbow grease required!!!!!!  I started by hand but then after watching some YouTube videos pulled out the small palm sized orbit sander with a foam applicator.  Worked fantastic, less wear and tear on my fingers, hands and elbows.  I'm giving it 4 stars only due to the fact that Blue Job should make this into a paste for you.  You're making it into a paste on whatever type of applicator pad your using, so why just not make it easy and sell it in a paste form.  Somewhat of a pain in the butt playing with the powder and water...........  But, this stuff really does work!!!!!!!  The attached pics are from this weekend.  Before and After.............

Opened up the box and the part was broken. Because we needed the part and couldn't wait a week to exchange it, we had to use it as is. It works, but that's beside the point. The one problem with purchasing parts from Amazon is that they can come broken like this, and there's not much you can do about it except wait........and wait.........and wait, for it to go in the mail, back and forth. When you have a time sensitive job, that just won't work. In this case, saving a few dollars wasn't worth it. It would be nice if Amazon would credit us a few bucks for shipping a broken part.

This remote is an exact match to my factory 2004 GMC Yukon XL Denali's remote! I read the reviews, but it took me about 5-6 minutes to program my new remote...(be aware) because once I went through the steps, my new remote wouldn't program or let's say I thought it wouldn't. All the steps was completed & my remote seemed to have been programmed, but the remote wouldn't lock or unlock... Until I figured that it was a possibility that the new remote's battery was dead from sitting for so long.... like years b4 it was purchased, so I switched batteries... putting my brand new battery from my old remote n2 my new remote I ordered & it worked like a charm!! The lock, unlock, & panic buttons all work!... So b4 u think it needs to be programmed by the dealership, PUT A NEW BATTERY N2 YOUR NEW REMOTE!! I tried switching batteries back again once more just to see if the battery that came in my new remote was dead... it was indeed dead!! So I put the new battery back n2 my new remote & #ThumbsUp... the battery # is (CR 2032) ...Very easy to program! Avoid dealership costs!!!! I added pics of my old & new remotes.

Thank you, for the quick delivery to Amazon or Kohree, they light has been installed yesterday, I tell you this thing is pretty powerful, we will have a rain on Thursday and wait to check if this hold the thunder :) I love it I used 2 of them on the vowel windshield, it's a killer.One thing , if you use a short TRD Antenna next to it, the light kill the frequency when you turn them on your radio stops working, but this is due to the antenna not the lights. you have to keep the original Antenna or not install the light next to it.Flaws:ok finally it did not hold the rain so here is the picture of the light got water in it 22 days ago with rain and still is wet.

I went for a ride and it is quieter than my 3/4 HJC helmet. Only has two air vents in the top and not sure how thats going to work out in the south. But, you can remove the liner and ear pieces to clean them unlike the cheap 3/4 HJC I have. I added some reflective decals and a Sena blue tooth and I am ready to go and still stay in touch with the family.My son has an Arai full face helmet that I wear when I ride his sport bike and I like the HJC IS-MAX BT better for field of view. The Arai has more vents and is cooler. The HJC has a tinted visor that you extend with a slide on top. Only one setting, full. Press a button and it retracts pronto.Amazon sent me the wrong HJC IS-MAX BT helmet, twice. It did not have the blue tooth panel (for Chatterbox blue tooth) and the top was not the same as the small my wife ordered. I ordered the same item from another seller (fulfilled by Amazon) and it was the same as the picture and a keeper. The tinted visor retracted slower on the two I sent back than on the  IS-MAX BT one I kept.

I painted mine first and the result is stunning. Not only that, previously l had expensive fiberglass side skirts that got cracked in time while these are flexible and as close to destruction proof as one can get.I also noticed how well road debris are kept under the car as well as lots of road noise.One thing to seriously keep in mind is this, once the area is totally clean prior to mounting the skirts, beware, once the adhesive touches anything, it's on for keeps.I mean how can it hold fast to the car IF it also has to let go when you want it to? IT WILL NOT EVER LET GO...unless you did not clean the undercarriage well enough.

I have used Black Magic for the last 2 years and its a great product if you know how to properly apply it and remove it.  The shine an protection are almost unbeatable.  When I use this first thing I do is wash the car using two bucket system with some Meguires Gold Class car wash. Then dry the car with micro fiber towels, once this is done you have to prep the paint using a clay bar and some detailer spray (I use clayluber and chemical guys light clay bar); wiping the car in sections.  Once the car has been clayed I use a bucket of water (mixed with about 4 ounces of smartdetail spray and a microfiber towel to wipe  down the car a second time.  Then I apply Meguires Paste Cleaner Wax or Klasse All in One to the entire car using a microfiber applicator.  One the car has hazed I remove all the wax that is on the car.  Then I get the Black Magic Wax and I spray my applicator with a little smartdetail spray to lube the applicator, and then the Black Magic goes on super easy.  I do one panel at a time and immediately wipe it off (wipes off with no effort at all).  Once the car is completely done, I go over it a spray bottle filled with plain water and a micro fiber towel to get rid of any dust or residue that might be on the car and omg the shine is incredible.  People ask me at least once a week how I keep my car so shiny. I do this once every three months and in between waxes I just use Smart Detail spray.  The car will bead water with ease.

I put a 4" lift on my 2008 JK, and needed a way to get in and out easily without taking ground clearance away with nerf bars. It takes a second to figure out logistically how to install these, as far as which bolts to tighten first, but really very easy install. It took me about 15 minutes for both,  and it's a great addition to my 4 door JK.  I prefer these to the material grab handles that everyone else seems to use because these are literally part of the frame once tightened. They are both out of the way, but in a perfect position to pull yourself up into a lifted jeep. They also look great.

The nissan logo on the front grille of my maxima came off and a new one cost around $40. After several protests from my wallet, I decided going against buying the nissan logo and bought this one. Its now on the front grille of my maxima and looks really cool. Spray some automotive enamel on this bad boy before sticking it on. The shine is pretty good.

I was planning a 600 mile summer round trip with the In-Laws in town which filled up our MDX with no room for luggage. Did not want to spend $800 on a hard shell and do not have any room to store it afterwards. I found this cargo bag on Amazon and ordered it. It worked great. I was able to fit two airline type carry-ons and four duffel bags, see picture. The straps worked great to secure the load, I did put down a layer of camping foam on the bottom of the bag to protect the roof for good measure. It didn't rain during the trip so I can't speak to the water resistance.After the trip the cargo bag looks as good as new, my Father-In-Law wants one now. Not sure how many trips it will last but it paid for itself already and it's nicely folded and stored in its' original box in the garage.

Pretty much perfect. I bought a pair of these to mount on the front of my Chevy S-10 Blazer. I do a lot of driving at night on rural roads, so the stock high beams just didn't cut it. They pretty much do what they're suppose to, illuminate the road. The beam spread is perfect for a suitable "high beam replacement". These are not the off road long range version (those are the KC Daylighter 631's) so don't expect a light beam of 500 feet. However, they are super bright. I would say at least 4 times brighter than regular high beams. I would definitely recommend these for my application.

Very Nice dressing for car. I used it on my dashboard, door panel, and some plastic parts on the center console. It leaves a super nice shine, and dry to the touch about after 2 mins applied. I am quite satisfied with the product, and the scent is very nice. Previously, I use AeroSpace 303 and I find that Silk Shine is leaves more glossy and shiny finish.

I got these bulbs to replace the factory high beams because they did not match the 6000K HID headlights and LED fogs. These bulbs are 5000K but I was skeptical since they are halogen. I got them installed and they look great. The color is very close to matching my low beam headlights and the slight blue tint is nice too.

On my 2017 Ram 1500 Crew cab 2 wheel drive automatic tranny, no center console,  only small floor tray.  - The one piece back seat fit perfectly.  The driver side front fit perfectly.  The passenger side front seat DID NOT fit perfectly - it has a has about a half or 3/4 inch gap for about 9 inches long on the inside edge (see highlighted graphic).  It is installed correctly and I have waited for about a month at various temperatures for the gap to disappear where it meets the center hump. I have taken it out and put it back in several times to get it to line up..... I have pushed and pushed to make the gap disappear since first installing but it keeps returning - it's a defect in manufacturing process or quality control I think.  I may try a heat gun or something later in it's life.  (I hate complaining and giving so-so reviews and I hate returning things)  I absolutely hated the center hump piece fitment and had to return it.  I don't think I will be buying Husky liner accessories in the future.

Works as expected. At 5 1/2" it is pretty large. One of my cars, the jack point is slim so it just fit. The other car,  just fine. The other deal is make sure your jack can cradle it. If too small, the pad won't fit right. If bother items about are good it is very solid.

Was very leery of side steps for under $200.  I did extensive research on iBoard side steps for my 2017 Toyota Tacoma to find actual folks who installed these.  Simply put, if you like the look of these steps and you can follow simple instructions these are the steps for you.  Took me (one person) about 25 mins to install at a leisurely pace.  Very functional, wife was extremely happy !!  The company followed up with instructions and a note to make sure we were 100% happy.  This may of been my best Amazon experience to date, and we have had thousands.  Highly recommend !!On a side note - Not real sure why they are called iBoard?  May because like an iPhone they work well?  Or may because they are solid aluminum all around??

Great Deal.  In Case you don't know it, most Tacoma's are pre-wired for fog lights. (Check You-Tube). I used the fog lights and switch that was included.  I had to buy a separate relay since the one included with the wiring harness was not plug and play.  The fog lights went right in and were pretty much ready in about 25 mins.  The included switch did not plug into the already present Toyota harness.  I had to cut the wires and re-wire.  But it has been a week and they look great.  4.5 Stars.

The only thing I can complain about is the lack of range on the remotes and syncing multiple OPT7 remotes so that all are controlled by 1 remote .. I have 3 systems and use 3 remotes which is fine because i like using different colors in the 3 different locations. The quality of this system is top of the line.

These K700539 Stabilizer bar links had some interesting unexpected attributes.  The most significant was the white fittings are hallow and not solid like the original.  I kind of tossed a coin on this one vs K80631 with the blue bushing.  I ended up choosing these.  How they actually behave in use is hard to tell.  I would have to stick a video camera down there to see how they compress and behave.They don't torque.  The instructions say to tighten the bold flush... as I read them.  The installed easily with an actual nut head on each side.  One washer goes behind each white bushing with the top nut having the washer built in.  This apparently holds the shape and evenly distributes the pressure.Did I need to replace them?  The rubber on the old ones was quite hard after 13 years of heat with some cracking visible in some of them.  The old ones had also compressed at an angle into fixed shape which would indicate the rubber was no longer bouncing back... if being elastic was a feature the old ones should of had..I replaced so much of the front end suspension... which is riding incredibly well, I can only say these are contributing.  The first noticeable change in driving was on a road with surface damage... for the first time in as long as I can remember the suspension absorbed the pumps going up and down without making me feel like a bobble head in the cab.

I would have give 5 stars but one of the two links that arrived looked like it was a rebuilt and the other one came with the wrong hardware (fine thread instead of course thread) and was a difference length. Both boxes had the same part number so not sure what happened there. The threads on the short one were fine thread and rusted, the correct length and threaded part had the wrong hardware.  So with everything torn apart, I had no choice but to throw the NEW one in the trash and go to Autozone to buy a replacement MOOG part (since they carry them at a higher cost) since I didn't have time to go through replacing it through Amazon.

I picked these X-treme Vision 130 bulbs up last week to replace the depressingly dim stock halogen bulbs that came in our new 2017 GLE350 M. Benz. The vehicle uses a projector style headlamp, where the halogen bulb sits in a lensed tube that actively directs the light onto the road in front the car. The issue with halogen bulbs in projector style headlamps versus the older style reflector bowl style headlamps (that passively scatters the bulbs light everywhere) is that if you have dim yellow bulbs, then the projector doesnt have much to work with. Projector headlamps cut off and focuses the bulbs output downwards as to not blind oncoming traffic but you, as a driver,  cannot see anything beyond a short distance in front your vehicle if the bulb in them have poor road brightness.This is extremely dangerous for night time driving and it behooves me that Mercedes Benz wants customers to pay upwards of $80,000 to $90,000 for their GLE and GLS SUVs that come with cheap dim yellow halogen bulbs buried inside fancy projector style headlamps.My priority is road brightness and with the X-treme Vision 130 you get a noticeable increase road brightness that goes out well beyond 20 feet in front of the vehicle.The X-treme Vision bulbs color is NOT white, like other reviewers stated, but instead it is a 3700K white-yellow color. It is whiter than the stock halogen bulbs BUT it is certainly not LED or HID white.  The road brightness is much improved in distance of output  as well as width and intensity. See my pictures for the proof. In the one co-joined picture you will see a before (stock halogen) picture and after (X-treme Vision 130) picture with the before picture on the top. Other pictures show the light output and projector cut off on a wall 10 feet away. Even on the dash cam you can now see the light brightness on the road in front the vehicle.If you want the look of 4000K to 6500K and beyond but need to see at night then LEDs is a cheap and effective bet. Halogen bulbs in that color range, such as the Diamond Visions, will give you the look but will also sacrifice bulb life and road brightness.As for the X-treme Vision 130 I am extremely happy with my Amazon purchase. I do wish I could get the pure white look and keep the road brightness but LEDs and HID kits won't retrofit into my GLE350 tight headlamp housing. So I can only put in a halogen bulb.The X-treme Visions yellow is not that bad (it is a really light margarine-yellow color) and still looks good on my $70,000 Mercedes Benz SUV. See pictures I posted and also a video on my olaf2046 youtube channel.

My 1998 Pathfinder SE threw the following codes P1440 and P0325.  The P0325 is a knock sensor code and was triggered by the P1440.  The P1440 is an "Evap small leak" code.  Can be triggered by something as mundane as a loose gas cap or as was the case with mine, an issue with the Vapor canister.  I didn't think I had an issue with the gas cap, as there was clearly vacuum when opening it.  In then moving on and checking the lines to the Evap canister the problem became clear. At 19yrs old, my vapor canister had simply given up the ghost.  In removing the hose from the purge line on the canister to check for blockage, charcoal fell out of the line. There should not be charcoal there. The seal in the canister had failed.  Cleared the charcoal from the line, and replaced the Evap canister with this CP3090.  This is an exact duplicate of the original.  Everything lined up perfectly.  In doing this, you might want to hit the bolts with some WD40 or similar before attempting to remove the bolts, and torque them out slowly.  More than likely they are going to be quite rusty.  15 minute job.  Cleared codes and put back on the road.  Issue resolved.ps check prices.  I sourced this for $134 on EBAY including shipping.  Photos: 1 and 2. Showing CP3090 and the OEM side by side. 3. Showing original Evap Canister and charcoal spill from Purge line connector.

So far, so good!  Day one of  installation and I think they look great!  OK, so it isn't the real Audi logo but it works.  It is bright and eye catching!  I don't know if it will fade over time but it is starting out strong.The install was simple.  I used two small jeweler's flathead screwdriver to carefully pry out the old light.  The cable connecting the lamp is short so there isn't too much play once you fully free the lamp from the door.  It took me about 5 minutes on the first door because I was very careful and wanted to study how the cable fit into the lamp before disconnecting.  The new one easily clipped into the slot for my new A6 and after a few strong pushes, seated firmly into the opening.  The second light installed within 1 1/2 minutes as the process, once mastered, is simple to execute.I purchased two different logos for the rear doors to contrast the Audi rings I bought for the front.  The rears say "S Line" so I hope the look will tie nicely together.In all good packaging, good product and I recommend giving it a try!

The rotors are of very poor quality material. Maybe, it's a bad batch, but the fact still remains.The inner surfaces of the rotors were constantly getting 'lot rot' condition (thick layer of rust and glaze) except the car was driven daily. Lathing couldn't solve the problem either (although normally if the rotors are of standard / good quality - it should). The condition was coming again and again.It's worth mentioning that there was no such problems on original ACDelco rotors.And, needless to say, that the manufacturer refuses warranty claims and any responsibility for these lemons.

This hitch is exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted one that lower to the ground for my 1989 K3500.  Mine sits about 11 or 12 inches off the ground at the lowest point.  I will admit that my truck must be an oddball because the mounting didn't go exactly as planned.  It must be a 1-ton thing as there are several items on my truck that are not in accordance with my Chilton's manual (my front brakes not having hubless rotors, no knock sensor on the engine, etc).  I had an extra bar running inside of my frame rail that made mounting a little more difficult than intended.  Even with the delay, I had the hitch installed in less than 30-minutes thanks to the help of my trusty cutting wheel.  (Pictures included)  I had to mount the forward-most bolt upside down to make it fit since I didn't have nuts welded inside the frame (my truck never had factory tow hooks).As I said in the second sentence, this hitch is pretty low off the ground.  My truck seldom ever leaves the pavement so i am not at all worried about ground clearance.  I wanted a lower hitch because I am going to use a heavy-duty cargo basket that has a ramp and I wanted the most gentle angle possible for the ramp.  Furthermore, Curt makes a very heavy duty product and I extremely pleased with the construction and quality of this hitch.  I now need to order the lower air dam for my bumper since my truck didn't have one.  GM Part number 15569428 for models without tow hooks/fog lights and GM part number 15569430 if you do have tow hooks.  It looks kind of funny have a big gap between the bumper and the hitch.

Ended up using the shorter one on the front due to some spoke contact issues and the short ones were the perfect length. Rears rubbed slightly on the brake caliper on my 250L, only a bit and they were fine after a mile. Good buy.

Fit 2011 Forester very well, however the rear deflectors stick out much farther than the front deflectors which looks a little odd (when looking from the front of the car towards the back), but is not noticeable from the side. The rear deflectors have adhesive to help hold them on, but I'm still worried that they may fall out at some point. The fronts have to flex a lot to install them so I doubt they will ever fall out on their own. Took a total of 5 minutes to install all 4.

Contrary to the automated "does this fit my car" feature this is the correct dipstick for a 2005 Chrysler Town and Country. Less than 24 hours from order to delivery. Perfect match to the original.

Good price and really bright! I mounted to my motorcycle (only one currently) as a low beam with it pointed down. I have not gotten flashed by other cars yet and have been using it at night a few weeks. I mounted using some cheap brackets on here as well

They came packaged well with no damage or scratches that we could see. Fairly easy to install. They seem to be sturdy when used as a step.

Let's just start off by saying that yes, since the pads themselves are ceramic they need heat to be fully effective under any range of braking. With that being said do these things stop my 99 runner with ease now.Pedal effort has been reduced by 50% and the front end SQUATS under any braking load 50% or greater. I can actually lock up the front tires now which I've never been able to do before.Eventually I do want to upgrade my pads to carbotech 1521's because the pedal feel could be better with these. But I'm not complaining at all, I actually have serious confidence in my brakes for the first time since owning the vehicle. They dust pretty badly the first couple hundred miles but that's to be expected and I don't mind seeing as I detail my truck regularly. After 500 miles the dusting slows down significantly.I reused the stock hard lines going into the calipers for these which is a nightmare all by itself. That's honestly the hardest part of the swap and can be avoided if you upgrade the lines to steel braided or even rubber. The red on the calipers is a nice touch as well though I feel it will fade and chip quickly if you don't keep them cleaned often, because the paint job wasn't the best to begin with. Just be sure to follow the break in procedure to the T.You will need to trim the dust shield slightly. I had to trim alot of mine cause they were so rusted and contorted I ended up saying to hell with it and cutting a good bit of material off that was just so rusted it wasn't work leaving in place.I would definitely be weary of doing this upgrade if your wheels aren't at least 17 inches. Just a heads up.Happy wrenching!

Product arrived in good condition. This is a thick vinyl, which takes a bit of coaxing to conform. I left it in the sun to warm up for a while. I used this to wrap the roof of my car. It wasn't the easiest thing to work with, but working on a convex surface as I was, I don't know that anything would have been perfect. I trimmed it to approximate size, used some soapy water and went to work. It helps to stretch as much as you can when laying it down on  a three dimensional surface. I didn't do corners or scoops, but I am certain that a heat gun would be required to get the product to lay perfect. It took about four hours overall to do the roof, with more than an hour spent on the final corner of the roof. The end results are nice looking, and the vinyl has a nice texture and feel to it.

So far so good. Very easy install and I am very impressed with the brightness of the HID bulbs.  I used the Kenshun HID 55W Ballasts with these HID bulbs. I have HID 6000k for low beams and I also use the HID 6000k for my fog lights. You can honestly see the the difference in 6000k and 10000k bulbs. The Ballast really does make a difference in the brightness of the bulbs. I have seen reviews where ppl used a different ballast with theses bulbs and the out put wasn't so great. As today is the first day of installation, I am happy with what I see.

Works perfectly for me, I noticed that some people mentioned that they are throwing an engine code as soon as they start, I'm gonna have to say from experience that I have done that before too on a different vehicle because I either put the Mass Air FlowSensor in backwards or forgot to plug it backafter being installed.I've been looking at getting a k&n full air kit, but I didn't want to throw in a $300+ full intake system and have regrets because my car is a 3.5l CVT transmission.So I bought this to test the waters on my 2016 Nissan Pathfinder aka, "path-slider"  and I have to say that I really do like this. I will be saving up in the future to buy the full air intake system from k&n with the heat shield and smooth pipe to the throttle body.But thank you specture for giving me a budget friendly way to test the waters and also have it to test on my other vehicles.I would recommend getting this if you are interested in a more aggressive sounding engine and wanting to stand out from the crowd and feel like a true "fast and furious"Side note for you other car lovers, remember that it's important to have cool air and not too much "heat soak" you may get more power you may lose power but your car with sound like a total BAD ASS!!

Update: 12/1/2016Thule gave me a new cargo box (Force 626) because of the leak issue.  They shipped the new box to a local dealer, and I swapped the box there.  Impressed with the customer service.  The new box xeems to lock better--the previous one was always difficult to close on passenger side.  We will see about the leak.Update:  11/16/2016Had lots of rain yesterday and got water in the box--it came from the front lip--when I opened, the inner lip had some drops of water--guess they did not fix the problem of the front lid opening at speed--even with the added reinforcement to the front.  I was not driving fast on highway, so should not have lifted much, was driving local at 30-40 mph.  I will have to call them.  The box was securely closed.Had an accident with the box loaded, and the entire box shifted sideways.  The attachment claws are not strong enough to hold.>>>So far so good.  I couldn't decide on the XL or the XXL; I need it for relocating, so I followed the advice given in one of the comments here, always go for larger.  Since I don't have anyone to help me lift the box up on the car, I bought it from a retailer who would help install.  Another retailer wanted to charge $30 to install.  I took advantage of the 20% off sticker that all retailers offered for Memorial Day.However, this retailer in Fairfield County, CT at first tried to give me an obviously used one instead of a new one--there was something wrong with one of the latches, they said it was a common problem, no sweat, they will get a replacement part--and then I noticed the scratches, and the more I looked, the more scratches I found--I shone my high lumen flashlight upon it and it showed as being very obviously used.  I said I will not accept it, so they mysteriously found another one in stock--they had claimed they only had one XXL in stock.  Certainly tried to pull a fast one on me.They did a lopsided installation job.  I asked that they move it forward a bit to prevent touching the wagon's tailgate, and the installer said it would not go any further--he just did not want to bother.  And they just eye-balled the alignment.  Quality of service was certainly low.So I adjusted it myself--it was very easy--I loosened the cross bars and the cargo box, and moved the cross bars so the resulting front and back overhang were more or less the same--given the restriction of the sunroof and the stop in the factory rails.  I used a tape measure to make sure the cross bars and the box were exactly centered left and right--to 1/8 of an  inch precise--the front is narrower than the back by two inches.Adjustment was easy, but if you want to do it right, do it yourself.  Centering is important in terms of the airflow.  You want the airflow to hit the exact center of the box and disperse symmetrically.It is a big box, maybe should have gotten the XL, but it does not look bad--front is at the edge of the top of the windshield.  One thing to keep in mind is that although the difference in volume is 4 cubic feet (21 CF versus 17 CF), the amount of allowable weight of the XL and XXL is the same--110 lbs., to be distributed as 30-50-30 (50 lbs, in the middle of the box).If I had to do it over, I may go for the XL.  I have a long wagon, so it does not look that bad, but it would probably look better on a Chevy Surburban or a massive SUV, proportionally speaking--on my car, a Volvo wagon, it looks a bit like too much box.

I am pleased with this product.  I purchased 2 of these one being for my dad.  I ended up giving one to my buddy because we put them on our vehicles together.  All of them look good when installed but the real test regarding quality is how long they last before lights here and there begin to go out.  That will be determined in time but so far so good and I really like it.  I installed this product on my 2013 Dodge Ram Mega cab 3500 Laramie Edition.  I have included a picture of the bar lit as a running light and one shows how the light looks while in reverse.  The product has 2 sided tape on each one but I wouldn't depend on just that.  I used the fasteners as well as added a couple more to it.  That is my only negative thing to say about this product is they only send you 2 fasteners when you will really need 4 at minimum for a bar this long.I will update when and if the lights start to go out one by one.  At this time I would recommend this product because it does look good installed.

almost a year in and the seals on the shocks are starting to leak, they leaked right away and I figured I let them work them selves in but one is leaking again.Update way over a year shocks still leaking but no other issuse with the kit. Ill be replacing the shocks soon. I wanted to add alot of you are asking about the exhaust if you have an auto transmission you will need the spacers vut if you have a stick shift 6 speed like me 16 4 door then you will not need the spacers.

Quite a bit of work, but as the photo will show, it was worth it. My neighbor saw the results and ordered his kit for his old Lincoln. Made quite a difference on that car.

So far, so good.  Bought these to replace the older led bulbs I had used in multiple places in a 2015 Honda Fit hatchback. So far I have them installed in the license plate lights and the internal map lights and they are working great.  They put out a white light that is noticeably brighter than the ones they have replaced.  I'm happy woth this purchase so far!

The brushed finish is not uniform it is partially polished in some areas and more dull in others. When I received it, one of the studs that are screwed into the back used to mount it fell out and another one was loose. The studs themselves are about a quarter inch too long and I was unable to put a nut on the lower right stud. The door latch was too loose, and with the indentation intended for your finger it would be easy to pry the door open with a screwdriver. I had to tighten the nut on the back of the lock cylinder to make it more secure, and i bent the locking tab to make the door close tightly without putting too much tension on the key when locking. If the manufacturer reads this you need to eliminate the indentation in the frame for your finger, because you can open the door with the key in the lock, you don't need to use your finger. Additionally your quality control needs to be improved, make the finish uniform and ensure that the lock is secured tightly. Also make sure the latch holds the door closed tightly, my door had probably a quarter inch of play in it before I adjusted the latch plate to tighten it.

Save yourself some money.  If you have a Nissan Versa 2008-2010 range, this will solve that slight engine vibration.  Dealer wanted $240 to replace.  Amazon sells for $22:00+ and it takes about 10 minutes to change.  Had to use an extension bar on the ratchet to break loose the front mount bolt, but doable.  Look up YouTube video on 2009 Nissan Versa Engine Torque for how-to-do it.  Easy.  If the rubber in the front bolt section is cracked as my photos show, this is what you need.

Nice AC DELCO part save you from the stupid "E-vap"  a code that is nothing but a pain and an expense !  Be sure to check to see if you need the adapter plug, you'll probably need it  !!!!  ACDelco 19257603 ...(short wire with old plug new plug on it)  I used this on a 2009 Impala that had pile of codes for TANK purge vent. Part is located up under the filler neck behind the wheel, a little tight but simple job with only one rusty screw and a hose. I used a hose clamp on the hose just to be sure there wasn't any leakage where it slides in. (sorry, service light was bright and through off camera)

This was simple to install.  Pull away the dash border trim (insert key and turn to accesory, lower to 1st gear, and lower the steering wheel with emergency brake in play.)  With the bezel off, return gear to park and turn key off.  Use a small flat head screw driver on the left and right sides of currently installed selector to free it from the clips, and ease the selector forward.  Each wiring connector has a plastic key thats holds the connector in place.  Use flat head screw driver and slip it between the plastic lock clipping, and ease out the lower connector first.  Do not pull it out via holding the wires.  The upper connector was a bit more challenging.  I slipped the screw driver in where the lock clip holds it, and now it is free.  I used another small flat head screw driver and slipped it in between the casing on each side, adding small upward pressure at an angle to work the connecter out.  Next, attach lower cable connector to the new selector, then attach the other connector.  I didn't have as much length of cabling with the lower connector, that's why I removed it first, and reconnected it first.  With both connectors now in, ease the selector in its home, and it will snap in place.  Re insert key, turn to accesory, go back to 1st gear, and put the dash trim back on.  Move gear to the park position, put your steering back in your position of choice, and crank your truck.  I watched the dashboard where it lights up Driver 1, for any computer flags.  All is well.  And now, I have another part of my dash that has working back lighting.  I previously purchased the AC fan speed box that is under my radio.  I was only getting speeds 3 and 4 to work.  Now, with the new one, all speeds work, and the back lightning is fresh to see with how bright it is.  Btw, it took me longer to type all of this out on my cell phone than it did for me to install it.  One last note, last summer, my truck was saying "service 4WD."  When I cracked it, it was in 4WD, and I never selected it, nor have I ever toggled it (bought this truck used 2 years ago - '03 Avalanche."  I replaced the fuse to it immediately, and the warning went away.  It returned weeks later, and I was smart and already had another replacement fuse handy, and I installed it.  I have yet to see that warning come back on.  Considering the back lighting was not working on the selector, I thought maybe the unit itself could be bad, thus, another reason why I purchased this, and installed it.  I call it "a little peace of mind."

I've tried out several different LED bulbs for reverse lights and even some that say they put out more lumens but I feel that these are the best and that they are brighter than the others.These are very easy to install. You install them just like any other bulb. Since the polarity doesn't matter you don't need to worry about putting them in wrong.These LED lights will easily shame incandescent reverse lights and will put out way more light to make backing up easier and safer. If you have a reverse camera you should notice an improvement in the video at night.I really can't think of anything negative about these LEDs except that they cost more than standard replacement bulbs. They are well worth it though. I have several times more light output than before and I didn't really think that the Incandescent light output was that bad. I could not go back to incandescent bulbs now.As with replacing any bulbs with LEDs you will get the best results when matching the LED color to the lens in front of it. Brake lights should use red LEDs. These LEDs are perfect for reverse lights.The temperature / color is right at about 6000k. They are accurately advertised.If you have any problems with the LEDs flashing or glowing while you are not in reverse you will need to install a resistor to fix the problem. If you don't want to or don't have a resistor you can splice in a bulb socket and bulb on the back side. A small little 193 bulb should work. Either way will give the same result.I received these LED reverse lights for free to evaluate and review in an honest and unbiased manner.

Installed in the grill of my '07.5 Silverado. Looks awesome, but maybe include some mention of glue or loctite or similar to lock the threaded rods into the emblem themselves. I ended up using some window strip adhesive I had around because it's rubbery and won't vibrate loose.That said, beautifully made product. I like it a lot.

These guns work if take the time to clean and set them up properly. I strongly urge you to take all guns apart and clean, as someone thought it was a good idea to use some form of adhesive on most of the threaded areas. Clean these guns thoroughly and use a strong plumbers tape around all the male threaded ends, including the aluminum cups that holds the paint. I actually replaced my aluminum cups with plastic cups made by Kobalt. So lets talk about the end results. I used the 1.8 and 1.4 guns to repaint a set of 20 inch rims and I was quite impressed. The 1.8 tip sprayed primer fine however it left a significant amount of ORANGE PEEL which will require wet sanding afterwards. The 1.4 tip was exceptional minus a few issues getting the settings to work properly. Make sure you use a moisture filter on both the gun and the compressor.

This product may work great on steel brakes with dark colors like deep red or blue, but don't try it on aluminum calipers like Brembo with light colors like yellow or white.  The product did not want to stick to the aluminum despite extra cleaning and sanding, and it was very hard to get coverage.  When you try to brush on an additional coat 15-20 mins after like the instructions state, it would remove the previous coat.  I had to put it on so thick to get coverage, fortunately I had order 2 kits and used ever bit of paint from 2 kits to get good coverage.  I ended up using a mix of brushing and spraying, and the end result looks ok, but there is so much paint that it looks a little funky.  If you have high end calipers and want light colors, definitely go for some other product or send out to powder coat.

Not as bright as you would think from a modern 6w LED and runs excessively hot. Within 5 minutes of continuous burn time they reached between 280 and 330 degrees Fahrenheit. I picked one up after it had been on for a while and it burnt my fingerprint right off so I broke out the IR Thermo to get real temps. Becareful, these will burn skin.

Product(s) arrived in a single flat package (plastic, light light weight blister pack, similar to how pills/medicines are sometimes packaged) - each of the 100 items is separated from one another. There are 5 rows of 20, they are not packaged 100 in a bag. You can cut one out at a time...when 5 (or 20) are gone you could cut the package smaller. The blister pack is marginally less than 5 x 7 x 1/4". I can roll (short side) to about 1-1/4 dia x 4-3/4 long. You could roll it the other way, but it's impractical as the valves prevent good compression. As for fit/usage - put one so far into a bike tire valve stem and it worked perfectly at 55 psig.

First of all, these look awesome in my Shadow VLX compared to the stock ones that completely ruined the tail lines. They are tiny, I imagined them a bit larger but I actually like them better this way.They feel heavy and well built, seems like they are going to last. The only thing I don't completely like is that they are not very visible during the day being so small and not that bright compared to the stock large (and ugly) turn signals. I might add some led strip somewhere on the bike that is more visible instead in the future, but happy for now.

Very nice starter kit. Let's you know what you'll need more of. Clean flaky rust from metal whether needle scaler, grinder or wire wheel. Dilute degreaser into spray bottle, rinse with water allow to completely dry. Apply metal prep keep parts wet with solution for min 30 minutes brush bubbles away and allow to dry. Will leave zinc oxidized powder like coating don't panic this is correct. Apply Por15 paint do not get on skin it'll be with you for a week. Get the top coat and add for additional protection and life of the part. Once the paint is open its done so prep, prep, prep and paint everything you intend on painting lined up.

The bent  seam on the left and right side was cracking towards the middle. My bumper has a slight curve to it so there was constant preasure on the mount. I don't know if i tightened it to tight or if it was jyst a weak seam. Either way i had to remove it.

Bosch 50011225 QuietCast Premium Disc Brake for my 2010 Toyota Sienna fit great.  The disks came coated in a protective paint so no oil to remove as some disks have.  The disks matched the original perfectly.  They have cut tolerances clearly stamped on the outer edge so you know what your options are during your next brake service.  It has been a month now and there is no shaking or other indication of balance or vibration issues.  I installed these with a set of new Bosch pads.  My old disks came in handy too... I needed a new weighted base for a floor lamp.

I am amazed.  I have tried numerous cleaners in the past.  At issue, my 2010 Mazda CX-9.  Wheels have become tinted yellow/brown with age.  I have not been able to clean.  Last summer spent 1hr plus with small brush and cleaner spray with little result.  Figured I might have to have wheels refinished.Purchased Sonax after reading reviews.  Was skeptical, but hopeful. I applied, waited 5 min, power sprayed off.  Very nice result.  Re-applied.  After few minutes used soft brush 'Mothers Wheel & Wheel Well Long Handled Brush' purchased here - just like instructions read on bottle.  Results are FANTASTIC.  Very pleased.  See photos.  Took a before, just after applying, after 5 minutes, after spraying, and final after reapply and light brush.Very pleased

This fits snugly in the bottom/large compartment of the center console of my 2017 Ford Fusion Sport. The construction is solid, and the material feels rugged and like it could take a beating. If you're looking for a garbage can about 25% bigger than your average tin coffee can - this is a great choice. Check out the two attached images to get a sense of the scale, and how it can fit completely within larger consoles.

Arrived in a sturdy box, was a bit too tall for my 2005 Mustang battery tray, so had to buy a custom tray from UPR.I found out that you can take your old battery to (your local auto parts shop that has the same Irish last name as that host on FoxNews whose first name is Bill) for a $5 gift card!  Works great, but since I only drive the car once in awhile, I still keep it on a battery tender as a safety precaution.

The Good:Feels nice to the touchFits reasonably wellInstalls easily (if you remove the seat)The Bad:Elastic is a little fragile, be very careful when pulling on it, probably takes less than 10 pounds of force to break it off.This cover is Freakin BLUE! I was really hoping for "Dark Charcoal Grey" that I bought but I'm not all that picky and installed it anyway.Top is a little loose, its a bit puffy in a few places, tried moving the straps about a bit but it never really smoothed all the way out.Bottom line:This is a good temporary item to take the abuse and change out every few years.

The Good: Solid piece of metal. Great powdercoat. Spacers welded on bracket. Holes lined up perfectly.The Bad: Have to sand off powdercoat around mounting holes to ensure good ground, or your antenna won't work. Holes too big for standard firestik antenna stud. Easily fixed with a flat washer, but still. Once mounted, the bracket leaned toward the back glass of my hard top causing the antenna to hit wiper blade. Again, easy fix with a big crescent wrench and using the 3rd brake light as a reference, but I shouldn't have to modify a part that's supposed to be made for a specific application.Overall, I'm very happy with this bracket but, be prepared to do some "adjusting". Would buy again.

Meguiar's Hot Shine High Gloss Tire Spray is what I consider a good value spray. It is not the best out there but it is not one of those inexpensive sprays that do nothing much either. It is solid middle or slightly above middle quality out there and therefore a good value for those who are not trying to impress at a showroom and just wants a clean looking set of tires and want to protect their tires. This is sort of like a lotion for tires, especially useful in harsh climates.One tip is that when spraying you should consider doing so in a place where the run off stain will be OK with you or if want to keep the floors clean, place some rags on the bottom when spraying. Other than that, I would add that the shine does last a few days on normal driving in city traffic.

The manufacture has changed the design of the boot and bump stop. The part numbers have not changed nor has the box. You won't know which you're getting till you open the box. I've confirmed this with the manufacturer. I ordered both fronts and received one of each. I don't care which design I have, I just want a matched pair. I don't know yet how I'll resolve this.

Uncertain of quality as it did not fit. I used the following picture to determine the size of the bulb I needed. The T4.2 base diameter is 10mm and this matched the sized of the base of the bulb holder I was replacing. When I got it it would not fit. Reason is the bulb holder is 6.13 mm where as on my bulb holder it's 5mm. I removed the led/board and that part is actually 5mm and fits the hole in my gauge. So the plastic holder is 1.13 mm too thick to work. I have turned around and ordered T3 instead. The base on those are 8mm but the bulb holder part is 4.57mm and looks like it will work. Since the t3 only has 2 led I may remove the led form the t4.2 and put in in to the t3 base. Manufacturer should make sure the diameter of the base and the bulb holder both meet the proper diameter specs.

These look amazing on my Jeep and were a breeze to install; 4 simple screws (just make sure you use the longer screws on the correct sides of the guards).  I love the way they add customization to my jeep at a great price and I love that I was able to install without the help of my husband!

UNACCEPTABLE.  I could start with the shipping blunder, but that likely isn't allowed so I'll skip that and go right to this.  I just finished installing this lift in my garage.  Immediately, I notice one side of lift is spewing fluid.  Time to call customer care.  I make the call and they request that I give them the serial number.  I went outside to grab it, and what do I discover?  The lift is literally leaking from every single component.  Apparently 2 of three leaks are slow whereas the one was a quick leak.  Teflon tape on the threads were used, all bolts fittings were torqued down tightly.  This is absolutely 100% unacceptable.  Upon further inspection  (while looking for serial) I spotted "Made in China".  So disappointed.  It's on Dannmar to make this right now.  Will update with what happens as I went from a slight problem to a major one with the addition of time.  The only weight the lift has right now is the weight of the arms 2' off the floor.  Check out the pics.  Not happy!Customer service is now attempting to help me via troubleshooting.  I had to call them.  The arrogance on the phone is blatant.  Putting me on hold numerous times even cutting me off when I said I'm at the lift now....music.  Another 10 minutes goes by.  Total game playing.  This continues as the tech, not realizing I own my own shop and am extremely mechanically inclined starts playing more games.  The check valve and pressure release valve are 21mm and 22mm for a socket removal - I ask the tech what size socket is it...."umm, what?  There's no socket needed, just use a crescent wrench".  :/  I am getting more frustrated by the minute with this condescending behavior.  I admit, I lost my cool to this and used some expletives because when you step back - I'm troubleshooting a product with my time, with rude behavior, that cost over 2k, and being treated like - do you want help or not.  We go through some procedures, like adding teflon tape where the manual said not to, etc.  We make some progress on getting the leak at the motor to stop with the tape.  I explain some of the other issues I'm still having - like the lift not going up evenly and shuddering as well as coming back down - to me, the shuddering is obviously because of the transmission fluid cycling right back into the reservoir in reverse (where it should be holding).  More condescending comments come my way as I state it's shuddering ...."oh, did you put white lithium grease in the posts?"  No, I put it on the lift arms.  "Yeah, well is says that in the manual to do that".  Really?  Ok, I'll play along because they know as well as I do this is not because there wasn't white lithium grease, it's because the d#@# lift is defective.  That's the tone that is played constantly.  I explained I want my money back.  Answer is, well you will pay the shipping costs and a restock fee then.  This is what you folks are getting.  They are now going to reluctantly throw parts at me and waste my time figuring out what is wrong with their product (which is stated as designed in US, manufactured in China).  Part of this call was an effort to fix leaks at the posts and at the motor.  While we did nothing to the fittings at the quick disconnect, somehow Miguel thinks we've solved the issues.  I told him it takes time to see the leak.  His demeanor is, well it's not leaking now - must be fixed.  Just let me know if it's leaking later.  Again, I'm emphasizing this quality of service.  That was yesterday, today, of course!  New leaked transmission fluid.  I sent an email with pics.  I'm forced to waste time and play games.

Very bright light. I recently moved the license plate to the tailgate and had to find a new light solution. This led works very well and has a ton of light to light the plate. I was coming from using 2 light bolts as plate lights to this and this is much brighter. Easy wiring if you tap into the original plate light power wire and ground it somewhere that'll have a good ground.

This cover is certainly large enough for my 50cc scooter/moped but it is possibly too large. It is kinda large and baggy on my bike, but certainly functional as is.UPDATEI am returning this SC-6 and ordering an SC-5 (medium). If interested, check that item to see how it fit my 50cc scooter.UPDATE 2I got the SC-5 and it fits my 50cc scooter much better. Head over to the review of that item to see photos.

Quick shipping, ordered Friday, arrived Tuesday.  I installed these in the gauge cluster of my 2006 Jeep Wrangler.  I ordered this not really needing the sockets, just the bulbs.  I had planned on using just the bulbs but it turned out that one of my factory sockets was bad so having 6 extra sockets on hand saved the day. They are BRIGHT and they are BLUE!

If you're towing a trailer which is more than 50% of the tow vehicle weight, you need this.  For me it was the right tool for the job, towing a 7,000 lb tandem axle cargo trailer with my yukon xl k1500.  I foolishly towed it 300 miles with a standard hitch and it was a harrowing experience to say the least.  Had this hitch on the return trip and barely knew it was back there.  No squat, no sway, and the steering axle clearly felt more planted.  With a load distributing hitch my reciever is rated for 12,000 lbs.  This one is good for 8,000 which is just a little more than what my truck is rated for, so it's perfect.  I don't want the hitch to be the weak link in the towing equation, literally.For installation, I used a 1/2" ratchet with 14, 19 and 28mm sockets and a 10" crescent to hold the bolts.  You'll need a very big wrench to install a 2 5/16 ball with a 1.25" shank.  I finally had an excuse to break out my 15" crescent and giant Channellocks for that one.Being the thirty-something guy I am, I still haven't acquired the wisdom and patience that makes you stop and read the directions, lay everything out and think it through ftom beginning to end before starting.  I just ripped open the box and started bolting things together.  Much to my dismay I discovered the drawbar had a 1.25" hole and my 2 5/16 ball had a 1" shank.  Then came the most arduous part of the process, driving around town for an hour looking gor a 1.25" shank hitch ball.  Had I taken my time and inventoried the parts, I would have discovered beforehand that the kit provides a bushing which will allow you to use a 1" shank in the 1.25" hole.  Doh!!Installation was pretty straightforward.  The hitch is highly adjustable, both with angle and height.  I ended up installing mine with the hitch shank's vertical length down (as pictured), since my cargo trailer is low to the ground and the Yukon is not.  With an RV, which tend to have the frame a bit higher off the ground, you'll probably install it with the longer vertical length up, which is how the instructions show.  It didn't come with a sway control, but has provisions for one.  I didn't need one.Hooking up and disconnecting this hitch only takes a minute longer than a standard hitch.  But it is HEAVY!  If you're slight of stature you may have some difficulty lugging this around.I would have given 5 stars if it were made in USA.  I don't usually bolt Chinese parts to my vehicles, especially critical components, but there's  no American choice here that I know of.  The welds and powdercoat look decent enough.Some other products which have made my truck into a darn-good tow vehicle and I recommend you check out include:  Tekonsha P3 brake controllers and Air-Lift 1000 supplemental airbags for coil springs.

I installed the AMI 6047 on a 2015 Ram 1500 EcoDiesel.  I selected the Chrome Locking option, but the 6047 sizing is what matters for the fit (with various other options for locking v non, and color).  Given there is so much miss-information on Amazon and Ram 1500 ED forum about lack of aftermarket locking fuel doors, I made a youtube video of the installation.  See here:  [...]

May not be as loud as it says, but definitely better then a stock Kia/Hyundai horn! Kind of reminds me of a Greyhound bus... deep tone. Fit in the same area as the stock horn, although a lot larger. I used the stock wires without issue (no relay needed). See the comparisons (pictures)

The previous brand of rust preventer spray that I was using went on as a yellowish liquid with a strong odor.  I like this STA-BIL one much better because it goes on clear and it has very little odor, even less odor than WD-40.  Here is a picture of what it looks like with a heavy coat on the tools.  I like to keep a can of this on top of my tool chest.  I just spray right inside the tool drawer and then wipe it off with a paper towel.  These sprays make a big difference, they really reduce the amount of rust and my tools last much longer.

Wow, is this one solid hitch hook up! I will be only using it to slide my vice into for odd ball repairs. But most of all for a place to slide my big hitch assembly into for storage. I'll just wrap plastic around it for concealment and protection and that should do it. I'm quite a handyman always fiddling around fixing or making something, so a good solid vice base will be great. I used to slide the vice into my truck receiver, but this spot will be better for me.The picture shows my vice in my truck receiver, but imagine the same thing on my back trailer bumper with a solar light above it.

If your car has crazed paint, don't expect any product to make it look like new paint.I have used this product for 20 years and it is largely why my 16 year-old car and truck look as good as they do. This is THE PRODUCT for people who only want to apply wax once a year, though twice a year will give you awesome paint for as long as you use it.Also awesome on motorcycle plastic, like dirt bike fenders. I also find it cleans and protects tail lights and plastic headlight covers well. best cleaning wax product I have ever used.

Good quality, great price and super easy to install.  I put the T-15 torque bit into a 1/4 inch mini ratchet to remove existing screws and did not have to remove the tires (front or back).  Easy to follow directions.  Installed all 4 in less than 1 hour.  Made to fit over the existing plastic molding at base of wheel well.  Look great on my 2014 Z71 Silverado.

Super easy to use, really easy to read instructions, only thing I would be cautious of is don't let the gun fall over with a bottle attached to it and don't crank the bottle on there super tight... I messed that one up. Also I called Upol about how to clean the gun because I don't have gun cleaner, they recommended lacquer thinner, I put some in a jar and sprayed it through the gun, cleaned everything right up!

Well, when I bought the motor for the driver's door of my Bronco I also got this one for my passenger's door or tailgate, whichever failed first. It ended up being the Tailgate. Installing it was a pain because the tailgate can be hard to work on if you don't remove the glass (I wasn't home and had nowhere to place the glass), and I actually had to cut part of the nylon webbing on the head of the motor in order to make it fit, which I might or not have avoided if I flipped it. Only 2 out of the 3 bolts lined up, the 3rd one would require some drilling, but it's doable. I added some pictures of the cuts as a guide for any other Bronco owners, so far it's been 7 months and I haven't had any problems with this. I also had to splice and join the connector for a cleaner install. After all was said and done I once again have a working tailgate glass, but this motor is a little smaller and less powerful than the OEM part, just don't fool too much with it and it will last, of course, since you already got in there, take the time to lube all the moving parts of the mechanism, and the rubber in the weather stripping. These little motors are durable, the one in my driver side door (see my review here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2V2SM3LBGXKLS/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000C11JSE ) already has almost 5 years in there and works great.As already stated, this one will work on some Fords or in my case, in my Bronco's passenger door or tailgate (with some mods), the one for your driver side window is this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dorman-742-250-Window-Lift-Motor/dp/B000C11JSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dorman 742-250 Window Lift Motor</a>

This stuff is definitely something you'd want to have on hand when completing a brake job. The lubricant is a deep Forrest green color and flows out effortlessly. It has some weight to it so it would seem that it would definitely withstand heat and rain. The small size it all you'd need to do a compact or small sedan in my opinion but like I said this something you'd definitely want to have on hand so getting a bigger size is a way to go if you can afford the few extra bucks. Haven't heard a peep since I used this product either.

I wanted a tire gel that I could also dilute to dress exterior black plastic trim, and this did the trick. I don't like an overly greasy product, and I wanted it to be dry to the touch. Just the right amount of gloss on my tires. Not overly shiny, so if you are looking for that "wet" shiny black tire look, try a different product, but personally I can't stand the overly greasy looking tire. This product fills that need perfectly. A little goes a long way. Highly recommended.

I used these for a 12 volt DIY solar generator I am building. I chose to add a momentary on/off switch on the voltmeter so it's not illuminated all the time. This package has all you need to wire up these 12 volt accessories(wiring, fuses, connectors). I would recommend using these for any 12 volt project you have, they are high quality and look great! I am planning on using a 30amp solar charge controller and a 35 AH 12volt battery.

50" curved light bar installed on 2015 Ram 2500 using SoCal Super Trucks light bracket. This thing is great quality for the money. It really does turn night into day, pictures don't do it justice, you have to see it to really appreciate just how bright it really is. Great field of view, lights up both wide view and far away at the same time. I think I can see into tomorrow. Just installed a couple of days ago, I will followup if there are any problems in the future.

I got this for my 2015 Kawasaki Vulcan S without knowing if it would even fit. It turned out that it fit perfectly, and I was even able to use the fork attachment hardware, in addition to the handlebar attachments, for a really solid fit. It looks really good and gives better coverage than the Kawasaki shield, at a much lower price.

Perfect for my project. Testd all the markers and they work. They have a 2 wire lead that is about 7 1/2 inches long. The marker is just under 4 inches in length, 3/4 width, and just under 7/8 in thickness without the included self adhesive gasket. The vendor supplied a package of nuts, washers, and bolts. I required a marker of a low profile to fit flushly on the side of my 1990 30 foot Coachman Travel Master motorhome which uses corrugated fiberglass siding for structural side wall strength. These LED lights fit flush in the valley area of the siding. These look perfect.for the project.  Now I will wire these up to be side markers with the parking lights and will float the ground with the turn circuit so marker can signal my intention to change lane or turn. Also since they are diode lights, auto relays have to be used if the ground is to be floated between the turn and marker positive voltage circuit. Wire the left and right side each on a separate relay. When the marker lights are on and a turn signal is turn on the markers will flash in out of phase with the vehicle's front and rear signal lights. If the parking light circuit is off then these LED side marker will flash with the other turn signals. In bright day light the markers are not that visible. At night the are very good. Not overly bright to be distracting.

Dont buy this product if youll be driving you car in any kind of wet weather. For starters, the keychain remote NEVER worked from day one. They sent me a replacement, it worked for a week or so, but you had to be within at most 10ft of the control box for the keychain to work the lights. Than, with the expansion kit I bought for my grill, one of the splitters didn't work. Ended up having a replacement sent out to me, worked well for a month or so, now Im having trouble with the splitter again. Now,(yes, theres more) the main light under the driver side just suddenly went out. After not driving the car for almost a week. Not sure how that happens. Personally, I feel as if the connectors aren't water proof. Even if you do tape them up. Not truly plug & play. Take your money elsewhere. I wouldnt be so upset if I cheaped out and got a cheap underglow kit. But this was supposed to be top of the line, turns out, its not. Save your money.

These lights are AWESOME and super easy to install.  They are much brighter then the stock JK light and the quality is so much better.  Total install time was about 30 minutes from start to finish.  Fit was perfect I saw no gaps as stated in other reviews.  Priced higher then some other light that I considered but after receiving these light it was obvious that they are built to last a very long time.

No complaints about the fitment, they're standard tire caps in that regard. However, after a few months they've all started to turn green.

My original 2007 Pathfinder key fob looks pretty beat up so this new one sure looks great.  I notice that the buttons seem a millimeter or three a little more recessed than the original one.  Once programmed, there seems to be a few millisecond delay once I use the new remote to arm or disarm my vehicle, or maybe it seems like I have to press the buttons just a tad longer or harder (I can't decide which one right now).  In any case, it doesn't really detract from the function, and for the price, seems totally worth the minuscule extra effort, but might require a star deduction.Minus another star for not including the "Free DIY Programming Instructions" as stated in the product description.  Luckily, I have my vehicle's service manual and the programming steps were quite painless and took less than a minute to do.  Instead of including the instructions, there was a slip of paper included with the remote that said, "Thank you for your purchase.  If this order requires programming instructions or if we can be of any further service, please email us at CSFORKEYS@GMAIL.COM with your vehicles year, model, and make and your contact information.  Thank you."  This isn't close to being a deal breaker, but it is really annoying to have to go dig out the service manual and sift through a few hundred pages.Great price, Prime delivery, adequate product.  I would probably order it again.

These are really good brake pads. They are packaged kind fancy, arranged with care in foam padding. They installed well and seem to be quiet with no squeaking. Although they did come with a small packet of silicone caliper grease, this set did not come with the clips as stated and pictured.

This is the second purchase of a Custom Dynamics Knight Riderz Light Bar... It has worked so well on my first bike, when I bought a larger bike, I had to add one to it as well!  The sequential light is VERY noticeable even in daylight, but really pops at night! Same thing for the strobe effect when you apply the brakes... ATTENTION GRABBING! Very pleased with these light bars!The unit is the perfect size for most bikes, and can be adapted to work just about anywhere you have a flat surface - 4.75" wide and only 0.75" tall, but mounting must be flush against the something (3M tape is on the back of the unit, not top or bottom).My Honda Sabre's stock brake-light is not very bright (even with an LED lamp installed), so adding this light kit really supplements my running and brake-light needs.  I did not have a good surface choice for mounting this light, and I didn't want it on the sissy bar because my tail-bag would cover it when traveling.  I purchased a chrome license plate cover which was wider on one side, which provided the perfect mounting point for this light!  Find the center on the frame, drill a 1/4" hole, thread the wires through the hole, and press the light bar onto the smooth chrome... Yes, it is that simple to add!  I use Automotive RTV sealant to fill the hole and keep the wiring from moving around at the frame hole, and it also improves water resistance where the wires enter the light-bar from the back.  Wiring the light is easy if you have a little, basic knowledge of 12V-DC electrical systems... Black to ground, Red to Brake-light wire, Blue to Running-light wire.One thing I can say about how well these work is that people don't ride up on my back tire anymore at stop lights! I use to have cars stopping within inches of my rear tire, but since this light bar has been installed, I don't think anyone has come closer to me than at least a full car-length... It really gets the attention of the driver behind you.Now, if you don't want the sequential light to function (or it is not legal in your state to have a sequential light in running-mode), you don't have to hook up that wire (the blue one)... its that simple...  Another option is to acquire a photo-resistor (pull one from a broken solar pathway marker light or buy one from electrical supply house), and place the photo-resistor inline with the blue wire.  The resistor will close the circuit when it is dark enough.  Now the sequential light only functions from twilight to early dawn, or on a really cloudy day / bad weather... when it is needed most, for extra visibility.

I purchased the DU-HA underseat storage for my 16 Sierra 1500 from a local H&H truck shop. After looking at both the Husky and this one I decided to go with this one. I like the exterior look of the husky while the seats are down but the DU-HA seems to have more space to store and goes closer to the edge of the seat. Plus with a strap on each side it keeps everything in place. The Husky liner only uses one strap in the center.I have the All Terrain X which has the full floor length liners and even though there is a small hump/raised section in them the DU-HA still fits and is flush with the bottom of the seats. I like the dividers on this one over the other brands as well

Excellent product. Almost made a huge install mistake though. I was leery of the fish wire slipping off the threads so i wrapped a couple rounds of masking tape over it. Almost lost the bolt because the tolerances are VERY close. Had to yell for my 12yr old to give me a set of needlenose vice grips and brute force pull it through! Engineered awesome and quality materials. Will be purchasing Tygers push bar next!

This was the only pulley I had an issue with when replacing all my pulleys and belts.  The issue is really ACdelco's fault.  If you put in your VIN they MAY give you this part as the replacement part... and the reason... they don't make one identical to my original part, but this one will fit.I decided to use my original which has three bolt points.  One of these days I will replace it with one made by a competitor that is a perfect match to my original.  My concern is it could snap the ears off the water pump where the thing bolts on.  I did not want to find out.So glance in your engine and see what you have.  If it is two bolt points with no triangular mounting bracket this is the one.I will include a photo of my water pump.  The two bolts on the ears to the left are where this would connect.  The third bolt on mine went firmly into the solid body above the water pump mount.

If you know how to use it, it never fail you. Already had a few cars above 2012 and BMW.Tip:1. don't start the Car2. Plug it into the Car obd3. Plug the other end to the jack, turn the jack on4. Remember don't ever start the Car while plug in.5. Change the battery and while plug in, then completed.6. Remove the memory saver. Then start the car while the battery already install.

Pros- quality build- snug tolerances, just barely slid over my one ton axle hub (perfect)- 2" was just barely enough to cover my stock lugs, no cutting requiredCons- You'll need a thin walled 19mm deep socket to get these on. I guess more meat on the spacer is good but I wouldn't have minded a slightly larger diameter hole to get my socket into.Some folks asked for pictures of these in between dually wheels, see attached. I put them on a 2004 Silverado 3500 between the duals and they provided perfect spacing for larger tires.

Received the wiper switch a couple of days ago and proceeded to install right away. The switch is a quality OEM item with no issues. My 2013 Tacoma 2.7 4x4 automatic did not come with the intermittent wiper switch, very annoying to say the least, specially when you live in a rainy place like Seattle.The install was very straight forward, thanks to a number of you tube videos. The new lever fit and connected perfectly where the original lever was with no modifications of any sort.  The new switch lever works perfectly and I am very glad to have this feature on my base Tacoma.Would strongly recommend getting this item as an upgrade if your vehicle does not have the intermittent wiper feature.

I was using the Mobil 1 AFE for our 2014 Honda Civic then I decided to give this Valvoline a try, and you know what? For the price, Ill stick to this, I go to Walmart because its usually on Sale there, its 24 dollars as compared to the $22 Mobil 1 is, BUT, after putting it in, the car runs smoother, gas mileage is about the same, but Ive noticed more response in our throttle, even with the CVT. So, after reading forums and UOAs Valvoline synpower is an outstanding synthetic! And it has a better detergent for withstanding hotter climates, so, F*** yeah Valvoline!!!!!Update::: I just switched again from Mobil 1 to Synpower (now marketed as Advanced Full synthetic) on my Mazda 3 Skyactiv, for two reasons. #1 I was really impressed with the way it behaved in my Honda. #2 Ive had nothing but bad luck with Mobil 1 in my cars, so its not a factual thing, but more personal. Mobil1 always found its way OUT of my car. Now, that being said, Valvoline is not marketed as an extended life Synthetic, rather much like wix, they say to stick with the manufacturers oil change interval. Now, down to the actual behavior, my Mazda, Ive noticed a huge increase in throttle response, fuel economy, and my engine is quieter and smoother so far. And as far as marketing, Ive heard guys say that, Valvoline, regardless will outperform a lot of on the shelf competitors, and Im seeing huge benefits. Ill stick with the Valvoline.

Results we're better than expected.  I replace two incandescent bulbs on my motorcycle tail light with these LED bulbs.  They are WAY brighter. The brake light also respond quicker vs incandescent which is important to when riding a motorcycle.  Now I can hook up a LED strobe module to get more noticed. I'd highly recommend these.

Misleading at best as this filter has 1/2 the thickness of filtration area as the OEM. Fram, if you are going to offer a "budget" air filter you should clearly advertise it that way so people know what they are ordering is NOT the same as there OEM part. Very disappointed to say the least. The air cleaner is your engines first line of defense against dirt and contaminants that are harmful to the engine; this is a critical.

Originally bought it due to the deep BLACK powder coated look. NOT the case!! It's more of a cheap dark grey paint. The hook itself is a cool design. The paint is not. Reason for the 1 star was due to not selling as pictured! Also made in China! Pretty expensive for what you are actually receiving.Even the pin holding the latch is different. The selling one in the picture shows a black hex bolt. I was sent a cheap pin. This needs to be addressed asap!

great price for solving hyperflash problems with led bulbs. i installed these with 1157 front signal switchbacks.unlike others, my tap connectors worked well. the outer line was a little snug (the one closest to the locking clasp to run your bulb wire - not your resistor wire) but using a 3/16 or 1/4 flathead while pushing in your bulb wire made it fit perfectly.just make sure you mount your heatsink on metal - away from other wires and plastics. after about 10 minutes of turn signal action, the resistors were at 222+ degrees fahrenheit and climbing! so if you end up installing these resistors and need to use your 4-ways/emergency signals for a long time - you might want to keep that in mind. see image.running the front "parking light" or "corner light" function didn't increase the temperature since the resistors were wired only to the circuits for when the turning signals were on.

Large was perfect fit for Honda cb300f. I wouldn't go any smaller since the large was rated for 600-1000cc sports bike. Only complaint is I wish it had more vents. The only vents are one on each side is a 1 inch piece of mesh with a flap. Other than that it doesn't appear to be heavy duty stitching or material so I would be gentle putting on and taking off of your bike. For the price and perfect fit for my bike, it was 1/4 the cost of what the Honda dealership was charging for a cover.

This is one of the best waxes I have ever used. It goes on nicely, and comes off with far less effort than some other paste waxes I have used. I use this on my daily driver as well as my 1975 Plymouth Duster, and will buy it again when I run out. This wax has good durability/longevity on my daily driver. As with most paste waxes, use caution to avoid getting it on vinyl or rubber areas as it will leave white residue behind, but on paint, this product is excellent.

All of our furniture is leather and some of the pieces are starting to show their age.  I received this bottle of deep cleaner for my use.I tried it on a couch cushion that had some staining from jeans and it also has deep creases in it from age and use.The cleaner comes in a large bottle with no pump attachment.  Instead of wasting this on a cloth, I put some in my hand and rubbed it in, making sure to get into all the grooves and creases.  If you rub it in vigorously, you will see it start to turn a whitish color, like any cleaner, it got a bit opaque.  I left it on the cushion for a minute, then took a clean cloth and buffed it out.  There was very little product left to buff, as the leather absorbed it.The product smells very nice: citrusy and fresh. The thickness is perfect, not runny at all (remember to shake the bottle first).My hands (as I applied this with my hands, not cloth) felt nice and smooth after as well.The difference between before and after is very noticeable. It took off the light blue (denim) staining as well.The color is nice and rich and the whitish creases took on a nice tone.Refreshed some tired furniture, but we can't part with it because it is so comfortable.

Almost perfect but if the steering wheel is not thick it will be loose and move around it. To remedy this issue I got a cheap black rubber bungee cord and cut a piece the same size as he piece provided. This will close the gap and keep it from spinning around and being loose.See pics I providedOther than that it's perfect.  I installed mine inward.

What I didn't like was changing my spark plugs in the first place, but these were a great OEM fit for my 2006 Ford F-150 5.4L V8 Triton.  I did not have to gap these plugs (they are pre-gapped).  I used anti-seize on the threads so I don't repeat the pain of replacing these (see photo) .  I ordered 8 spark plugs and they sent me two boxes which included 4 individually boxed plugs each.  They were also far cheaper on amazon (by about 50%) than my local chain auto parts stores.  I trust the Motorcraft name and these did not disappoint.

This bag is fantastic!! This will be my second long ride with this bag.. I am taking a week long trip to Sturgis leaving from Houston, I was able to pack enough clothes in the center compartment including a hoodie and toiletries for a 10 day trip. The side pocket are large enough to hold my leather jacket, gloves and beanie on one side and my Raingear and a few other thing on the other. I used a 15" x 15" cargo net to strap my helmet down to the top using the metal d-rings. There are other little zipper pockets for a book, koozy, USB Cables and so on.. I also have saddles bags on the Bike that have nothing in them at this point, so plenty of room to bring back souvenirs from Sturgis and all 7 states.I drove through a good down pour on the last trip, although the zippers are weather resistant vs. proof i didn't have any water in the bag. BUT even with this being said as a precaution I created a bag cover that also straps to the d-rings for a little added protection.

I bought these a few months ago and now that the warmer weather has arrived I was able to put them on. I needed help with lining up the bumper against the frame to mark where the holes were going to go but other than that the steps were relatively simple to install. A lot of people mentioned that the hardware that comes with are junk but I did not have a problem with them.  I did drill 1/8 holes first and then enlarged those holes to 5/16 size before using the hardware.  It is a little more time consuming this way but I didn't strip any bolts then have to make an extra trip to the hardware store so thats a win in my book. They look great and they are sturdy. I got mine for about $190 so they are definitely worth it. In my picture you will see my rusty old steps and then these new ones

If your Gen 3 Toyota 4Runner is getting the dreaded CHECK ENGINE light then you need a new gas cap.  Why is that?  Nobody knows.  Look at my picture: 1 is bad & old and the other is this item.  This fuel cap appears to be OEM factory Toyota.  This is my 3rd gas cap in 13 years and a new gas cap solved the Check Engine light every time!  I'm driving a 2005 Toyota 4Runner Sport with a V8 engine.  My maintenance records indicate I've swapped out the gas cap at 35K, 74K and now at 177,500 miles.  This time, though, I was getting the CHECK ENGINE and the VSC TRAC lights illuminated on my dash.  BUY THIS GAS CAP & FIX THAT CHECK ENGINE LIGHT!

Good quality kit, instructions need some revision for 2014+ trucks (read lower for my install tips). Luckily I was able to call to call tech support for installation assistance, although their suggestion of rotating the strut body 180 degrees just didn't sit right with me.When the spacer is put on top of the strut, it reindexes 180 degrees. This makes the bar pin sit at the wrong angle to fit into the lower control arm and impossible to install. Tech support suggested putting the top strut mount in, then rotating the strut body 180 degrees. This makes the coil sit at an awkward angle and would rub on the strut body. What I did was put the lower mount into the lower control arm then push the strut into the right orientation. It takes a little patience to get it to work, but altogether is better than having the coil sitting at an awkward angle.Overall I would use this kit again.

This is just the shell, in other words you use your own electronics.  It does include the silicone rubber insert, the buttons, and the plastic frame that holds the battery.  You actually do not need to use the battery frame though, unless yours in broken for some reason.  The plastic is the same thickness as OEM, and the buttons and designs are identical.  The actual fit was perfect.  I installed my good electronic module and once snapped together, this worked perfectly, no loose buttons, no slop, worked great.  The main difference between this and OEM (from a 2007 Odyssey in my case): OEM has a curved back and slightly curved sides.  This one is flat and square, no curves.  Also this one has an extra cutout for a badge on the back that the OEM one does not have.  As for the Honda badge, you can easily remove your old one and stick it on this one.

to have the led light up when button is pushed black is ground, tie red and blue wire together that will connect to what ever you wanted to be turned on. green is 12v Power and the yellow one is not needed. Hook them up and click it your product it will light up with what ever you have it wired to hope this helps.once you figure it out it looks great the only thing is wish it came with the diagram but it wasn't hard to figure out other than that its a great product.

Surprisingly, these lights were Factory quality, fit perfectly and look excellent. I would say they're a great product for the money, but they're just a great product.Thankfully, the mounting holes matched my original lights on my 95 motorhome.

After 3 weeks, three of the LEDs went out, really disappointing. It's a great light bar, easy to install, bright, and looks good, but none of the LEDs should have went out in three weeks... Hopefully I won't have as much trouble with their support as others have.Will update my review with how support goes.UPDATE: Checked on my previous lights and those 3 lights that went out, came back a week ago. Another week later, they're out again. Not sure what's happening with them but oh well, replacement came in and will be swapping the two out soon. Didn't have any trouble with getting my replacement light bar either, it was actually really easy and they shipped a replacement immediately. But I didn't have to go through Rampage, I went through the replacement process with Amazon.UPDATE 2: 8/4/2014Replacement has been working perfect for the past 7-8 months! No burnt out LEDs or any problems this time around. Great product and support!

I purchased this light and waited to install for about a month. I was very happy with how bright it was. Then things went south in a hurry. I live in Oregon, and yes it rains, snows, and everything else. After installing, I went on hunting trip. We had a lot of rain the on our trip over. I noticed a little condensation. No worries. I thought it could be from the changes in altitude and getting colder. Next day, looked and water behind the lens. Water froze. Finally got home and contacted seller. Sent pics to seller. E-mail from seller "only warrantied for 1 month from date of purchase. What electronic manufacturer is only 1 month. E-mailed Amazon and sent credited my account the purchase price. All I wanted was a replacement. Looks like I will take a load of screws out and have to seal it the way it should have been to begin with. Thank you Amazon for quickly returning hard earned money. Here are some pics. As you can tell there is about 1/4" of water in it.

These are great! I've seen comments about rattling, I really didn't notice it, but as soon as I received them, I modified them. Took 30 minutes for all six of them, but no rattle.

I used VHT Paint (Primer, Satin Black, and Clear) to restore my motorcycle wheels which had over 100,000 miles on them and looked pretty beat up.I really like working with VHT spray paint and is my first choice for a number of different applications from brake parts to engine blocks.  So when I was looking for paint to restore my wheels, I turned to VHT.This paint spray nicely - and dries to the touch in 30 minutes.  They suggest two light coats followed by one medium coat allowing 10 minutes in between coats.  All coats should be applied within 1 hour.  Any additional coats after the one hour - you need to wait 7 days for the paint to cure.This is about the only spray paint I have found that you can actually use rubbing compound to polish out the final coat and achieve a really smooth, glossy surface.  My wheels look like brand new4-3-2015  The center plastic caps on my 14 year old Nissan were starting to look shabby, so of course I turned to my favorite paint.  The Chevy Silver is not a perfect match for my NIssan, but close enough

We purchased two of these lights and the lighting harness with a switch on it. It was so easy to install them on our pontoon boat.  Now we can take evening cruises and get the boat back on the trailer with ease. The lights shine brightly and illuminate the path ahead of us. Great quality and fast shipping.  definitely would recommend. We are getting some for our UTV.

This issue has been resolved and they have sent me a new pair of shackles! Great customer service.Old review:"Had to change my review after having these shackles installed for a few short weeks.  They have now began to rust inside the shackle pin hole, it looks like they were never painted on the inside.  I wouldn't mind this if they didn't leave a nasty rust streak down my bumper."

Bought this as one of the matched pair of Freeway Blasters about six years ago. They were both pretty anemic sounding under the hood of my GMC 3/4, so I added a relay at the underhood fuse box and used it to feed power via a heavier gauge wire from a bolt terminal. They immediately got very loud and haven't quit yet! They've been submerged only once so I don't know if they were spared by an air block or not. A lesson learned in showing that a very loud horn pair may need a better-than-OEM installation if they can't get the current they need.

If you compare it whit the stock bulb, yes it is brighter and a little whiter. But after installing both bulbs and look at it at night, it's just bright not white. I don't get all the 5 ratings. It's OK but it's not that bright and white compare to other bulbs out there. I actually find it pricy for what it can deliver. I just hope it last for a long time.

UPDATE - January 2018As noted in my December 2017 update, I had concerns about this unit leaking oil into areas where it shouldn't be and eventually into the throttle body and air intake. Sure enough, my concerns were shown to be true. I had ordered an Nissan OEM cover around Christmas but wasn't able to install due to some travel and poor weather. I ended up working on my car on January 10, 2018. I first checked compression to make sure the issue wasn't greater than I had thought. The compression was consistent across cylinders, so I started the process of removing the valve cover. Upon removal, I could see oil in the tube connecting the PCV to the intake manifold and the tube connected to the air intake.I inspected the Dorman valve cover as noted in several YouTube videos and compared it to the Nissan version. You can clearly see the baffle plate (for lack of a better term) isn't adhered in areas where it should be, which allowed the oil to enter air passages. I've attached images of the non-adhered areas that were lifting and also of my intake manifold looking directly into it. After installation of the OEM valve cover, I carefully cleaned the throttle body using a cleaner made for it and then used Seafoam to clean the intake manifold.My car is running slightly better in that there is no longer detonation, but performance is still sluggish. The exhaust note is muted and there is little to no acceleration at highway speeds. If I do get on it, it appears the back pressure is so great that exhaust leaks from the flange near the pre-catalytic converter and flex pipe connection. A rotten egg smell follows, which is usually a sign of a failing cat. I don't know if exhaust from a pre-cat would smell like that without any downstream blockage.My concerns about blockage are related to the damage that burning oil causes to a catalytic converter. I'd been burning oil for about 1.5 years, so that's a lot of contamination deposited into a cat. Converters aren't designed to scrub oil, and the excess oil can cause overheating and eventually melting or a collapse of the honeycomb inside the cat. I just purchased an infrared thermometer to check catalytic converter temps at the input and outlet. That should at least let me know if in fact the catalytic converter is clogged. I can then inspect upon removal.Changing the valve cover was a necessity, and even though this design flaw was supposedly modified in late 2016, I would spend the few extra bucks and get the OEM version. Units with this flaw weren't recalled seeing as there wasn't a 'safety' issue. However, when engine performance is lacking due to burning a non-ideal air/fuel mixture, I think there is a safety issue. Dorman usually has decent products, but this one is plain awful.UPDATE : December 2017This generation of Nissan Altimas (2002-2006) are known for some issues. I tried to prevent them by replacing the pre-catalytic converter and replacing the valve cover among other things. I replaced the valve cover because of a leak around the gasket not because oil was leaking into the spark plug wells. As I noted in my original review, installation went well and I expected no problems with this unit.Fast forward to late 2017 and I'm experiencing some engine performance issues. I have a noticeable lack of acceleration particularly at highway speeds, detonation or pinging in the engine if I press the pedal to gain more acceleration, loss of 2-3 mpg and finally oil loss. I usually change my oil at about 5K miles, and within that time, I lose 1.5 to 2 quarts. There are no noticeable drips around the engine or oil pan. This led me to believe it was being consumed internally.The symptoms I'm experiencing can be due to numerous issues either with mechanical or sensor issues. I don't have any codes right now, so I was thinking about knock sensor issues, MAF sensor issues or head gasket failure. In the course of my investigation I encountered an article stating that oil consumption through the throttle body could cause all the issues I'm experiencing.That information led me to a couple of negative articles and videos about Dorman valve covers for Nissan Altimas. The general idea is that they're improperly sealed, and this allows oil into areas where it shouldn't be and subsequently sucked into the PCV valve and throttle body. This was the easiest item for me to check as it involved only taking off the air cleaner, MAF sensor and air intake tube to gain access into the throttle body.Sure enough, there was oil in the throttle body beyond the butterfly valve and into the air intake tube. In extreme cases oil could make its way into the airbox, but I was fortunate not to experience that. Engine oil should never be in the throttle body or air intake tube. The only reason for its presence has to be the situation I described above.The bottom line is that I am going to reduce my 5-star rating of this product to 1-star. I suppose there are some Dorman valve covers that are acceptable. If you choose to buy one, I would check if all corners and edges are bonded properly. I'm choosing not to buy another one of these as a replacement. I'm going with the Nissan OEM version even though I have to buy another gasket. I look at this is a total waste of money, time and effort and will try to pursue something from Dorman.There is a video on YouTube of a gentleman explaining the issue, and he indicated he contacted Dorman and the cover was redesigned in October 2015. However, there was no recall because it wasn't a safety issue. I purchased this in April 2016 and likely got one of the older stock.I apologize for initially giving this a 5-star rating and hopefully didn't lead someone down the same road. Again, there are many reasons why a car could be acting the way mine is, so you'll have to do some investigation your car's performance isn't what you remember. This information I provided might lead you to an easier, and less costly solution.ORIGINAL PRODUCT REVIEW : May 2016I purchased this item to fix a leaking gasket. I know, sounds strange to buy the entire cover when all I needed was a gasket. But wait, there's a reason I did just that. The holes in the cover contain rubber o-rings that slide over the metal tubes that cover the spark plugs. This rubber hardens just like the valve cover gasket and can fail, which leads to oil being deposited into the spark plug tubes. The o-rings aren't replaceable so I opted to replace the entire item instead of potentially doing the same work twice.This unit felt and fit just like the OEM unit. The valve cover gasket is included. There are videos on-line where people put RTV silicone on both sides of the entire gasket surface. This is incorrect according to Nissan mechanics and other documentation. They are correct in stating that a small amount of RTV is needed only at the two corners where the gasket makes a sharp directional change. Looking at the engine from the front, the corners that need RTV are the ones on the left. As verification, I noticed there was silicone only at these two corners when I removed the OEM unit. A few inches beyond the corners is all that's needed. As for the RTV, I used Permatex Ultra Black mostly because it remains pliable and is oil resistant.

These are lenses only, I was going to go LED but I guess I read too many bad reviews about rapid flashing blinkers, short life bulbs, ect.These look really modern to me, the only thing I don't really care for is they don't have much reflector power for when your lights are off.See picture, left is stock and the right one is the new one, the stock light has reflector all around the perimeter this new one is just in the middle.

I almost ended up on my rear in a parking lot.  Less than 24 hours after install, I was getting into my jeep using the handle to pull myself in and... *POP!* It could have been bad.  I was lucky a third of my rear hit the corner of my seat.  If more rear missed the seat I would have fallen hind quarter first straight to the ground from a lifted Jeep.Do yourself a favor and spend more money on better handles.

UPDATE:I sent an email to Trico and they replied very quickly. They explained that the vertebra (metal reinforcement) is intentionally wider to create a tighter fit. If your refills are getting stuck as mine were, pinch the sides of the metal strip together as you slide the refill into the arm's guides. There is a slight void in the metal center and they will narrow when you do this.  The areas to pinch together are circled in my pics.Then they went right in!Good fit - good customer service !!Thanks Trico.Original Review:In my car, the refills begin to slide in, nice and snug as they should.  They go about 4", and then they get stuck and will not slide further.  This is on a 1978 Oldsmobile Delta 88 that has Trico wiper assemblies on it.When you look at the metal frame, it is not cut straight.  There are spots where it significantly widens and that's where it jams.  Please see the pics attached.I ordered a second set, thinking I got one bad set.  They are the same.I will update this review when I figure out if the problem is something I am doing vs an actual product defect.Thanks for anyone's help/comments.

I was so excited when I received my iCarsoft POR-II scanner. I take my Porsche 911 (991) to the dealer for most work, but a lot of small maintenance items I do myself. I wanted to reset the intermediate service message, something the POR-II is supposed to be able to do, however after plugging it in to my car it became apparent that the firmware on the tool was really old and lacking the ability to reset the intermediate service message. Not a problem, the POR-II is updatable so I got online trying to find the "serial products update tool". After multiple broken links I found the software. Following the manual I couldn't get past the initial screen where the serial number is requested, the update button would not do anything. I went online to research the issues, some users suggested inserting the TF card before running the application, that allowed the tool to auto load my serial number but once again, clicking the submit/update button did absolutely nothing. I'm sure this is a great tool when updated, but the model/version I received does not work and I can't find a way to update the scanner. Even the the oil reminder reset appears to behave differently, requiring the user to perform several manual actions such as fiddling with the odometer reset button (see photos). I ordered from etailz (shipped by Amazon).

I connected this to both of our newer model cars and I was able to pair with my phone. It only takes a second to install.Everyone should have this, regardless of whether or not you are a do it yourself type when it comes to vehicles. For those that work on their own vehicle, they can easily get vehicle computer information and error codes with this device. For those that need to hire a mechanic, they won't get ripped off by knowing beforehand what the vehicle computer is reporting.This worked fine with the Android Torque app - with lots of real time information. It will display live information such as speed, current MPG, air temp, engine temp, air flow, RPMs and much more that I have only begun to check out. I look forward to someday when I'm riding as a passenger to check out everything that this device can report. I have not had any vehicle issues, so have not tested error code readings.I received this product for a discount or free in exchange for a honest and unbiased review. I believe reviews are an important aspect on Amazon and you can trust this review as reliable.

I've owned these for a couple weeks now and have been very pleased so far! You can't beat the price and they do the same thing as any WeatherTech ones would do. I put these in my 2001 VW GTI and I had to do some trimming on the driver side to get them to fit, but nothing extreme and it doesn't look bad.The color is deeper than I expected, they were not as thick as I imagined, and I have noticed that the grooves can sometimes catch the heel of your shoe, but not dangerously.

I like them, they're smaller and narrower than the factory, so the latch now looks smaller, it's not a perfect color, nor size, but it seems quality rubber and the bolts were quality fit and finish - 12 minutes start to finish for deconstruction and reconstruction so that was nice

These battery terminals are awesome! I needed something more heavy duty, that you can bolt larger extra wires to, and you can get the larger longer bolt pretty tight, to not have to worry about t oming loose, which was happening on my other terminals with smaller bolts. The negative also squeezes pretty tight to my battery disconnect. This also was a problem on a different brand. I bought another set of these military terminals for my 68 charger.

So if you own a piece a crap cobalt then you have found your way here to this Amazon listing....My car has been experiencing the whole "engine power reduced" issue for quite some time now any time it gets the slightest bit cold out so we researched around and found that it was likely the throttle body. Having figured that out, my mechanic cleaned my original for me for no charge to see if that would help. It did for a bit but it soon came right back this year (had this done last winter) so we then went in search of of one of these things. I used to work at the local parts store so we naturally check there first. We were going to pull the trigger on that one but I am an Amazon nut and always check here before buying, well, anything! It was significantly cheaper on here which in turn taught me two important lessons..1) Always check Amazon firstAnd2) Almost always get parts on Amazon (especially if you have prime)So far not one code has popped up so I'm pretty excited about that. NOW my car is having an issue with stalling out on idle. Nothing to do with this just needed to say that to further explain my reasoning for calling it the a pile...as all cobalt are. Pretty sure they should all be in the scrap yard resting peacefully under a point of iron and bird crap....just my opinion...lolONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION....If you are new to buying parts on Amazon, DON'T listen to their "suggestions"...We bought this and it recommended 2 seals as well so we purchased all three....yeah....only needed one. Luckily I put in a return for one seal and they told me to keep the product and issued me a refund immediately...But just look up what you need. Don't take their word for it. I have included a picture of the "recommendation" I'm talking about...the one NOT to listen to....

The lights work as advertised however the mounting hardware is not stainless steel and they are rusting to pieces.  I installed them in the spring of this year and I need to get motivated to replace all the hardware while it can still be removed with a wrench and not a torch.Do yourself a favor and change the hardware out first and repaint the mount with some rustproofing as well or you'll be in the same position before you know it.

I own a 1949 Chevy pickup. The brake light bulbs that came with the new tail light assembly are very small due to the space inside the assembly. I was told by many folks they could not see my brake lights at intersections. NOT any more. These tail lights have LEDs not just on the sides but even on the top. They are super bright. So if anyone runs into the back of my truck, it won't be because they couldn't my brake lights. I'll be looking for the turn signal/parking light combo.

Purchased this for a 2007 Tahoe.  I generally keep the 3rd row installed, but in the lifted position to allow for more cargo.The mat itself is good quality.  The material appears to be of suitable thickness and durability for the application.  The mat came rolled up and took about 20 minutes in moderate temperatures to flatten out.  You can see in the pictures that the edges still curl up a bit.The mat includes flat spots/cutout areas if you are going to use the third row.  I laid the mat on the flattened delivery box and used a sharp utility knife to cut out openings for the tracks and bars.  It only took about 10 minutes to cut the appropriate spots out.  In the attached pictures you can see what the mat looks like without the 3rd row installed, with the third row installed and raised, and with the third row down for seating.The product only gets 2 stars because it is essentially useless for those who use a third row.  You end up cutting out about 50% of the usable area of the mat.  I will be surprised if this keeps a leak from getting below the mat because the leaking item must be in the "right" place.  The pictures don't really portray how dramatically the cutouts reduce coverage.  There's a ridge around each of the cutouts.I wish the manufacturer had tightened the openings a bit, especially around the bars in the middle of the picture.  If I had to do it again, I would put the mat in the back and mark the positions of the bars.  I would then cutout small sections until the seat latched properly.  Even then, if something dripped "inside" the ridge, it would flow below the mat and into the depression.  I would do the same for the tracks.Is the mat made of good material?  Yes.  Will the ridges around the perimeter and cutouts retain spills, yes.  Is this a practical solution, no.

Mirrors fit my Xterra perfectly after some adjustment. Very snug, no vibration or slipping at all. Just what I needed for towing a 25ft camper. My only concern is that the ratcheting mechanisms are mostly plastic, so you have to be careful not to overtighten. Good buy.

Exactly what I needed for my 2012 Chevrolet Cruze 1.4 Turbo. I had a coolant leak and thought it was my upper coolant hose so I had replaced that because it didn't see any cracks at the time. I really didn't need to do that, but it became a giant leak from upper coolant house outlet. The plastic had given way at the seam and crushed. My picture shows how bad it really was. My guess is when I had my turbo replaced from that failing at 50k miles, the shop had massacred coolant outlet.Somewhat difficult fix for a $22 part. If you don't know what you're doing with cars, don't bother because you'll do more harm then good. Lots of hoses inolved and you have to drain coolant from underneath the car.  Took me about about 1 hour for everything. Make sure you have coolant on hand after you drain your coolant.

I recently upgraded the stereo head unit in my 2004 Mazda mx-5 Miata. The new stereo has a 6.2 inch touchscreen and fits a double DIN opening. The stereo came with mounting brackets and rubber stopper for mounting the rear but it soon became apparent that it would not fit. It was too small for the opening in the dash by almost an inch.A quick look online showed that I actually needed an install kit for the replacement stereo. The Metra 99-7505 seems to be a general purpose Mazda kit that fits several vehicle models spanning the years 1994  2006. I ordered the kit on Amazon which was less than half the price most places were selling it for.The KitThe kit arrived in a bag with a small folded instruction leaflet inside. I was surprised that you actually get two kits in one. A single DIN stereo kit with cubby hole which comes as a single piece and can be flipped so the cubby hole can either be either below or above the stereo. You also get the Double DIN kit which is the one I wanted.The Double Din Kit comes in three parts: the front bezel and two separate side brackets. No other hardware is included; you're expected to use whatever comes with the stereo.InstallThe installation is fairly straightforward. If anything, the instructions hampered the install. There are diagrams but they don't really illustrate which way around the bezel goes so its possible the bezel is upside down. The brackets have circles with embossed letters that indicate which bracket is for the left (L) and Right (R). In the end, the easiest way tell if the bezel is the correct way is when you try and line up the screw holes. They don't line up if the bezel is upside down.The only other thing is that the bezel has a horizontal support across the double opening. You have to remove this beam. I used side cutters and a modelers small flat file to remove and finish the surface. The moulding didn't try to make the job easier and the beam is flush with the front bevel so some care has to be taken if you don't want any visible signs of the cut after you install the radio. Its not hard if you have some basic tools.Fit and finishOnce the radio is attached to the kit and the wire harness hooked up, you simply slide it into the opening. There are four expanding latches on the kit that snap into place when the radio is inserted all the way. It fits snug and flush to the dash and looks clean and tidy. So long as your stereo came with the rubber bump stop mount on the back then the radio will fit snug and doesnt rattle.ConclusionThe kit works well and is relatively easy to use with some common sense. Intuition works better than the included instructions. I actually had to remove the stereo again the next day to troubleshoot a potential problem. The kit recommends a general purpose Ford head removal kit which is incorrect and a bit silly if you don't have a Ford stereo. The easiest way to remove the stereo is to undo 4 screws and move the center console (that takes about 4 minutes) undo 2 screws and unclip the dash panel (takes about 2 minutes) and then you can push a large flat head screwdriver into the slots the dash kit latches into. If you unlatch the two top ones the stereo will tip forwards and then you can just raise it slightly while pulling and the stereo comes out easily.Other than vague instructions and some basic crafting skills, the dash kit is easy to install and works well. Now that it is in Im pretty happy with it. The plastics match in color and though the front is textured and doesnt match the aluminum finished surround panel, I didn't really expect it too. Im pleased with the results which you can see in the pictures.

I bought this for my mini bike and it doesnt fit. They are too big for the mini bikes fork. However, if i put foam to cover the spaces it works fine.

Looks to be in great shape. The bolts were too short to mount to my hitch. I have a three ball hitch and the 4th side is empty - so i figured i'll install this hook on it without having to replace the whole hitch assembly (saving money where ever I can). There's an item that is the same as this item but without the bolts for two dollars less. I should have done that instead - now I have to go buy some bolts that are rated for 10,000lbs!Update. Woke up this am and went str8 to Lowes. For $6, got two grade 8 3.5" bolts, nuts, and lock washers. Ive updated with new photos of the installed product. Im a happy camper! Now lets find a tree to pull ;)

Easy to install, make sure to separate letters.  Take care on the "R" as when I removed the masking they almost tore. Also watch the thin parts of the "C" to make sure they are lined up straight.  Not a bad look, mutes the shiny chrome a little which I wanted to do.

I have used this to lift two different generators that weight about 250 lbs and the lift worked great.  I also used it to lift concreted fence posts out of the ground. See pics.  This thing is great.

Works well but has started to show design flaws 2 years in. Has always started my vehicles when they are dead, holds a charge for a long time, overall very impressed with the electronics. However, after 2 years of infrequent use, the two pieces of plastic (grey and black) have started to separate near the light end of the device. There's about a 3mm gap. I had expected better. Still works, but definitely not sealed to the elements.I also had to cut the flaps down on the charge ports because there was too much strain and they wouldn't stay in place.

After reading previous reviews, i was very careful not to get any gasoline on the lens.  So far, it looks good and works well.  Although, since I am relying on this gauge to measure pressure I cannot actually speak regarding its accuracy as this is the only gauge I have.  I am left to assume the pressure reading is accurate and correct.

This review is for the Smoked LED amber turn signals. The plastic clips on one of the housings was misaligned and made install a bit of a pain. But beyond that, in my 2014 Jeep JKU rubicon, the computer thinks the front turn signals are out,and that cases the fast blinking and dash issues. Would like to swap them out and will update if the new set continues to have the same issues.

Ok so I thought the brush would be great ...and its not so much. I really like the overall size of the brush. Does make it easy to hold and use on smaller areas. The thing that makes this really poor is the bristles .. or lack of. If you were to turn it over you would see spaced out rows of grouped bristles instead of a flat pad of bristles, which you can kind of see in one of the product pictures, but is much more pronounced when you have it in your hand looking at it. This really makes it pretty poor to use, it just needs more bristles on it. The bristles stiffness is pretty good. It is stiffer than a leather cleaning horse hair brush and softer than an OXOX cleaning brush you can get at walmart. I used it today to clean the vinyl/leather combo on door panels and then on a dash and it really didn't do well at all. It did fling cleaning solution a lot due to the spaces between each group of bristles and didn't really get the dirt out of the texture of the panels/dash I was cleaning. This brush also didn't make the all purpose cleaner foam up at all. I switched to another different brush that I had and it did foam up the cleaner while seeming to scrub dirt out of the texture on the surface better and faster on the same areas I was trying with this brush.I then tried this brush on my leather seats and it again did not do well compared to my bigger horse hair leather cleaning brush I have. Same results as on the panels above. The brush didn't foam the cleaner and just didn't clean the surface texture well or quickly. I had to use the other brush I had to finish the job. I did notice that it does pretty good at getting the dirt particles out of the creases of leather seats.I was mainly trying to find something scaled down in size compared to the full size leather brush but with slightly stiffer bristles than the full sized leather horse hair brush, and use it for leather and vinyl surfaces, while being able to get into the tighter areas like the door panels and dash have, and this is not it by any means at all.I have added a picture to show the rows of bristles.

Love this cover. It matches my CURT hitch and provides plenty of protection. To insert the pin I need to apply some forward pressure on the cover to line up pin holes. Rubber gasket on the back side of the cover seals off hitch receiver from elements. Real CURT quality!

There are plenty of reviews about other aspects, so I just wanted to provide the results from my tests regarding the battery capacity when outputting at 5v (USB) in mAh, which most seem to be interested in knowing.To my surprise, the results were pretty poor. And I love Noco, and hold them in high regard (still do), but they let the ball drop on the 5v output. I had issues keeping the voltage above 4.5v when drawing anything over 1A, which is pretty bad. It should be 5v. Maybe 4.85v when drawing closer to 2A would be acceptable, but it wouldn't even provide so much. I didn't even bother to test what the capacity was with current draws of 1.5 or 2A, which the unit should have been able to put out.I did two tests using a dummy load and a USB monitor. Basically, the test measures how many mAh it can put out at a given amperage. Given how the voltage drop was huge (a very poor result regarding voltage drop), I only tried at 1 Amp. I was able to get 3800 mAh on the first test, and 3887mAh (18.13Wh) on the second test. That's a pretty average result, but considering how big this unit is, I would have wanted to see more. Your typical 6000mAh (advertised) USB Power Pack tends to put out around 4000mAh, and they are about 1/4th of the size.So basically, if you want to use it to jump start cars in an emergency, and occasionally charge devices, I have a hard time justifying this over other (cheaper) options. If it weren't for that voltage drop you could at least argue it's high quality, but after seeing that, I can't even be so sure. I'd almost want to believe I have a defective cable, or a defective unit, but who knows.As it stands, Noco is still my go to brand for chargers, but I think I'm going to pass on this specific product for the meanwhile.

I bought this Optima RedTop battery back in 2010 for my 1970 John Deere Model 120 tractor.  For many years I had been replacing the OEM battery with a genuine Deere battery (Part #TY6181) because it's an odd size and only JD dealers carried it.  I was lucky to get two seasons out of those $100 batteries, even if I left a trickle charger on it over the winter.  After spending probably $1,000 on JD batteries over the years I had to try something different.  I learned on an online forum that other Deere owners had luck with this Optima Group Size 35 battery, which is fairly close in size to the OEM one.  So I bought one here on Amazon, and it's given me four years of excellent service so far.  It works perfectly for my application and it's definitely saving me money.

First off, I would like to say that these bulbs actually arrived before Amazons estimated delivery date by two weeks. These bulbs came shipped in a protective static proof bag to protect them during shipment. This type of bulb is typically used as side marker lights and tag lights on vehicles or other types of clearance or running lights. There are a total of five LED chips on this bulb. There are four surrounding the outer perimeter of the bulb and one on the end of the bulb. Being that these lights are blue, they shouldnt be used for side marker lights. In my video, I showed what the effect is by placing this bulb under one of the red side marker light lens. The bulbs are a really bright blue but the light is pretty much canceled out by the red lens. These bulbs will be perfect, however, for the tag lights, which are under a clear lens. These bulbs will also work well behind the instrument panel on my dash. One thing that I noticed about the bulb is that they are polarity sensitive bulbs. I first plugged on in and it didn't work. I took the bulb out and turned it around, plugged it back in and it came on. I have noticed this before with some LED bulbs. As most U.S. made cars have a 12VDC electrical system, most of the systems in the car are very polarity sensitive. Simply turning the bulb 180 degrees will correct the polarity problem.  I own a customized 2002 blue Chevy Blazer XTreme and these bulbs are the perfect accent for it.  Why should I not be just as pleased with their 194 bulbs?  I am super pleased with these bulbs. The bulb is super bright and, in my case, easy to replace. In my particular application, simply reaching under the bumper and unplugging the bulb holder, replacing the bulb, and reinstalling it. Each vehicle and application will be different but the actual bulb replacement was very easy. I received these Trisense 12 volt  194 bulbs at a discount, or free, for my unbiased testing and review. You won't be disappointed!

I am huge fan of AMP Research products.  I have their BedStep 2 and PowerSteps installed on my 2015 GMC Sierra Denali.  The fit, finish, and quality is simply second to none.  This product is no different.  Like all of their other products, this looks like it should be an OEM product.  It is durable yet very light.  Easy to remove and also fits in the back seat in case you ever find yourself out and about and need to remove it.  The straps hook right into the tailgate latches and when it's latched, this thing does not move.I can't say enough good things about these products and I am looking forward to the next cool thing they come out with!

My last Camco Rhino Flex 15' sewer hose was damaged so I ordered another one,these were the best on the marker but like a lot of other things they just get cheaper. A lot of the sewer connections are in  a depressed concrete basin. Our Rhino Flex right angle connector drags on the concrete before the threads are snug, or sometimes even before I can get the threads started. The new one has a shorter connector than the older one,making it almost impossible to hook up. In the picture you can see the difference between the 2. The one on the left is the old one compared the new one on the right.  I am glad I kept the old one so now I can hook up to some but with the new one it would be impossible. To bad they cheeped out!It was a very good and useful product now not so much.

We bought this for a 2500 mile round trip to Florida.  It performed great and had lots of room.  When I loaded in NJ it was freezing and bag was in garage, made it tough to handle and zipper.  In Florida that wasn't a problem and was easy to handle and zipper.  It held two full size suit cases, one smaller suitcase, and two duffle bags and still has room.  I didn't want to pack it too full to block lights or plate totally.  I didn't use supplier straps.  Looked like a pain.  I used my own straps, was easy to secure and open with my straps.  It's flexible enought to squish down if not full, which I think is easier to strap down with other straps too.  On the way back there was rain and snow and freezing rain.  Bag kept everything dry.  I def recommend this bag.  Rola couldn't answer simple questions about their product so i choose this bag.  Glad I did.

I have a zerk fitting that is in a difficult spot.  Be sides that the standard coupler wouldn't fit, I couldn't hit the zerk fitting head on either.  I have to go in at a slight angle, which made this job a real challenge.I bought two other types of adapters from local auto parts stores without any success.One was the rubber tip, and the other was 4" needle adapter.  Both failed.  Rubber tip couldn't hold the pressure, leak grease around the rubber edge.  The 4" needle adapter was too long and the tip angle was too wide.Bought Lincoln needle nozzle next and it was perfect for this.  The tip was narrow, sharper angle, and the right length.  It fits on my grease pump without any problems.  I was really happy that I got the ball joint greased up.  I would buy this again.

For under $200 its great. I got a silver visor and put the pinlock anti fog insert in it. I tried to make it foggy,  I mean really huffing and puffing and nothing. No fog. I also added the chin curtain and it cut some serious decibels off the sound. It also cut down the ventilation a bit. Still, 80+ degrees, multiple rides around 2 hours and it great. It could be better, but it could also be $800. So. I'm glad i got one. I may upgrade to a more pricey helmet one day but this one is gonna be around for awhile.

I GOTTA SAY THIS LIL SCANNER IS GREAT.. WORKED PERFECT ON A FEW CARS AND TURNED OFF LIGHT FOR THE TIME BEING TILL THE PARTS COME IN... I JUST HATE SEEING THE LIGHT ON... COMES WITH THE BOOK AND CD... PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THOWING BOTH ITEMS AWAY... THE BOOK IS A NICE QUICK REFERENCE TO REFLECT.. FURTHER THE DIAGNOSIS ON LINE IS FINE BUT THE BOOK IS A GOOD REFERENCE TOOL TO KEEP IN THE GARAGE NOT THE GARBAGE.. DONT BE RETARDED... AT ANY NOTE THE OBD IS GREAT WORKS EXCELLENT REGARDING PEOPLES COMPLAINTS IS OPERATOR ERROR.. YOU HAVE TO PLUG IT IN WITH NOT EVEN THE KEY IN THE IGNITION... AFTER LIGHTING UP AND SET TO THE HOME SCREEN PUT THE KEY IN AND TURN ONLY TO ACC THE FUCTION JUST BEFORE STARTING... AT THE TIME THE READER IS READY TO SCAN AND WILL.. FEATURES THE OPTION TO READ VIN# OF ANY 2002 OR NEWER MODEL.. A QUICK METHOD TO  CONFIRM EVERYTHING MATCHES... AND FOR THE PRICE ITS A NO BRAINER.. THE ONLY FLOOR IS THE FACT ITS RED.. THE ONLY THINGS THAT EXCEPT RED ARE TAMPONS & MORONS... I HATE RED.. BUT AWESOME OBD SCANNER SAVE TRIPS TO AUTOZONE AND SAVE MONEY WITH THE AUTEL MAXISCAN OBD CODE READER....

After watching several videos and reading reviews on several different DA Polishers I went with the Torq 10FX Package from Chemical Guys. I just used this machine and I'm Very pleased with it. It has little vibration and very easy to use. It feels heavy until you actually put it to use, the balance and weight let you use it without having to use much downward pressure. I started with the V36 and them went to the V38 and couldn't believe the finish I achieved. My car had the typical scratches and swirls from prior poor washing from the previous owner. I spent about an hour on my hood and can't wait to do the rest of my car. My car looks like it's new ( probably better then new) and its 3 years old. I took some pictures of 50/50 with the left side polished and then the reflection of the finished hood. I would definitely recommend this product!

This bag is a total POS. I ride enduro almost every weekend and have had good bags and bad. This is not a quality KTM part. The last four weekends I have spent more time dealing with this bag falling off and breaking straps then riding. The top strap stitching completely ripped off yesterday during a ride. I would return this product to the low quality factor it was made in if I could with a note to take a look at other tail bags in the industry and learn a few things. Not what I expect from KTM brand or the company. VERY disappointed!!!!

Due to these reviews indicating possible problems with other components and youtube videos demonstrating some difficulties installing these, I had a shop install them while I watched.  Impact screw driver needed and the right rear caliper was blown.  Part was $60.  Took the shop less than 2 hours to replace and avoided all the the problems that would have occurred.  Brakes are now better than new and any complaint from the wife about excessive noise are gone.  The pads were replaced by me in June(front) and September(rear) with lifetime guarantee.  Exchanging next year and may use in a few years.  2005 Acura TL 165,000 miles. Total cost was around 500.  Acura dealer would have charged $1500.

Operating in the UHF range, these wireless key finders will not interfere with your router or any wifi or bluetooth devices. I tested mine and got every bit of 30 feet of range going downstairs through walls. 90 db is pretty loud so unless they are buried under covers you should be able to locate your keys etc with no problem. Lastly if you have any issue whatsoever, customer service cannot be matched. It will be made right. Great product. Great service. Can't go wrong with that. Photo attached. Sample for fair review.

Both of mine developed moisture inside of them within two months, even after I siliconed the edges to ensure no moisture would get in.Edit: the seller sent me one free one, so I will up the rating by a little, still leaves me with one light with moisture inside of it.Edit again: 3/4 light developed mosoture inside. Seller sent me the wrong replacement light anyways, it's labeled different and has a different light output, save your money and get something that'll seal good.

awsome lights, give off a good amount of light..however not enough to use by themselves. pretty easy to wire. lights were a little big for where i wanted to put them but thats my fault, i did manage to get them mounted nice and solid and they look great!!!!EDIT: 2/3/2012 Turns out my mounting location was not the greatest. i had them mounted behind the grille of my 02' f150. i have limited range of adjustability. just built a light bar for my bed topper and move these up. holy crap! these lights rock. so much more light output now that they are able to be adjusted and have a better angle. buying a 2nd set for the bar in the very near future.

4 of the 6 lights this kit replaces are very easy for even someone non-mechanically inclined to replace in a 2014 Civic.  The only ones I had difficulty with were the license plate lights, and that was because I could not remove the stock bulbs (the housing is small and I was afraid to smash/shatter the bulb...).  That is my fault, not a problem with the item.All of the LED bulbs were functional upon installation.  I've only had them installed for a few days, but I'm not very confident about their durability, as they are from China and their packaging suffers from numerous misspellings.  If their QC is not good enough to catch simple spelling errors (e.g. "Long Produt Lifee"), do they really use quality components?  Time will tell.  The main reason for my subtracting a star is that these lights do not seem quite as bright as the stock bulbs.  I'm leaving them installed for now, but I am keeping the stock bulbs handy in case I need to put them back in.

These lights were a welcome addition to my FJ Cruiser for more auxiliary lighting. Installation was easy if you are somewhat mechanically inclined. Installation took about 45 minutes. The kit came with everything needed to get you lit up and running! The packaging was good and delivery was fast! I would recommend these lights to anyone looking for an affordable alternative to much higher priced lighting systems.

Worked very well for replacing valve seals, keepers, and retainers on my BMW with the head still installed.  I did have to trim part of the silver interior  portion to fit my specific application however no big deal.  Can't expect it to fit EVERY head perfectly.  Once I squared that away, it was a breeze.It was not too hard on the hands after doing 24 M3 valves.  Might be more painful if you have extreme valve springs.Would recommend it for replacing parts valvetrain parts with your head still installed.  I used a leakdown tester to pressurize the combustion chamber to keep the valves closed.

Installed this on a 2007 Jeep Liberty.  It worked as expected.  The wire harness on the 2007 Jeep Liberty that this needs plugged into is located on the passenger's side rear cargo area under the plastic side panel.  You had to remove the rear door plastic floor trim and then just pop the side plastic panel off (you just pull on the panel starting near where you remove the rear door plastic floor strip).  It will be a little tight working without removing the whole panel but it can be done.  The car factory wires are a bit short adding to the tight area and one of the factory plastic clips has a red slide unlock and then you have to use a flat head screw on the back of it to get it loose.  I broke mine, but no big deal, I just added some tape to the factory plug and the new one to hold them tight.  The only thing I had to use a power tool on was to drill the self tapping ground screw into the metal of the vehicle near the plug. The install took about 15 to 20 minutes and most of that time was getting the factory plug undone (the one with the red plastic lock switch).  This was a pretty easy install.NOTE:  There is a rubber grommet on floor below the tail light that you can use to get the trailer connector plug outside the vehicle.  I just put a small cut in the rubber grommet and feed the trailer plug through the slit.  If you take the grommet clear out that would leave a silver dollar size hole in your floor behind a plastic panel where water could get in.

I have a jayco hybrid travel trailer.  The way the furnace vent is set up on the camper it is impossible to get this to stay put.  The spring clips are too long to have enough tension to keep it secure.  It was a complete waste of money.  It may work on other setups.  I have attached a picture of my furnace vent.

I thought this would be a cheap product made of plastic but when it came in the mail it was pretty heavy. Looks good on your jeep. You have to kind of shake the key to open it and one time I was trying to lock it back but the key wasn't turning so I sprayed wd-40 and it worked. Other than that good product.

Why I purchased the PROwattI bought this inverter to replace a cheap modified sinewave inverter for multipurpose use (i.e. family vacations, travel, etc.) The modified sinewave inverter was noisy. Any audio/video devices plugged into it had an annoying hum. Portable electronics such as iPhones or Androids charging through USB were particularly bad, with so much hum that earphones were unusable. So I bought the PROwatt sinewave inverter to solve those problems.Initial ImpressionsIt's big. Not heavy, but it's twice the size than other similarly-powered inverters. The PROwatt has a very simple input voltage display. The unit goes into undervoltage shutdown if the input votlage sags too low. Be sure your wires can support the currents the PROwatt can draw. A cigarette lighter is usually good for 150-200 Watts, so don't be surprised if the PROwatt shuts down early if you're using a cigarette lighter socket. This display also shows output power in kilowatts, which is essentially useless for a 600W unit.The PROwatt has as flimsy membrane power button. It needs to be manually actuated every time power is applied. Either locate the PROwatt so it is easy-to-reach, or separately purchase the remote power-on switch. I would not be surprised if many PROwatt failures are due to the flimsy button. Even brand-new, I sometimes need to hit the button a few times until it powers on. This is a failure waiting to happen.The 12V input terminals are beefy and inspires confidence that they will last. Since they protrude from the back of the PROwatt, take care the unit is not positioned by anything metal or conductive. If you leave this in the floorboard of your car, expect it to slide under your seat and short-circuit on something. If you bolt it down in your trunk, make sure your tire iron or can of fix-a-flat doesnt roll into the exposed terminals and short-circuit your cars electrical system.MeasurementsThe PROwatt was tested on my lab bench using a Keysight 34481A and an&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/AGILENT-TECHNOLOGIES-DSOX2002A-OSCILLOSCOPE-2-ANLG-70MHZ-1GSPS/dp/B00DED64G4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES DSOX2002A OSCILLOSCOPE, 2 ANLG, 70MHZ, 1GSPS</a>&nbsp;oscilloscope. Data was measured then processed in MATLAB to determine frequency content. The PROwatt was powered by a 13.6V power supply buffered through an AGM lead-acid battery. The load was a 335W resistive load bank.The PROwatt had a somewhat clean 60Hz sine wave at no load. The voltage measured 123VAC. The 34481A reported the frequency at 59.8Hz, so the PROwatt should not be used for highly frequency-dependent devices (i.e. motor powered clocks or telescope alignment devices). See attached screenshot for no-load sine wave. The sine wave has some distortion present, which I wondered would be audible.I attached a pair of Bose Roommate powered speakers to the PROwatt. The speakers draw very little power at idle (a few watts). The PROwatt barely registered the load and the output sinewave stayed the same. The Bose speakers had an audible hum that was measured with an iPad Spectrum Analyzer app. The hum shows up at 120Hz at -60dB with following even-order harmonics at 240Hz and beyond. Not very loud, but audible nonetheless. iPad Screenshot attached. It doesnt sound like a ground loop (60Hz hum). Instead, it is a nastier sounding hum with higher-frequency components. The PROwatt should not be used to power outdoor or high-efficiency sound systems, because the hum would be audible and undesirable.The next test was to measure the hum produced by the PROwatt to devices charging over USB. Modified sine wave inverters have a big problem with this. An iPhone and charger was connected to the PROwatt. This draws very little power and PROwatt barely noticed. I connected&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bose-QuietComfort-3-Acoustic-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-Black/dp/B0081XAXXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bose QuietComfort 3 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones, Black</a>&nbsp;headphones and a battery-powered&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/FiiO-E11K-Portable-Headphone-Amplifier-Black/dp/B00MFMW29I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">FiiO E11K Portable Headphone Amplifier (Black)</a>&nbsp;to the iPhone when charging with the PROwatt. I could not hear any hum. Since it was under the audible threshold, I did not make any measurements.When loaded with 335W resistive load, the PROwatt output got significantly more nasty, with both even and odd order harmonics.  Screenshots attached. The output waveform gets asymmetrically squashed, producing broad-spectrum distortion byproducts. Many audio/video systems would be adversely affected by this strong distortion. Professional audio amplifiers with high-efficiency switch-mode suppliers (i.e. the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Crown-XLS1000-Power-Amplifier/dp/B003HZPKSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Crown XLS1000 Power Amplifier</a>) might be immune, but be careful to not exceed the PROwatts maximum output power. The PROwatt would more likely be used with signal sources (mixers, preamplifiers, power speakers), which are more susceptible to the PROwatts high output distortion.During the 335W testing, the output votlage dropped slightly to 119VAC. The fan was slightly noisy but won't be bothersome in a moving vehicle, especially if the PROwatt is mounted in an inconspicuous location.ConclusionsAlthough not producing a clean ideal sinewave, especially within its operating power band, the PROwatt is clean enough to satisfy many usage scenarios. I envision this inverter might have problems with powering larger A/V systems without introducing audible hum or visible distortion byproducts. This is a direct result of the squashed sine wave when under load. Other electronics, such as computers or laptops, should have no problem whatsoever with the PROwatt.My return window closed a week before my laboratory testing. I would readily return the PROwatt in exchange for a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Samlex-600W-Pure-Sine-Wave-Inverter-PST-600-12/dp/B00AYH6BSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Samlex 600W Pure Sine Wave Inverter PST-600-12</a>&nbsp;for the following reasons, but I guess I'm stuck with the PROwatt now. Don't buy the PROwatt until you  at least look at the Samlex, otherwise, you'll be stuck with something you don't want, like me. Buyer beware.- Flimsy power button vs. the Samalexs mechanical rocker switch.- Noisy output waveform- Lots of high frequency distortion harmonics

Assembly was complicated at first, but it only took around 25 min.  The results were amazing.  Aside from the louder sound (A plus in my book) I had definite horsepower gains and improved gas mileage.  The biggest difference was with the accelerator response.  I gained an average of 4 MPG.  That's right 4MPG.  Ex - when I first installed, I floored it everywhere because it sounded good. I actually got 1 mpg more with the throttle open all the way with this air intake. (1mpg more compared to my normal (slowly accelerating)driving)

I have a 2015 2SS Camaro with auto trans and L99 engine W/AFM.  Fart Mode was less noticeable with the stock exhaust.  Once I put an axle-back system on, the fart mode was very noticeable!  Something had to be done about this!!  Not wanting to void my warranty with a tuner, I needed an alternative.  Enter the Range!!  Plug it in and AFM is completely disabled.  Pull it out and fart mode is back and the Dealer will never know if you need service.It is well documented that AFM does not save gas and it does more harm to the engine than good.  Take back your vehicle with the Range.  Get a full time V8 and avoid blowing up your motor.  Win/Win!!I have been using the Range for a couple of months in my Camaro and it works well.  I drive the car daily, so I do not remove it.  If the car was going to sit for several days, I'd remove it until I drive the car again.  The Range works as advertised and disables AFM immediately after you plug it in.  Now much else it say.  I recommend the Range to anyone looking to disable AFM and protect the health of their engine.EDIT: A few months after publishing my initial review, I need to take back a few wonderful things that I said about the Range.  FIRST:  It still works as advertised, BUT there are some undesired side effects!  With the Range installed, one time my Camaro would not start or do anything when I turned the key all the way.  It acted like the battery was dead.  I pulled it out, then the car started, but the check engine light came on.  Took the car to the dealer, and by then the computer had healed itself and there was no code.It happened again once about a month later, but no check engine light.  Today, the car would not start.  Pulled out the range and it started, but the power steering had an error and was not working properly, the Brake light, ABS light, and check engine were also on.  Drove it a few miles, shut it off and everything cleared out and the power steering started working again.  My friend has a Range and has experienced similar issues.  I have down-graded my original review from 5 stars to 2 stars.

Pretty much everything you need. Although a switch was in this kit, I used a separate switch that better suited my car. That said, it'd be nice if the wiring diagram showed which of the two switch wires was the supply vs. the load--the ground was obviously black.Plenty of wire length really too much in many cases for me which isn't terrible; however, I'd rather see the nylon plug located much closer to the relay. Since the plug end of the switch harness can't go through your grommet or bushing, it limits how much length you have in the cab and I was very close to having to extend the interior portion of the harness even though there was tons of extra on the other side of the connector.This was so much easier than wiring everything up myself like in the olden days.My pictures include my grounding point, where I mounted the relay, my grommet, and a gratuitous pic of my separately purchased lights in operation.

6/26/2013I was a little concerned about ordering this set after seeing several reviews indicating they only received ONE wire instead of the full twelve!  I rolled the dice and the entire set of twelve arrived in two days via Prime, just as expected.It is an authentic Bosch wire set with all twelve wires for my ML350 (six cylinders, two plugs each). Eight of the wires are the same length and four are slightly longer, exactly as they should be.It seems that whatever stock picking or shipping issues they had in the past have been fixed.  I would not hesitate to order!7/7/2013I installed new plugs & these wires over the holiday weekend.  I wanted to mention that these wired ARE labeled with the Mercedes letter codes that correspond to the engine block.  This makes knowing which wire goes to which plug & coil pack dirt simple.

Over the years, I have always bought the genuine GM cargo nets and pay over $40 for them. This time, I decided to try one a fraction of the price. I installed it today on my 2015 Impala LTZ and the quality and fit is just as good as the OEM GM part. The mounting hooks are already there, so installation was a breeze. If you notice, there are two mounting loops on each side, one for the upper hook and one for the lower. This design, like the GM cargo nets keep the net in place without swinging or getting wrapped up in itself.  I mention that because some on Amazon only come with one mounting loop per side. Check your application to see if you have two mounting hooks like the Impala. I would highly recommend buying this one over the GM brand. Save the $30 and go buy a big steak dinner with the savings.

For the price these hubcaps look and fit great! Unlike most other hubcaps that use that ring to stay on, these are secured by removing the lug nuts first, putting the hubcap on, and then putting the lug nuts back on. I jacked up each tire when doing this (on a completely flat surface). Very satisfied!

Doesn't fit my LEXX MXe with the silencer in. It is too large.Update 3/7/2017:I was asked "will it fit a 3 inch hole?"Answer is maybe. I own a Yamaha R6 track bike with a megaphone exhaust. It works perfect for that. The opening is 3 inches and the plug drops in with the streamer hanging out. Don't believe the folks that say "fits all 4 stoke  bike". It does not. But it does keep parts and tools from falling in my track bike.See my photos for fitment.

Absolutely perfect. I just replaced all 43 bulbs in my 40' toy hauler (inside only). These are the best choice for bulb replacements in your rv. I ordered the super bright warm white bulbs and they are slightly whiter than the stock incandescent bulbs, but really, really, really close. None were blue in hue or even close to blue. I can have all 43 going at the same time and no fan noise! Before, I would have 8 bulbs going and the fan would roar. I installed all 43 within 30 minutes or so and that was even with having to flip some and mess with the little wires on the end of others. Every single bulb worked perfect with not one single dud (Again, I did have to fenagle some, but still)! I purchased 60 of these to have extras and I have to say that these were one of the best purchases to upgrade my rv that I have bought! I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to convert over to leds. Very affordable and excellent quality!Also, I want to mention that I was originally looking at the disc type led replacements. The problem with those being flat are they won't illuminate and bounce off of the back of the housing like the original incandescent bulbs do. No one had mentioned that in other reviews and if you think about it, makes sense. I hope that helps those trying to pick between these and the flat, disc types.

Installed on 2015 Nissan Pathfinder and works perfectly, so far. Product looks pretty high quality and in pretty awesome shape...was expecting for it to be a bit ragged (bought it as used) however, it wasn't the case. Took me about 4 hours or so compare to others' 2 hour install...just wanted it to look like it came from the factory :). Feels good knowing that you have that added safety feature since my wife drives the vehicle most of the time. Will post pictures of the Pathfinder later and will update more product review to see how it holds up.

Bought these for my 84 toyota pickup after I rebuilt the motor. I may be polishing a turd, but in the wise words of Dave Chappelle, "I sprinkle diamonds on my food because it make my dookie twankle."These wheels showed up on my doorstep much quicker than I expected and were packaged nicely with a foam type bag around the wheel. The center caps are removable with an allen wrench which was included with mine. So, if you have locking hubs up front, they'll fit just fine. I took them in and had my tires mounted and balanced that day and seeing them on my hunka junk made me smile. They came with hub rings for each wheel, but were unused for my truck, but its nice to have them if you needed them.These wheels are a classic look that will continue to look good for years to come, unlike some of the silly trendy looks that are out there. Kinda like how people used to think it was cool to where those super baggy ass jeans, the kind you could fit like 2 people in each leg. That fad was pretty damn ridiculous.Anyways, I don't want to look back and picture myself being that big jean pant wearing goober, so I try to keep it classic. In this case, these classic 8-hole's. If you are one of those big jean pants wearing goober and I offended you......good, maybe someone should have slapped you when you put those dumb things on the first time and saved you from the embarrassing memories that you have today.

I have an 06 HONDA Ridgeline with dark beige interior.  I was fixing a bleach stain on the front carpet.  This was not an exact color match but it came so close to the original color I was very pleased.  Perhaps another application or a slightly darker "tan" would have done the trick.  Because there is a clear division between front and back in the truck, no one looking or buying would ever notice ... It came out that good

Recently I tried one of those "universal" shift knobs, seemed to work at first but got very loose after just a week, and by that point I misplaced the original. So I then went online and found out what size knob my 2000 Nissan xterra uses, then found this one. Which works perfect, feels great and looks good. I have a blue and black theme going on so its a great match. I would recommend.

They would not fit my 2011 Camaro SS.RS DRL's/fog's without some work.  The circuit board that is attached to the base wasn't trimmed down to match the base, size wise (see picture).  I used my Dremel and ground down that part and I got them to fit.  They do work and the color is just a tad lighter(blueish) than the Camaro's headlights.  Brightness is good, not great.  I'll report back if there are any issues with longevity.

This is a good deal for a set of stainless steel (lower T409 grade) bellowed up pipes. Installation was a major PITA. It ended up taking me all day as I ran into a lot of issues. The most difficult part about this job was getting the rusty bolts out, which I ended up having to cut off. Also, getting the turbo aligned to the collector was very frustrating.Do not install the turbo to pedestal mounting bolts when aligning the turbo to the collector and loosely connect the up pipes to the manifolds. I spent a couple of hours, sprawled out across the engine bay, just trying get the collector to mate to the turbo. After tearing everything back apart, I noticed the alignment pin on the collector was damaged/deformed. It appears to be a manufacturing defect where they applied too much pressure while pressing in the pin. So make sure everything bolts together prior to installing these - aligning the turbo to collector is difficult enough :). A second set of hands would have made this job 10x easier.Overall, this was well worth the money but I hope I never have to this job again.UPDATE: I've put about 10,000 miles since installing the up-pipes and they're still holding up very well. The cast iron collector has already rusted but I didn't prep it before installing it. The stainless pipes have turned a golden-brown color.

Installed on a 2006 Mercury Grand Marquis (mechanically identical to Crown Victoria). Fit perfectly.Installation took about an hour. I balanced the hitch on a floor jack to lift it into position, wiggled it into the desired spot, and marked hole locations with a paint marker. There is some wiggle room as the hitch's holes are slotted. You'll need to drill the 1/2" holes in your frame; I used a Harbor Freight stepped drill bit which went through the steel like butter even with a cheapo drill. Once that is done you fish the carriage bolts through the frame with square-holed washers that keep them from spinning. A wire-style fish tool is included and works well for the forward most holes. The rear holes didn't need it. I did need to slot the rear holes slightly to allow the head of the bolt to wiggle past the bumper impact absorber. Once the bolts hung through, I used the jack to lift the hitch into place. Installed two shims on the rear bolts to make it sit flush with the frame, and installed the nuts with Loctite.The completed assembly hangs just barely below the plastic bumper cover so it shouldn't rub unless yours is saggy from broken clips. I'm pleased with the unit and it seems stout.The kit includes extra hardware for different applications: extra shims, wedge shims for station wagon installations, and an exhaust hanger bolt with shims for Town Car exhausts.

Installed this in my 2007 subaru Forester. 36 sq feet is more than enough to do all the doors, the rear hatch, rear side panels, and still have some left over. On the doors, I opted to do the inside of the outer door skin as well as the inside as the inner door skin. I bought a small butane blow torch from Amazon and used it to heat up the material after lightly applying it. This improves adhesion and makes rolling it easier. You also need a small roller (get the wooden one) to apply this stuff. Cutting this is easy; use a utility knife or a pair of EMT shears. Finally, wear hand protection. I wore two layers of surgical gloves. The metal on the door skins is sharp, and this stuff is sticky and gets on your hands and clothes. You will not be able to get it off. And the better you apply it, the better it works. I was surprised at how much quieter my car is now. The Forester had absolutely no sound insulation before. Expect to spend about 2 hours per door.Road noise and noise from passing cars is reduced. This stuff works by changing the resonant frequencies of the sound waves. It is not necessary to cover 100% of the doors. 25% to 50% coverage is enough. As you work to put this on, you can tap or thump your doors to check your progress. Doors close with a solid, low frequency thump much like the door of a Lexus or BMW. There are fewer rattles than before, my stereo sounds better, and my sex life has improved. Just kidding about that last part, I don't have a sex life. However, I do notice wind noise more than before.

The carb is extremely close if not exact replacement of the original.  I have included a picture that shows slight differences as it fits on my Echo SRM 2100 trimmer.  The carb throttle was a little "sticky" when first attached to the motor but once running the throttle didn't stick.  I think the original Zama had a sting to make the throttle return to idle when lifting off of the trigger.  The good news is it fired up after a little extra priming to get fuel into the carb and then ran and kept the idle steady (something my old carb could no longer do.  The replacement was 3 minutes at the most.  Any non-mechanicl person can do this repair with a simple flat head screw driver.  And the price is amazing compared to taking the trimmer to the small engine shop.  This is the second 2 cycle tool I have replaced the carb instead of having serviced by the small engine shop and the device returned back to lift.  With ethanol it is so hard to keep these carbs running properly.  Buy with confidence.

I installed these bulbs as the reverse lights on a 2014 ram 2500. They are very good, very bright. I was honestly impressed with how bright and white they were. Just bought the same bulbs for my cargo lights.

Look awesome in Black, but somethings rotten in denmark....For one of the most popular trucks in America, Jeep grand Cherokee, I wanted a seamless look.  Still waiting on response from THULE.  In comparison to the fitted feet shown on the rubber feet "mushroom" out in "FITkit 3142" required for my 2014 JEEP WK with factory rails, for $500+ I expect a SWISS watch, not a Swedish fish. IDK what feet were used in the link, (Black Jeep) but they are not provided in the 3142 FitKit.  Check the link /pic.  http://www.rackoutfitters.com/jeep-grand-cherokee-thule-black-aeroblade-edge-roof-rack-11-15/ IMHO, the FitKit is a POS for $100, it is not a neat seamless look.I soooo regret not going with the USA made, Yakima Whispbar, but the MOPAR racks are THULE.  THose look like extension ladders are going to be hauled though. Check out the video "Installation of a Whispbar Flush Bar Roof Rack on a 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee"  its custom fitted for the JEEP WK, minimal fussy moving parts, only doesn't come in all Black, but probably worth the powder coating due to less cost about $460, and LESS aggravation.

The Michelin Power 2CT is the best tire I have ridden on so far. The grip on it is excellent. It has great grip at all lean angles and it is pretty good in rainy/wet condition. It is really better than the Dunlop's that came on my GSXR. Tire wear is going to vary best on your riding style and the condition of the roads in your area. I have seen on motorcycle forums that some people claim to get up to 7500 before needing to replace them and some say they only get 2500 mile out of them. For me I love the performance of the tire and also the look of it, so I will be buying them again.

Came with some paint bubbled and missing out of the box. I use it to pull a sailboat and it performs admirably. Easy install, although the bolts above the tailpipe may require some extra convincing as a result of corrosive exhaust exposure.

This mat is awesome. It is a perfect fit in my 2014 Santa Fe Sport 2.0T. The edges all fit tight allowing no debris under the mat. The Velcro-ish bottom holds the mat rock solid in place and the only way to adjust it is to pull the mat up and move it (it won't slide). The Velcro is not like the real stuff as it does not actually stick, and pulls up with no resistance(don't worry, it will not make your carpet fuzzy like a regular Velcro might. The surface is kind of a mix between foam and rubber, and I can't make a judgment on the durability as I have only had it for a week. This mat is thinner and lighter than weather tech and has fold creases making it easier to get into the storage compartments under the mat. Overall it is an excellent mat.

Overall it is a very sturdy screen to add a nice look and protection to the grill of your Jeep.  I purchased because of the good price and that the holes appeared to provide good protection without looking like it might restrict the airflow too much. I just installed this on a 2016 Wrangler Sport 2 Door.  I do not feel that the way the insert connects to the grill is the best.  I understand the concept and it does hold it in place, but I do feel it could move or rattle some. Using only the supplied brackets, the sections between them could easily be pushed in and tapping on it did make it rattle. I do not know if I would notice it in the cab, but I still would not want it to move around.  Also, the brackets used to mount the insert were not bent exactly perpendicular to each other, which took some additional bending to get a better fit.  Even with bending it some more, the bracket still did not sit flat against the insert and made have contributed to the looseness I felt. I good fix might be to add an additional bracket. As it was I added some of these with some zip ties between the grill slats...these worked great and firmly held the insert. https://www.amazon.com/Mounting-100-Pack-Black-Speciality-Cable/dp/B01KVVS6B2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1491075637&sr=8-1&keywords=1+inch+cable+tie+mountSome reviews comment on the top bolt of the brackets pushing the grill up some. It does, but I was able to get it to fit by pulling up on the grill while it was being inserted.  Not the prettiest solution but it is what it is.  I have included some photos of the issues and solutions.

I bought these bulbs through a different company but the results were the same.I had replaced my 9006 bulbs that were silverstar ultras on my 2010 charger.The modification of the bulb was super easy with a pair of nail clippers. And took me all of five minutes. I wore new gloves to prevent my oils from getting on the bulbs. The passenger side went in super easy and was done in just a couple minutes. The driver side...was a whole other story.The clip was cut down to perfect size but the brackets from a 9006 and 9012 are different. As you can see the 9012 makes a L sort of a shape where as the 9006 plugs straight in. The workable space of the where to plug my headlight in was uneven on the driver side, meaning the 9012 connection rubbed against the wall of the headlight bracket or housing. The bulb fit by itself but with the power plugged in there was just too little of space. So I took another approach and pretty much ghetto rigged and jammed it til it stuck after trying to make it work for 2 hours. It seems to have held up fine and hasn't moved and I've been on bumpy roads and through storms.Now for the actual light review.Simply incredible. Night and day difference. While the light emitted may not be as white as the silver stars, this light projects further, wider, and higher than them. I can read road signs on the freeway with ease, I can see to the sides of my car and down the road multiple car lengths further. I will absolutely buy again.I attached one picture. You be the judge. You can tell which shows more on the road.

These relays are having a melt down @ 30 amp constant each im using 2 for a total of 60 amp charge for solar. Yes the plastic is melting and also taking the plug with it. I suppose ill see how long they last and leave it at that and i guess its a good thing i have 3 extras and to save them im going to have to spend more money on splitting one input to two to share the load for no more then 15 amp each constant.80 amp my a**.5 months later i had to change them just wanted to see how long they would hold up.

The suction cup mounts would have positioned it too low on the windshield, so I went with upholstery clips and mounted it to the headliner. However, I wouldn't recommend this, as the light is heavy and might pull the front lip of your headliner down. This length is not really designed for front windshield use, but with enough creativity anything can be accomplished.This light is VERY bright, which is always a concern when buying a light bar in this price range. You will not be disappointed at all. It is very bright and plenty visible during the day and insanely bright at night. It is actually hard to look at after dark! For comparison in the attached video, the small dash light is a Whelen Slimlighter (a $250 - $300 light). The video was taken in direct sunlight on a very sunny day. I'd say this light holds its own.The light comes with hardware for several different mounting options. It comes with 2 "L" brackets which screw into the ends of the bar for permanent mounting and 2 suction cup brackets which can be moved around the length of the bar. I have a larger size version of this bar in the rear window and I will say that the suction cups hold very securely. The included brackets will NOT work if you're trying to mount this with suction cups to the rear window of a pickup. You'll have to find a way to extend the brackets just an inch or so.The light has plenty of selectable patterns, 13 I believe. Anything from "all on" solid to right-left, left-right, and some patterns that might cause seizures. Seriously. At night, the white LED's overpower the ambers so be aware of that. It appears to be all white when looking directly at it at night. The light does produce a small amount of electrical noise when it's on. Nothing too noticeable and doesn't cause radio interference.My light came with the cigarette plug but I also ordered the hard-wire tail with the inline switch. The cigarette plug has been working fine for me. YES, the light remembers the last pattern selected whether you turn the light off or disconnect power. The cigarette plug has a momentary switch on it. Press once to turn light on, press repeatedly to cycle through patterns, press and hold for 3 seconds to turn light off. The included wiring was easily enough for my situation (Ford Ranger). The cigarette plug is well made and seems sturdy enough.The only thing I don't like about this light is the right-left/left-right directional pattern sequences are way too fast to be effective as a traffic advisor.Overall I am impressed with this light in this price range. It is not cheaply built and is extremely bright. I have had this on for 8-10 hours at a time for several months now and have not noticed any problems. I'm calling this one a great light at a great price!

These stickers are very high quality and they definitely turn heads. I used them to sticker-bomb the back of my motorcycles helmet. I was very happy with my decision to do so. The colors are vivid and they stick very well. Don't hesitate to buy these gems, they are worth every penny! I was very pleased with the variety of the pack.

My 2013 Prius 2 fit perfectly in my car. I was reluctant at first to buy this because I was not sure it was a good fit. I wanted the Weathertec but the price for that was way more than the Husky Brand. I read reviews the Weathertec was thicker and Husky was thinner. I did not want something too thick. I opted for Husky because it was more on my budget and I am glad I chose Husky, because I a very satisfied customer.

Works great, Ive only had it a couple weeks but so far it seems to be worth what I paid . Take note that when installing you should use 14 ga wire due to the 16 ga and smaller gets hot and can melt or even cause a fire .

I think these u-Box Front Fender Side Marker Amber LED Lights look sweet on my 2016 Jeep Wrangler.  I watched  video on Youtube for instructions on how to switch them out (yes because I'm a girl lol).  Removal of the old lights was fairly easy. However, I had a little bit of difficulty getting the lights back in. On the bottom of the lights there are two slot tab that the plastic piece from the Jeep need to fit into...I found it hard to get these back in.  You have to get the light at the right angle to the plastic piece in order for them to fit in the slots.  I actually ended up snapping the tab on the top of the lights trying to get the bottom slots in.  Even with the top tab gone, the lights still hold in place really well once everything is secured back down.  I'd highly recommend these lights to help upgrade your Jeep.I received the product at a discount in return for my unbiased opinion.

Only designed to hold a small coffee cup.  It is flat on the bottom and not tapered as it appears in the photo. Because the drink sits on top of the holder it makes it top heavy and could easily tip over while driving. Will not even hold a 24 oz drink. I bought it to fit my tapered 24 oz mug.  As you can see in the photos, it does not fit because it is just way too small and not tapered.

This LED switchback turn signals are super bright. Easy to install, i would suggest buying the wires that vome pre wired to cancel error on your panel. A set of capacitors come with the bulbs but if you don't wanna do any cutting or solicing on the wires look for tbis pre wired harness.

As you can see when I place a toy fan in front of the solar powered fan, the toy fan spins very fast.  The toy fan is actually spinning much faster than it appears to be spinning in the video.  I guess that the frame rate of the camera or video seems to make it appear as if it's spinning slow.The main downside to this fan is that I will have to remove the entire refrigerator to install the fan in the back, just below the cooling coils.  This is going to cost about $200.00 in labor.I installed the fan above the coils for one week, and the digital thermometers in both the freezer and refrigerator did not change one bit.  I'm disappointed that I did this installation, because I had to rip through the permanently mounted mesh screen at the top of the vent.  All of this, and it didn't work.  That's why I am going to have the refrigerator pulled out at the shop, and install the fan below the coils.On another note, it obviously does not work in the shade, and it is relatively loud.  When my body accidentally blocked the direct sunlight (similar to what a tree would do), the fan immediately stops spinning.  Of course shade is very different from a cloudy day, and at least one of the reviews notes that their fan still spins on a cloudy day.One of the most exciting aspects of this solar powered fan is that it is expandable to accommodate a total of two fans, as per the instructions that were included.  I plan to order the second solar panel and fan before I have the trailer shop pull out the refrigerator.

It was an easy install. The plug was a bit tight. Instructions in the box were very well written. The bulbs are white and bright. They are installed in our 2003 Nissan Frontier and my daughter drives it most of the time and likes them a lot. She says they are really nice. No flickering. The price was really cheap. Maybe cause it was a Dec deal. The picture is a comparison with my Jeep and Tundra.

How many times have I been driving and make a sharp turn or a quick stop and the stuff I store in the back, knock and bang around, sounding like I just got rear ended! F**k!, But, this net is perfect, it fits the right distance width, the clips go perfectly on my seat dropper hooks of my 'Nissan Versa Note SV' and keeps all my stuff nestled perfectly out of the way and slide-proof.

The water separator valve is by far the most likely culprit if you have a fuel leak in the engine valley. The newer diesel eats up the oem o-rings, rather than buy a new valve (about $45)- repair yours with these viton o-rings. The photo is not mine, just a generic google image, the drain valve is the yellow handle. Drain the fuel bowl (might as well change the filter while you're there), remove the 4 torx T20 screws, wiggle the valve off of the drain hose. Take a pick or push pin and pry out what is left of the old packings. Re-install with the T20 screws, new fuel filter if you choose, turn the key to on to prime the system, start truck and check for leaks.Tip: 1) You might want to disconnect the glow plug wire harness for extra hand room.  2) Make sure the valve is closed when you install (the yellow handle will point to the passenger tire).  3) the photo is looking at the back of the filter bowl assembly towards the front of the truck.

So far so good. I did not like the fact that the clips are all plastic, the flaps are smaller than i expected too but the look good and are defintely keeping my car cleaner. Install is no too difficult but seating the plastic clips properly behind the fenders is a bit of pain until you get the hang of it. If these were $100 i would have given 5 stars. Packaging was well done and enclosed instructions were excellent.

DO NOT BUY THIS! Even if it fits your vehicle. This part is very unsafe. The way this part has bolts/nuts to connect it at its coupler causes for the nuts to not stay tight, even with loctite. We put this on a customer's vehicle to avoid the $325 factory intermediate shaft on a 98 Durango. The bolts came loose on this part, causing the customer to loose steering and control of the vehicle. Luckily for us there was not an accident. We were left with a $300 tow bill, and then we had to order the factory MOPAR intermediate shaft at $325, not to mention the labor to reinstall. On top of that, when the shaft failed it made it so that the customer could turn the steering wheel as far as he wanted, and of course it got turned too far and broke the Clockspring...so I got to buy and replace that for him as well...Another $50 for that part, plus the labor time wasted. So, not only is this an unsafe part, but it will also cost you way more once you realize the bolts don't stay tight. Do not put anyone's family behind the wheel of a vehicle that has this part installed. The scary part is that when you search online for an aftermarket part, this is the most widely used brand for this application (as far as I could find). You will regret buying this part. I am just now in the process of trying to return this part via Amazon...but of course it was over 30 days ago, so I might get to eat the price of this shaft as well as the tow and the mopar shaft...and clockspring...Hopefully they will let me return it...

At first, I was very skeptical about the product. I thought it was a gimmick and the process seemed like very difficult. But I loved my new car so much that I was like wth. Let me tell you, this product is amazing, it's so forgiving that it's impossible for you to mess it up. My car right now has a mirror shine finish that I love it even more. After I let it cure for 48 hrs, I put on a coat of wax and let me tell you, it's like a mirror finish. I recommend it all the way, lets just hope it will last 2 years like it's said, then this liquid is as good as gold!

The product itself I like. I liked it well enough, that this is the second set I have purchased. My problem with this set is the color. I ordered beige. I got an almost olive khaki color. So unlike my first set which were black, the color does not run true. I am just going to use these in my work truck, and put the other set in my Tahoe. It isn't worth the aggrevation of sending them back. The hooks do work, the product is fine, just don't expect beige.

I have always been a fan of Battery Tender and own several of the 1.5 amp and .75 amp models.  And over the years they have worked exactly as advertised.  I have automobile and tractor batteries that have been in use for over 10 years and still going strong.This 5 amp unit is the best of the bunch.  The one disadvantage to the other units was they were a bit slow in recharging a deeply discharged battery.  This solves that problem.  The only suggestion I have is if you plan on mounting it on a wall.  The package does not come with mounting screws.  You will need to get 2 #6 by 2 1/2 inch screws from your hardware store to complete the mounting process.

I really don't want to give this a negative rating, but usually the sellers tend to pay attention to such negative rating, so that's the reason for 1 star.  I wish I could experience how good this cargo mat is and provide a true review, but I can't.I ordered this item and Won Lane was and still is the only seller that sells this item currently.  Well, I just received an item today and what I got is a Coleman brand cargo mat.  The shipping label said it's shipping OxGord cargo mat, but what I saw inside is definitely a Coleman brand cargo mat.  So the design/pattern is different and size is different from OxGord brand.  From the front to back, OxGord is suppose to be 43-inches long, but this Coleman one is only 36.5-inches long. The shorter width of OxGord is suppose to be 45-inches, but this Coleman one is only 42-inches.  The longer width of OxGord is suppose to be 55-inches long, but this Coleman one is only 53-inches long.  See the attaching pictures for the size and pattern differences.  If I wanted a Coleman, I would have ordered a Coleman.  I saw all these positive reviews and the video about OxGord, and I liked the size, design and pattern so I ordered an OxGord one, but now I don't get to experience the OxGord cargo mat and I am stuck with this Coleman cargo mat which is smaller, has different pattern, has no reviews currently and so I have no idea how good or bad it would be.  I particularly liked how the rear-end side of OxGord has cut-lines that tilts upward slightly from the center and the little circular line at the bottom center which is exactly how my car's trunk is shaped.  But this Coleman one as you can see just has the lines going straight across and won't be as good as OxGord when I have to cut through those lines to make this cargo mat shorter on the sides from the center.Watch out for what you might get!  Fortunately, even if this Coleman brand cargo mat is smaller than OxGord one that I ordered, it's just long-enough to cover from front to back.  But I still don't like it as much as the OxGord one due to the size, design patterns and cut line patterns and etc that I had mentioned above.  If your trunk size is even an inch or two longer than mine and you end up getting this Coleman brand, you will not be able to use it.  Be warned!

Super easy to use. It's a cylinder with markings on 4 "sides". Four sides start with 32,31,30,29 respectively, from there the measurements go down by 4/32's on each marked column. I've included a picture of one of these marked columns.A minor negative would be that the cylinder scratches easily every time you measure something, however none of the markings have scratched off so the paint is resilient.

On my 05 Duramax 67k miles, this was both a simple procedure to do my myself and it improved my injector balance rates by about 50%.  0.0 is a perfect score for an injector, the ecm leans or makes richer each cylinder at idle. as the values grow over time, eventually the injector has to be replaced.  essentially these numbers are prognosticator of the health of your injectors; who know...  Using a BT ODB2 and Torque Pro these are my results:1-8 (before)3.3 0.0 1.2 -3.2 1.3 -3.4 0.5 0.11-8 (After)1.9 -0.9 1.8 -0.8 -0.5 -2.4 -0.4 1.0Everything you need is available from Amazon, except the 8' each of 1/2 and 3/8 fuel line which is readily available from your local parts house.

So to start this out I was not impressed. But it was mainly my fault because I did not do the proper research. But it all good now.I have a 2002 dodge ramAt first install these set off all types of warning lights and messed up my gauges. 3rd gen dodges were not made to have led lights. Which is weird because they are in the gauges. But anyways,  when you want to add led light to your 3rd jen ram you need to get the canbus decoder cancelers.  They will stop your stuff from going all wackey.As you can see in my pictures the difference is light is night and day. You can also see where I mounted the canbus decoders. You want to mount these as they get very hot and can melt stuff. SO DONT MOUNT THEM TO PLASTIC. Do like I did.

Instructions are lacking.  3/16 line slips thru the block no matter how tight you get it.  I got the block so tight, it squished the washer on the top wing nut.  3/16 tube kept slipping thru the block so I kept tightening the wing nuts.  The bottom wing nut pivot bolt sheared off.  First time I used the tools and the block broke on the second flaring of the tube.  Only got one good flare on one end of the tubing before it broke.  Disappointing to say the least.

This a great product, such a simple solution that almost anyone could install DIY.  I have a 2x4 tube frame on my travel trailer welded to my bumper.  I ordered another set because I want to place one on each side of the tube frame.  I plan to carry my 3000 watt generator,that's 150lbs plus a spare tire and tools..  The 4x4 tube bumper welds were never meant to carry that kind of weight.I know I'm probably overdoing it, but that's just me.  Check it out.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7Ys33KTxHgThanksCharlie

This is my second  Dorman reservoir tank for 2004 F350 6.0. For the money it's ok just because it's easy to replace. My first one lasted about 2 1/2 years and  failed. It cracked on the bottom, no idea why. But for the price I guess it's ok. $38.00 ish.Hope this helps you make a  decision.

Beware, the bottle is I got was Transmission Oil, not Motor Oil. See pictures. Obvious mislabel occurred. I have requested a replacement, but not sure I will get what I need unless they cuaght and fixed this since I made my original order a couple days ago.Otherwise the Red Line 20W-50 is excellent, help keep my 103 big twin engine quiet and smooth.I will upgrade my review once I get the oil I ordered.

Vehicle: 2014 Ford Taurus Limited(removal process at end)Before you spray, you want to make sure there's no grease or wax on your lens. I washed mine with soap and water, then used an Ultra Fine-Cut Compound to get any micro-abrasions out. Then, I used a polishing compound on them. Finally, I finished them with alcohol.Shake it a lot before you spray it and once in a while when using it. WARNING: it runs easily and getting any runs, drips or buildup will pretty much ruin your effort. You can always go darker, but you can't go lighter or remove runs, so spray lightly. Start a few inches to the left or right edge of your lens. Press the nozzle out there, clear of the lens, then sweep across. Keep it about 8 inches away and make a nice, consistent pass. The paint should be hitting your lens for about 1 second. I put 3 coats on and it is very dark (see pics).The tint is smooth and glossy as it is, but after it dried (at least 3 hours), I waxed mine for some extra gloss.UPDATE: I had a small blemish on one of my lenses, so I removed the tint and resprayed it. There is good and bad advice everywhere about how to remove this stuff - this is how I did it, safely with no damage.91% isopropyl alcohol took it off easily. Put some on a rag and wipe it off. I used it while the lenses were on the car since the alcohol won't hurt the paint. I still wouldn't recommend letting it sit for a long time on your lens or paint. Wipe off the tint, then wipe off the alcohol. The clear lens picture is after the tint was removed.First, I tried B12 Chemtool (Wal-Mart) to get it off. This stuff took it off super easy, but I was too worried about getting it on the paint. It did not harm the lens, so if you pull your lights out, maybe you could use this. I figured I'd share since I did a lot of research before taking it off.

I installed these a few days ago and finally had some rain yesterday. They worked great, leaving no streaks. They replaced Rain-X brand wipers that cost me a little over twice what these did. The installation diagram on the back left a little bit to be desired but once I figured it out they were easier to install than the Rain-X wiper blade and one less moving part to break!I have uploaded a photo of the latch that will hopefully help others in selecting the correct wiper blade/latch for their 2007 Chevy/GMC pickup.

I was kind of intimidated by it. A locksmith told me that he would rather install 10 ignition locks then 1 ignition switch. It wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be and I have a spider web of wires under my column from a remote start and an alarm. All in all it was fairly simple took about 45 minutes and worked perfect. If you have big hands it may be a tight squeeze but if not everything should go fine.

I attached pictures of the New bottle, including the NEW Front, and the OLD & NEW Rear for comparison. I added this comment, purely to post these images, as there's nowhere else to post them. This is to provide comparison for the people I converse with in the other comments, to show the removal of certifications and approvals. I have a Nissan GT-R and had to stockpile the older formulation as a result Although the 2017 manual still states this is the oil to use, it is clear from the Mobil 1 bottle that this is no longer the case. They had to recommend an oil to use, as there was no other major brand street oil to use. When speaking to Nissan dealerships, they stockpiled the old formulation, and are still using that oil for oil changes, or they'll sell it to us for $16 per quart (or $84 purely for the oil to purchase, if I change the oil myself). The newer formulation is a much thinner oil, and more prone to sheering, essentially converting it to a 0W-30 under heavy use, or over time. It was a light 0W-40 to begin with, but becomes a "heavy" 0W-30.

This is a pretty nice hitch.  I put it on my 1997 Chrysler T&C.  It fit perfectly although the two forward mounting holes needed to be drilled.  My instructions said 20 minutes, which is even more ridiculous than the 30. I spent 20 minutes removing the first rusted bolt.  The second rusted bolt only took 15 minutes to sheer off, plus another 2 hours to drill out the remaining portion very carefully as to not mess up the threads.  Success!  I had other issues like a mouse nest blocking the frame cavity and only haveing 2 fish wires instead of 4 which would have speeded things up quite a bit.  If I had a lift, and a brand new vehicle which didn't need holes drilled 45 minutes might have been possible.It came with barely any packaging other than a few inches of brown paper over the sticker-labels and some plastic tape over the parts kit inside the receiver section.  It was pretty banged up in shipping so I sprayed it with a fresh coat of black paint before I even started to mount it.  I used black bumper paint because it's pretty tough stuff and I wanted to be sure to seal it up from the elements.  I think I put a few new scratches mounting the thing so I'll have to touch it up again tomorrow when it is light out.I'd give it 5 stars if it only came with 4 fishing wires for the bolts instead of just the two.  Not only that, but they are pretty darn short.  You have about an inch to spare on the furthest bolt so you have to be really careful not to let it slip into the hole.  A visegrips on the end keeps it from sliding in but then wants to pull the end out of your hand as you are threading the carriage bolt onto it.  It's a little tricky.I found that putting the furthest front nuts on the carriage bolts first and then pivoting the whole hitch up to meet the next two fasteners nearer the bumper worked although the hitch shifted on me and sort of whacked one of the free-floating carriage bolts without the fish wire and I puckered up pretty good thinking I was going to swat it back into the frame and lose it.  It's pretty damn cheap to only send 4 wires.  It makes doing this job a real tricky proposition with just one person.  I came within a hair's breadth of losing that bolt back into the frame.  So they lose a star for saving a buck and only sending 2 fishwires.Great hitch though. Make sure you paint it and cover any chips and scratches from shipping or the warehouse.  If  you don't It'll rust sure as snap.

It fits great, and looks good, too, but after driving in a few storms now, I can report it's definitely not "water-tight."  I have water coming in at the bulkhead (at the front rail behind the back glass) even after using the included foam strip.  I've ordered an alternative weather seal to try there to see if I can remedy that.  I also had water coming in around the tailgate, but some strategically installed tailgate seal by Extang (available on Amazon) fixed that perfectly.  The part that really gets under my skin is water coming in above the wheel wells under that middle section of the tri-fold (the section with no clamps).  It's not real bad, but I do think I was mislead by other reviewers who claimed their beds were consistently dry.  I'm gonna have to call "BS" on that.I think once I get the front rail seal addressed, I'll be satisfied with the overall weather protection this cover affords, but I admit I'm a little disappointed that it doesn't defend against rain as well as some reviews implied.  I still like it overall, though.

This duck ball hitch cover is very cute. This duck will flap its wings and the target on its belly lights up when you hit the breaks. It plugs in to trailer plug easily and it sits right on the ball hitch. The target light is very bright and can been quite distance. It does sit very loose on the hitch we did have an incident with it hopping off the ball hitch when we hit a bump but we did not lose it. You will need to strap it to the ball hitch to keep it from hoping off when you hit a bump. Other then that it works very well and we like the duck ball hitch cover very much so. The cord itself is covered with a cloth mesh type covering. I would recommend this duck ball hitch cover to all my family and friends and any avid duck lover

Fits like a glove!I bought a 2003 TJ Rubicon with a hardtop, so I was looking for a low price softop for some casual use.After hours checking prices and reviews on many places, decided to give a try on this one.I've got the sailcoth one in black, and today I installed in my jeep using bows, tailgate bar, and surround doors from a seller in craigslist.The top comes with easy to follow instructions, no big deal, and in about an hour everything was ready.Follow the instructions and keep the soft top at least one hour on the sun, the heat helps a lot soften the cloth and make it more flexible and easy to work. Zippers feels strong but it was a little scary to zip on, everything was pretty tight, but after a little practice I found it ok.

Strata is an amazing product. It out-performs the competitive sealants in this space and is very easy to use. Migliore keeps their product quality very high, and the results show.This is a photo of one of my client's cars, after correction and Strata. It looks great months later, as advertised. People cannot believe the depth of the shine. It borders on the depth you see in Modesta (at 10x the cost).Highly recommend! We have made it a staple for our detail clients.Edit - added some additional images (no filters) of a few other vehicles we have done. The repeated results are great. We have a customer who has tracked their car regularly and it held up to that as well.

Some vandals busted out my mirrors on my 2001 Ranger so I went with these to replace them.  I could not be happier.  These came with new hardware, foam seal, and look/fit just like OEM mirrors.  If I had not ordered and installed these myself you would not be able to convince me that these were not OEM.  One thing to note; the pigtail is several inches shorter than the stock pigtail so you have to mount the mirrors before you can plug it in.  Not really a drawback, just something I noted along the way.

Product flipped under my car on the highway. Bracket broke in half and plate was ripped off. Worst part was having to pay for new plates AND I got a ticket in a parking lot for "no front plate" (I live in NY and thats a law) so after a few hundred dollars spent I'm extremely disappointed. It worked well for a few months but regardless this should never happen. Stay away from this product!

I installed this on my 2015 RAM 5.7L HEMI Mossy Oak Outdoorsman. I bought this off CL from a guy for $300. The install was about as easy as any K&N install. Although Getting the delicate air sensor into the thick rubber hose does take some muscle. Just make sure you have the sensor flush and facing the right direction.  Use some wd40 and try to keep the o ring in place.I have only taken it for a test drive and it seems much more responsive and maybe a little more engine noise. We'll see about the MPG. But over all I like it Bc it is Mopar and you would think they would make the best intake for their own vehicles. I had a k&n in my durango and my last ram.

I LOVE this tint. Now this was my first time EVER attempting to install tint, but I am good at putting screen protectors on electronics so I decided to give it a go. The biggest advice I can give is for you to absolutely SOAK your window and the tint before putting it on and have a helper there to assist you. Also make sure that you don't use paper towel, use a lint free cloth when you are cleaning your window. I ended up with some hairs and stuff in my tint, also a couple bubbles. Then I totally screwed up the driver's side window but meh. $30 tint job and it looks pretty decent - especially from far away but with a little practice / if you really take your time it can look like a professional job. I got the 15% tint and it's nice and dark when you look at the car but you can see very clearly out of the windows. See the photos - don't mind my primer, in the process of doing all the body work and painting my car. There is a pic of the before and after for the first window I did :)

Fantastic cover and looks great on a GMC Sierra. Love that its not the glossy vinyl that most are made of. Went on very quickly probably 45 mins tops. I encourage you to YouTube the instruction video and you will not need to look at the directions. Also i is not have to undo the clamps to install they had enough slack to go on and tighten. Also the strap has to go under the back bed rail under the weather strip so as you can cinch it tight when its rolled. I didn't realize that and had to reloosen the two nuts. Highly recommend this tonneau.Update 3/22/18Just had the back strap come off the bar that locks near the tailgate. Looks to be cheaply held by just a hole. This strap looks to keep the bar tight when your rolling it up from the tailgate forwards. (See pic).  Now when I try to roll it up the one side becomes out of align with the other. Somewhat unexpected seeing Ive barely used this thing and only had it for 12 days. Im sure it can be fixed but a nice washer would have not cost much and saved ME the hassle.  Come on Lund!Update 3/23. Fixed it but shouldnt have had to. See pic.

I was originally looking for a plug and play kit for my car.  I have a 2002 Toyota Solara, but couldn't find one so I settled for this set.  Item came on time from Amazon, like always.  The package and contents are of good quality which is what I expected from Hopkins.  I have used them before for my other cars.I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that it didn't come with any wire taps.  Since you will need to tap these wire into your existing wire harness It would have been nice to include it.  But it didn't so I am deducting one star just for the fact that I had to run out to get these.  All you need to do is include 4 of them and would have made this a prefect product out of the box.I have attached pics of what taps I used and also how my install was done on a 02 Toyota Solara.Wire diagrams was easy to figure out with a simple blub tester.For 2002 Toyota SolaraFactory Harness (left side)Green/Red = BrakeGreen/Black = Turn Signal (left side)Green/Yellow - Running lights or Parking lightsWhite/Black = GroundRight SideGreen/yellow = Right Turn SignalIf you follow the wire coordination from hopkins and match them up to my wire diagram you should be able to get this one in less than 5 mins.Of course, be sure to check your car's diagram to determine your wire scheme.  This is specifically for a 02 Toyota Solara.

Only reason Im not giving it the full five is because there is no wiring diagram for it. It does not come with instructions as to which wire is which.I attached a picture of the colors and (for me, 1984 Toyota pick up) what function of the light is what wire. They do work well so far as I just installed. If they break or fail to work, I will write another review on it or modify this one. So if you're reading this and its been a while since I posted this, consider it still working

So, I put this rim tape on my motorcycle and man this stuff is bright. I was a little hesitant at first because when its not reflecting it is sliver and white (more silver than white) but I am glad that I didn't stray away from these. Not only did this rim tape help give my bike a different look but it will make me more visible when riding at night. I'm glad that I didn't go the cheap route. It was pre cut with each side of the wheel using 6 strips which made it too easy to apply. The material and adhesive are great and the product is top of the line. I highly recommend these too any rider and especially those who are debating to get rim tape. The pictures are taken from my camera phone one with no flash and the rest with flash at different parts of the day. I would give this product more stars if I could. I guess my only complaint would be that this is $3 cheaper on ebay for the same product, but doesn't affect the review at all. Just throwing that out there. I will post pictures as soon as I figure it out of it on my white and black CBR 600rr.

I was sent two worthless keys. Somehow they were cut mirrored they way they should be. This is for a 2010 Tacoma. The little long groove is oriented wrong on both keys. Picture it this way,  if you cut the black part of the key off, and inserted it that way, you could.  Luckily I noticed this before having the keys cut.  I will be returning these. Notice in my photo the long narrow groove is opposite of the original factory key.

There is practically nothing to it.~ Nice that it comes with three small rings and you can purchase extra if you have the need for additional organization, but three was fine for me.I have been reconsidering all of the items in my EDC to get things just right.

When one of my Maxima's fog lights went out, I decided to take advantage and switch them both out to match the factory xenon headlights. They match the color temperature pretty well, but one seems a bit more yellow than the other.I bought a xenon kit for the driver's side headlight also, since the housing was changed after a wreck, so if you want to compare color temperature, the passenger side headlight is factory HID, the other three (headlight and fog) are all Innovited

Great replacement fenders for my small utility trailer. Would have given 5 stars except a few whacks with a mallet were necessary to straighten a couple spots where the bends were. No big deal. Fenders were easy to prep and paint. I used spray on undercoating for the underside and stainless steel color paint and a coat of clear to dress them up nice. They were easy to mock up and mount. Gives plenty of clearance for my tires and the option to upsize my tires down the road if I want. Recommended.

These are awesome! I thought I was toast as far as using a weight distribution hitch goes because I couldn't fit the bar over the top side of my trailer's tongue because there is a welded platform in the way supporting the gas tank and the battery for the camper.Install was a little bit tough, It is just hard to drill through both pieces of sheet metal completely level with the ground, I wasn't perfect and it still works just fine so... oh well. Just do you're best.When hitching up to the trailer these do take a little bit more work than if you had the kind that goes over and comes with a leverage bar, you have to hook up the trailer like normal, then raise the tongue quite a bit so you can get the chain over the lip, then lock in place. But when you lower it it won't go back as low as it did before.Bottom line: Don't use this unless you have to, the other method is much less work, but if you have no other choice this bracket is much better than no weight distribution hitch!

This is a very well made item and worth the price. I admit to hating junkey stuuf and my manua/registrationl holder for 1999 Jeep Wrangler had completely worn out. This was an excellent replacement and much better then the OEM that came with it.Bottom line you won't be unhappy with this very well made product.

This track bar is a work of art.  When you pull it out of the box, its shear beauty will amaze you.  Theyve built a beautiful part right here.  Its forged, so its really heavy duty.  The adjustment sleeve works flawlessy.  I installed one on my Jeep, and one on my buddys Jeep.  Put a little anti seize on the adjustment sleeve threads before you install it.  Your alignment tech will thank you.One note that you will find most helpful.......Buy the Rough Country 6610 drop pitman arm to go with it.  I didn't realize it, but after a lot of research on Jeep forums, I learned that the track bar and pitman arm need to be the same height, or your steering will wander all over the road and be very sluggish to respond.  Mine was unsafe at highway speeds.  I bought the RC 6605 pitman arm, and it was still too short.  I called Rough Country, and the guy there wasn't any help.  He said the 6605 should work.  Well, it doesnt.  The bracket that comes with this track bar is built well, and it drops the bar mount 3-4.  Its a nice replacement too, because the Jeep bracket was rusting out.  This bracket is solidly built. I recommend using new flange bolts on the vertical bolts holding upward into the frame.  We have a farm & fleet store here that sells these grade 8 flange bolts by the pound, so you can get new bolts for under 50 cents a piece.  The 6610 drops it the same amount, putting your pitman and track bar back in line.  They should put this in the ad that its what you need.  They tell you you need one, and then don't say what.  6610, 6610, 6610.  Good luck getting the old pitman arm off.  Its a pain.If you break the bolt in the lower axle mount, which you probably will, don't worry.  Take a 4-1/2 angle grinder and cut the bolt thru, getting the old track bar out of your way.  Then, knock the flag nut out.  The new track bar comes with a nut and washer, although youll spend a good thirty minutes trying to get it in there and fit a box wrench in.Hope this helps all of you. Good luck!!

Fast shipping, direct fit for Land Cruiser 1988, some differences with the OEM, the seal of the cap is not replaceable like in the one that came with the vehicle, so is disposable when the seal fails.

Changed out my seat cover and decided to change the cushion, the original was starting to show a little wear.  On the youtube video they recommended changing it because if I didn't, they said a wore out cushion would cause the new cover to wear out faster, it just made sense and since I had every thing removed and disassembled, might as well.  Very pleased with my car seat now.

not using this for the truck it was designed for. putting this on my 1996 gmc suburban 4x4. nobody makes one for my truck so I got this one. looks like its going to be just about perfect.ok here are a few pictures of the install and yes the template is off and yes the front stud is smaller. do not know why. I also did not have a stud in my kit. its the same as the bolts that hold the pillar bracket on. I just got a bolt and cut it down and screwed in from the inside. you will need 3 1/2 hole saw and a tube of silicone. I used black. I trimmed the inner sheet metal with snips. i did need a heat gun for this. I am very happy with my purchaseand would buy again

First thing off i should have read the specs more closely but i get caught up in reading reviews more so than i do the actual product itself and all i see in reviews is(( IT'S WATERPROOF)) which is NOT the case at all, maybe if you have a light shower it will be protected, I've had rain in my area quiet a bit these few weeks of owning  this cover, the water does tend to seep thru to your motorcycle, Another DISLIKE that i see is that the cloth part that protects your windshield is already covering itself in mold and its only been almost 3 weeks since I've had it, the only good thing i like is its snug on the bike but I'm sure A LOT of covers out there are good and snug./// CONS = Not waterproof, Mold, No Protection against hot exhaust///  needless to say i will be looking into another cover that have the things that i need!

Over all, the unit work beautiful, the inverter side supplied the power you need, the charger kick out 105 amp to charge my batteries bank, with the fancy RTR control, you can program the control to sense the SOC of the batteries to switch from inverter to charger automatic by using the AUX function of the RTR control.I end up return this unit back to Amazon to get the 48 volt version, since I have a small AH batteries bank, I hope by doing this the batteries will last longer before I need to add more AH to the battery.The picture show at the rough state of the installation, I have this box install on top of Midnite Solar E-box, feed the AC to the Square D box, the Midnite solar Classic (black box) is solar charge, this unit kick on when the sun come up to charge the batteries.

I purchased both the drivers side and the passenger side part, the drivers side part came with all the parts and after adding some additional grease it worked out great. I'm giving this two stars mostly because of the passenger side part had a pin hole in the gasket that I wouldn't have identified if I didn't add more grease. See picture. The most annoying thing with Moog parts is the use bolts that are a different size from the Honda part they are replacing. If the Honda part required a 14mm wrench, Moog would use a 15mm. When replacing the struts, control arms, and sway bar links, that was a frustrating and unnecessary change.

The helmet overall is a HUGE step up from my prior HJC's (CL-SP + FG-17). However, I was getting a deafening whistle at 75 no matter what I did. I found it to be linked to the top left quadrant of the visor, so I tightened that up, and haven't been back out for a test ride yet, however with it tight enough to pass the "sticker test" per shoei's recommendation, I can't close the visor without using both hands, one pushing on the right side and thumb pulling down on the clip. I definitely expected better overall fit and finish for a near $600 helmet. I never had to make adjustments like this on my HJC's. It's a small annoying detail, just like the unfinished raw molding edge at the top center of the visor that I never expected to see (given the price) I expected a full smooth bezel all the way around, and a proper visor fit at least. The overall materials used are top notch, however, and I love the drop down visor (albeit somewhat more difficult to operate gloved than the IS-17 version). whistling issue could not be fixxed, and pinlock had a surface about as smooth as that of the moon reducing optical clarity to near nothing, i.e. it looked better foggy without pinlock than unfogged with pinlock. Returning this defective piece of junk. Tried going through Shoei and they would do nothing except offer me to ship it to them on my dime to get it "fixed with a template we have for adjusting the visor in house". I'm thinking that should've been done BEFORE it left the factory, not after. I will NEVER spend money on Shoei again. Should've known it was too good to be true, especially given the poor SHARP rating for side impact (where I hit in my old helmet that I went down in). Image attached with moisture showing wear the seal won't form between lower visor and helmet. NO ADJUSTMENTS FIXED THIS, I tried, and a local dealer tried. NADA.

Everything I have written below is my personal opinion based upon many years of repairing/rebuilding/restoring travel trailers.  I use, I have used, and I will continue to use Camco products.  Not this one, tho.I replace a LOT of vinyl insert trim.  I needed a roll ASAP to finish a camper (my 1000' spool ran out) so I added a 25' roll of Camco 25202 to a quick Amazon order because I DID NOT THINK IT THROUGH.  Big mistake.There is a difference in vinyl insert trim.  This Camco product is inexpensive but it is not worth the hassle.  Camco 25202 is rock hard, slightly off white, and relatively inflexible across the width.  The profile is also wrong for almost every roof edge molding.  It isn't worth the struggle and sore fingers fighting this into the roof edge molding, and when you (eventually) get it installed there is an even chance that the screw heads this product is designed to cover will be visible (as bumps) through the insert trim, especially hex screws.  Camco 25202 cracks easily in cold weather and yellows quickly in areas of the country with stronger sunlight (south Texas, for example).  I have replaced Camco insert trim on campers out of south Texas that had yellowed so badly the insert trim looked burnt.I prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/JR-Products-10121-White-100-foot-Premium-Vinyl-Insert/dp/B0031Y7Z1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">JR Products 10121 White 100 foot Premium Vinyl Insert</a>.  The JR Products 10121 installs easily, covers pan head and hex screws without showing bumps, is brilliant white in side by side comparison with the Camco product (which has a slightly tannish hue), and according to my micrometer is almost twice as thick as the Camco product.  I can "zip" the JR Products inset trim into the roof edge molding with my thumb as fast as I can move it along the molding rather than fighting the Camco trim every inch of the way.If I prefer the JP Products and dislike the Camco product why did I buy the Camco product?  Because I got in a hurry, did not want to make the 90-mile round trip downtown to my distributor, and honestly, it has been so many years since I have used anything other than the JR Products trim I forgot what an incredible hassle the Camco product was.

I did buy this through someone else, fit was a bit tough and the sensor replacement was a bit of challenge to put in new tube but it was worth it, blue on blue match to car and the 5.7 2007 with flowmaster 40 exhaust now screams on throttle and auto-sticking down is a wonderful thunder, I left the resonators on with exhaust just b/c of being a bit mature :)Oh, def clean throttle bottle, take off simple 4 bolts, rag and carb cleaned is what I used and for sure enhances the sound, tourque mightily...oh, and no engine lights to worry about so getting inspection sticker shd be no problem in mass unless they go under the hood and know that model does not get passed legally in 300c in calif or mass....there is no certificate from the mfg on this for 300c....beware thats why its probbaly cheaper, who knows...i like! Ps the clamps suck the welds break get screw clamps while ordering and avoid headaches....gluck!

If you are on the fence, buy it.  I was reluctant to make the purchase because frankly, the pictures just don't do this frame justice.  It is a gloss black metal frame that is laser engraved, allowing the Mustang Horse and wording to pop.  The whole frame is clear coated, giving the engraved wording and logo to have a pearl essence look.  It does not have hooks to hold the plate and it does not have rubber grommets to prevent scratching.  I installed small circular stick on furniture pads to prevent noise from rattling (Roush Exhaust) and from scratching the paint.  Anyway, you will not be disappointed and this frame will pay appropriate homage to the beloved 50 year anniversary Ford Mustang (see pics).  I put this frame on my 2015 White GT and it looks stunning.

Great accessory. All the 12V outlets you'd likely needs in one neat waterproof, switch-controlled package. The narrow handlebar clamp means you don't waste a lot of handlebar "real estate" mounting this. Installation is simple and it comes with 2 fuses, one of which is a spare. Nice waterproof in-line fuse holder.

Arrived pretty quickly.  Good quality.  Lights look great.  Had a problem after installing where the green lights wouldnt work.  Contacted them and they diagnosed the problem and sent a replacement part with no hassle.  Replacement fixed the problem.  I have them installed on my RZR1k and mounted the box under the seat.  Ran a dune trip and did some trail riding with no green and they were fine.  Very bright.The QR code on the box attempted to give my phone AIDS, so I downloaded the app in their picture from the play store.  BLEDIM is the app.5 stars for quality.  4 stars for having to make a return and for the QR code being bogus.

very good quality trunk, especially for the price. sturdy construction and good look.  the outside pockets have zippers for function but nice looking leather flaps to keep it looking old school. same with the fake buckles that hide quick release latches. inside pockets are useful for keeping small things from rolling around, and the main compartment is big enough to fit my medium hjc full face helmet with a little effort. the mounting system is very adaptable and mounts easily and quickly to the backrest on either a luggage rack or the passenger seat.

At 1st I wasn't sure if I would feel a difference by just buying rotor but I bought any ways. I need better brake on my avalanche because the stock ones didn't stop every well. After install these along with some mgp caliper cover ,they look great and i did feel some improvement on the brakes. Also it is much quiet than stock after the break in procedure. Also they don't rust!  It not like stoptech, or wilwood but it does improve the brakes. Happy with these rotor and May buy their caliper to see if improve even more

This grill guard is the real deal, very heavy duty.  I just installed it, so I can't comment on the durability yet, but think this grille guard will handle anything I can throw at it.  Before installing I read reviews on Amazon, watched Youtube videos, and downloaded the installation manual.  I can confirm that the included install manual is useless.  I highly recommend watching an install video from "Justin" on youtube.  I didn't consult the directions once, his install video is that good.  I had some issues getting the guard level to the truck, just make sure you keep all of the bolts loose until you get it where you want it.

In my previous job, I used to detail cars. Now I do it as a hobby as I thoroughly enjoy keepig my vehicles clean. I currently work and live in one of the most harshest environments in the world, im UAE our summers here see 125 degrees F, or 52 c. That being said the sun is BRUTAL on paint here! I purchased this wax locally (although looking on amazon to order for my parents in the US) And can say that it made a huge difference in both my silver gti and my blue bora (jetta)As with every vehicle, a thorough clean and clay bar is advised before waxing to ensure all contamination is removed.The blue cars roof was oxodized so bad before this picture I was sure the paint was fried. After 3 coats with this wax, well you can see the results for yourself.The wax goes on very easy, and I followed directions exactly. Do not let it dry into a hard haze.This wax also wipes of very easy and best of all leaves behind zero streaks!

I mounted this light on my 1986 Suzuki 230 Quadsport (4-wheeled off road motorcycle).  The bike does not have a battery so all of the lights run off of the motor's stater.  The stater on this quad only puts out a maximum of 55 watts so I needed a new headlight that I could run in addition to my 5 watt taillight and my 5 watt whip light.  This light looks great on the bike and performs as good as I had hoped it would.  The light does have a little bit of a strobe-light effect when the bike is at a dead idle but that is not a problem for me.

Using the Fiesta ST as a daily driver, I looked around for ways to be able to carry my mountain bike. I tried the roof racks, but got tired of having to lift the bike to the roof.With this hitch I can now use my new Saris Freedom Super Clamp 2, and bike loading and unloading is easy.Install was a bit tricky alone. Hardest part was fishing the bolts and plates into position. I still have the stock exhaust, so a Cobb exhaust hanger kit was used to make sure that the muffler would not bang against the hitch.Not planning on ever towing anything with it, just my bike rack.

2007 Acura TL Type S 3.5LThe original oil plug in this car doesnt have a magnet on the end of it.  This oil plug is a no brainer for added protection.  I just changed my oil today, the day of this review, so I will follow up after I change my oil in 3,500 miles.  The quality of this thing is insane, its like a piece of art.  The magnet is insanely strong which should grab a lot of the metallic particles in the oil.  The picture is me holding the oil plug with a leather attached to It, it even held my 3/8 drive ratchet up by the magnet.  If your car doesnt already have a magnetic oil plug, I highly recommend this.  The pictures don't do this justice.

As far as I can tell these are exactly the same as all the other deflators of this style including the arb.  Most likely the same factory in china cranking them out under different brands.  This has worked flawlessly for us and at half the price you can't go wrong.  It deflates very quickly if you are sure to completely back out the valve stem.  Many of the bad reviews sound like some other problem was occurring.  You can see me using this and get a little tutorial by searching for Brady Adventures EZ Deflator on youtube.  Thanks  Oh by the way the case this one comes in is trash.

This thing is sweet! It's solid as can be. My generator tube was small so the smallest shim needed tightened at first to clamp on to it. If you do this, you'll need a deep well socketDuring tightening, i snapped the "u" shapped exhaust bolt. I went down to Auto Zone and picked another up for $2. So watch out for that if you tighten it too hard.I still have no idea what these 4 pin looking things do? I am going to upload a picture of them. They are not listed in the instruction video.I feel like 4 screws should have been included. If anyone figures this out, let me know!All these issues aside, it still gets 4 stars for working as designed. This thing does the job and no fumes are below the vehicle which is what I was going for. Seems sturdy and easily removable when I need it.Just let me know how to these these pin things? Someone said it was a screw, but it has no threads.Oh yeah one last thing. The transport bag was missing the flipper to the zipper. I tied a piece of string around it so I can actually use it.

This vinyl was fantastic! I used it to wrap the fog lights on my 97 Subaru. Super easy to apply. Had both fogs finished up within 10 minutes. Easily covered 2 fog lights with tons left to spare.to install, I just stretched it across the sense without using the head gun. Because it's thicker, you can easily stretch it to get it to form onto curves and get rid of wrinkles. Once it was stretched, I used the head gun to seal up the edges and get them to bind to the outer edge of the lense.Great Product! I'll definitely buy again!

UPDATE: 4/1/2016 - I've used this epoxy on several more things and it's holding power is impressive. I repaired a ceramic trinket bowl that had a "leaf" flourish with a curly stem that broke away from the bowl. I also repaired a belt that had a glass "crystal" fall out of its setting.---This is a review of Permatex 84145 Black Plastic Weld Epoxy.I picked up at package of this at Autozone. I had a black plastic frame around my drivers side outside mirror that had cracked and was flopping around. I bought this epoxy to see if it would hold the plastic to the glass mirror after another epoxy product failed. This worked well and after a week of going through the car wash a couple times, cold weather and rain, it is continued to hold so far.I could have been a little more careful in applying it but overall I'm happy. I like that this sets quickly although because of that, you can't dillydally . You've got about 5 minutes to apply this once the two parts have been mixed.The only negative is that the plunger did not operate very smoothly. It gave me too much of one part and not enough of the other. I had to wiggle and fidget with it a bit to get the equal amounts needed. I docked a star because of that. But the epoxy was great and solved a problem for me.

I bought these goggles several months before they were to be used for the first time. During that first use (a week-long camping trip) both pairs broke. Specifically, the slot where the strap attaches to the frame snapped in such a way that there was no way for the strap to stay attached. Since I had bought them quite awhile before we used them the first time, it was too late to exchange them when we returned from our camping trip.

In my opinion:Received in a timely fashion; the 6 scrapers ordered arrived packed loose in a padded 'jiffy' style shipping bag.Scrapers are far too small to be of practical automotive use, measuring about 8 5/8" (219mm) long, with 2 13/16" (71.4mm) wide blades. Blades material is thin as well, 0.020" (0.508mm). See attached photo and note that I consider myself to have medium size hands.Disappointed to say the least, why such tiny scrapers are even made is beyond me.Returning...***UPDATE, 12/16/2016To add insult to injury, yet another bitter disappointment; these items do not come with free return shipping! It cost me $10.12 and about an hour of time & aggravation to send them back... and I'm still in need of scrapers.

Update: 9/5/2017I have done another successful oil change.I drove around a block to warm up my engine (to 60 -70 degrees) that was sitting in my garage overnight.Extracted all old oil and filled 6 quarts of new oil.Original: This makes DIY oil change an easy task.The unit is built very solid.When assembling the hose parts, heat up the ends of the clear hose with a hair dryer for about 30 seconds or until the ends are soft.  This will make easier to insert the pieces together.As some other reviewers have done, consider getting a ball valve.  I bought a 3/8 ball value(see pic) from Lowes.  It fits perfectly and is easier to use than the plastic clamp.Use the oil dip stick to measure the length of the hose that needs to reach the bottom of the oil pan. I just used painter's tape to mark the length. But ended up inserting about 2 more inches to get to the bottom.It took about 15 minutes to get 6qts of oil from a warm engine.  It makes gurgling sound when all the oil is sucked out.I am very happy I got this with extra upgrade. I can't wait until the next oil change.

Worth it (so long as you're not buying it for the "sound" feature!)I've seen a hundred LED and Neon under dash or interior lighting kits in the last few years. I was hesitant to purchase this and was, instead, half way through creating my own with a little technical know-how...BUT, the reviews and photos painted a very solid picture. I'm happy to say this product exceeds what I expected!PROS -Easy, universal installation (if you don't know that red its positive and black is negative then you shouldn't attempt to jump the battery in your car, let alone hook anything electrical up!). Rather than run it straight of the battery I have installed it using a 12V cigarette lighter plug (as I have easily a dozen outlets in my vehicle for such devices). After installing a blue LED light to my universal 12V plug it makes a very nice additionBright, consistent light and fun "flashing/chasing/fading" features (actually quite an excellent audio installation addition!)CONS -I'd hardly call this a "con" but since it's a fact I shall state it - The music/sound feature that is intended to "pulse" with the music is sub-par. It will, in fact, blink with vibration (not sound!) and when the music is off it will continually blink every couple of seconds. However, if you want a LED kit to go with your music it would be much simpler to run a lead off of your speak, amp, or head unit to get consistent, reliable "music" lighting

It works great, but I was pretty bummed that they do not look like they do in the picture. I love he Chevy keys because they have the long slot for the key ring and the ones delivered have a tiny little speck of a hole. Hard as heck to get it on the ring. So it's pretty hard to mess up something as simple as a blank key, and this sender did it.

Arrived in good shape from Amazon so was happy about that. I only have done initial set up and so far, the quality of the genset seems excellent. Some small complaints I do have is that I'm disappointed in Yamaha out sourcing to China, I've heard Honda did the same but haven't verified this. If Honda is still made in Japan I'd of gone that way in retrospect.  Though I really like the fuel shut off and gauge on the Yamaha. That is what sold me. The cast iron cylinder and metal valve train is also nice. I added the Motocross Hardline hour meter and the magnetic oil pick up.  Initial oil fill was exactly 400ml of 0W-30 Royal Purple Break in Oil. I'll switch to Castrol 0W-40 synthetic European SN rated oil (German made) after 20 hour break in. I'll also break in with ethanol free fuel (Trufuel, Husqavarna, VPT4 etc etc).

The idea behind this production is laudable BUT the manufacturer only taught of how to get money but never considered the respective customers. The materials used to manufacture this product are below standard and the item itself is too small to fit my battery terminal post. I received the products broken immediately I removed them from the box.

I recently bought this for my teenage son, when he got his first car.  I knew that he would want to have it looking its best, and I figured that the ease of using this (waterless, etc.) would make it easier for him to actually..you know.. do it. ;-)I recently asked him how it was (thinking to myself that I wondered if he'd even bothered to do it yet)...and to my surprise (and delight!) he *raved* about it!  And then, the next time that I saw his car, sure enough!.. his car is looking great!Now, let me add that this is a 12-year-old car, but the previous owner had kept it in really nice shape.  Well, with this product, the finish on his car looks almost like new!  It's awesome!! (Check out the picture!)

Very well build and engineered product. This is by-far the easiest intake I have put on. Took about an hour because I am meticulous and I bet I could do it in a half hour now that I've done it once.The stock air assembly is heavy, over-engineered, and inefficient, to say the least. This thing is just what it needs to be. A box that filters and sux air.Turbo noise louder but not obnoxious.4 stars because the filter came a little disfigured. You can see what I meanin one of the pictures.Can't really tell if there is any substantial HP gain yet, or GPM but time will tell and I'll update as information comes in.See pictures for old vs. this S&B box

Worth every  $$$. If I had known what a difference these made in appearance,  I would have bought them long ago.  Hid the rust repair and gave truck a finished look and whole new personality. Installation was not easy, as some original hardware was stripped and clips didn't always fit, but self-tapping screws (included) solved that. Huge improvement for "small" investment.

This stuff is amazing. I have a brand new Malbec Black Infiniti that a bird wasted no time marring the finish with what could only have been a radioactive crap in the middle of the hood. I tried another product and only succeeded in adding swirl marks. So after doing some research, I bought this product. Two passes and both the clear coat etching and swirl marks were gone...I couldn't believe it. Super easy to use and it worked. I'll never use anything else.

This cover does what it suppose to do. Definitely a cheap fix compared to oem. Not the best either depending on your application. I replaced mine inside the tailgate so wasn't to worried about the look, more concerned about functionality. First off looks real close to oem, it has rougher edges though. Second thing I do see is that it doesn't sit flush. Didn't matter to me again because it will be inside my tailgate. Outside it would be a problem. I probably would not buy this for outside replacement. Outside use OEM if your truck is nice looking.

Used this to install a double DIN Pioneer stereo into the dash of a '98 F150. For anyone trying this on a '97-04 f150, be aware that you'll need to cut lots of stuff behind the radio (plastic and metal). I used a Sawzall and it was very messy and not for the faint of heart. Definitely not a novice DIYer project. In the end, it looked factory and held the radio tightly into the dash

I guess I should have done a better job of looking through the reviews. After I received it I was let down to know that the kit that attaches it to the truck costs another $85. So this is just the rack itself. Why they couldn't sell it in one kit is stupid to me.When I spoke with customer service they said they would sell me the missing parts for $100. Which is funny because they are for sale by other distributors for much cheaperAfter getting over how pissed off this all made me I'm happy to say I really like the way it looks and I get a lot of extra looks cause of it.

Bought some red for a rehab project on a Youth Football Team cargo trailer.  Incredible performance and super easy to use.  We dipped the wheels in red. We started with a coat of red on the white wheel, but it appeared more pink so we opted for a base coat of black, then three solid coats of red, a single coat of metalizer, and then two coats of glossifier.  An old deck of cards worked perfect for masking.The coating is smooth, has a little metallic zing to it and looks amazing!  Not a bad transformation for $15 worth of materials!

Update, January 2017;I've since discovered and purchased the BatteryMinder 128CEC1, and it is close to my ideal smart charger, as it combines a full-time desulfation with multiple voltage profiles for gel, flooded, and high-performance AGM specific batteries, almost combining all of the functionality of the Ctek and XtremeCharge.  The one thing it misses is the recondition charge function of the Ctek.  It does add an 8 amp charge capability and temperature compensation.  It will also attempt to recover batteries from low voltages that would usually require a "dumb" charger to start with a Ctek or Xtreme Charge.  If I were to only have one charger, the 128CEC1 would be my choice.  It does come at a price though, as you could almost buy a Ctek and an Xtreme Charge for the same price.  You'd be missing the temperature compensation though, which I feel is important if you are charging batteries in less than ideal temperature conditions..Original review;I have an old Schumacher battery maintainer, a Yuasa SmartStart 1.5, a Pulsetech Xtreme, and the CTEK MUS 4.3.The Schumacher is just a maintainer/charger.  It has no desulphate mode, but works well to keep the battery topped up.The Yuasa does the same thing, but adds a mediocre desulphate mode.  In testing, I found that it did bring batteries to a higher state of charge then the Schumacher.The Xtreme Charge is a powerful tool for desulphating batteries, but it does not do as well as the MUS 4.3 at fully charging a good battery.The MUS 4.3 has a desulphate mode, but I've never seen it enter that mode, even on a badly abused battery.I'm currently in the process of attempting to restore a 12V 22 Anp-hour 5 year old AGM battery that was deeply discharged, to under 6v.  The Schumacher, Yuasa, and Xtreme all refused to even start on this battery.  I had given up on it, and was about to order a replacement, when I decided to try out the MUS 4.3.When I plugged in the MUS 4.3, it attempted to charge the battery, but then found the battery bad after it dropped to under 12v in 3 minutes, after it attempted to charge the battery.  I feel that afew attempts to recharge the battery would probably have done the trick, but it was bed-time, so I figured I'd go back to ol-reliable Xtreme Charge.I then hooked up the Xtreme Charge, and it began to charge the battery.  After letting it sit overnight on the battery, the battery was able to hold over 12V.  I decided to leave it on the Xtreme charge another 12 hours, and will attempt a recondition with the CTEK.I will update later on my progress, but my conclusion so far, is that the CTEK offers features the Xtreme Charge does not have, while the Xtreme Charge offers features the CTEK does not have.  Both are top of class chargers.  I wish I could somehow combine them into one.  If the CTEK would always desulphate, like the Xtreme charge does, I'd pick it over the Xtreme.  As is, I'd lean more toward the Xtreme.  For cases where it does not want to start charging to to low voltage, one can use a $10 trickle charger to bring the battery up over 11 volts.  My trickle charger died though, and I have yet to replace it.Update:After leaving the battery that the CTEK said was bad, on the XTreme charge for a week, it now is working well.  The Xtreme Charge would not charge the battery before I tried the CTEK on it though.At this point, if I had to have one battery maintainer, I'd stick with an Xtreme Charge and get a $10 trickle charger for truly dead batteries, to get them up to where the Xtreme Charge will charge them.That said, I'm happy to have the CTEK, in addition to the Xtreme Charge as the different modes the CTEK has can come in handy.Update 2:I have a car with a year old battery that stopped accepting a charge.  This car sits a lot, but is kept on one of my battery maintainers when it is sitting for long periods.After several months of driving it every day, it stopped accepting a full charge.  It got to the point where I was keeping it on the Xtreme charge at night, but it still would barely start the car at the end of the day.  I checked the alternator and it was fine.  I was almost ready to buy a new battery when I decided to give the CTEK a try.I set the CTEK to recondition mode, and it spent several hours charging the battery.  The next morning, the engine fired up with gusto.  That evening, after sitting at work all day, it fired up with gusto again, and the next morning and evening as well.The CTEK just paid for itself once more.  At this point, I feel like both chargers, the CTEK, and the Xtreme, definitely have there own niches.  I am glad I have both.Update 3;I wound up leaving the lights on for my Suzuki Samurai, which has a 4 year old battery.  I did not drive it for two months, so the battery was stone dead for that time.Neither the XtremeCharge nor the CTEK will charge a completely dead battery, so I hit it with my old Schumacher first.  The Schumacher instantly showed the battery fully charged, indicating that the battery had no capacity.After that, I tried the Xtreme Charge, but it said the battery was bad. I put the CTEK on the battery in recondition mode, and left it on for 12 hours.  After that, the battery started the Samurai, but very slowly, indicating the battery still did not have much cranking capacity.Next I put it on the Xtreme Charge for 12 hours, and it never went above 75% charge, but the the engine fired up like new again.I did one more recondition with the CTEK, but have not had time to do another application with the Xtreme Charge so I don't know if it will take a 100% charge.  I will update when I do get a chance, but I am very happy as of now since I did not have to buy a new battery.

EDIT 2:6 months later. I have to revise my review to 4 stars.I had my last set for about 4 months and they worked great but suddenly stopped working on one side. I basically ordered a new pair since as stated before, they match perfect my HID in color. The new pair worked for about 2 days.Turns out that the connector on my car was damaged and the pins shifted because of the vibration when driving. Got the connector replaced but still had issues.I discovered that the pins on the bulb (H11) actually don't really hit the connectors contact by default or just very slightly. I had to bend the bulb pins inwards to get a solid contact. Viola no issues on the bulb. Also tested the "old" pair and again no issues after the small mod.So still not a 5 star product but almost there :-) Looks like these bulbs are actual reliable. I will keep this updated.EDIT: I revised the rating here since Amazon was nice enough to send me a replacement, however it took a negative feedback to get a hold of Boltlink - however it was Amazon that resolved the case not Boltlink.I am giving 5 stars to the product itself but 2 stars to customer service until I get a better experience.ORIGINAL:.. they burn out and there is no way of claiming the 2 years warranty.I tried to track down Boltlink - on their Facebook, on their website (e-mail is broken), direct e-mail (is returned) and even called their Chinese phone number (disconnected number).I hate that Boltlink is not standing up to their promises because I really like the light pattern and color. It perfectly matches my HID's. But I can't afford paying $30 every 2 months.

I bought this can awhile back but used it for the first time this past week. At the time I ran out of gas, it was dark and cold in the mountains so didn't see the vapor cap was still in place. When I pushed the nozzle in against the tank lip, the vapor cap prevented the black insert from retracting and eventually broke from my efforts to pour gas in the tank.This seems a poor design; even if I had remembered to remove the vapor cap, it would have easily become lost in the dark. It should be a bright color and have a lanyard or something. Anyway, I now have a useless piece of equipment unless I can get a replacement nozzle assembly, which the seller does not sell separately from the can.

Got this for my van setup. It's being powered by two group 34 AGM deep cycle batteries. I tested it in the house using a vacuum and hair dryer. Worked great even with the hair dryer using 1700+ watts constantly. The only thing I notice so far is that even when the unit isn't powering anything the cooling fan cycles about every five minutes. I'll follow up with another review after I use it in the field.

Most of us are familiar with the boot idea used by impounders and municipalities to prevent the removal of offending vehicles and this&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Ancheer-High-Quality-Steel-Heavy-duty-Car-Tire-Wheel-Anti-Theft-Clamp-Lock/dp/B019RO20IO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Ancheer High Quality Steel Heavy-duty Car Tire Wheel Anti Theft Clamp Lock</a>&nbsp;moves that idea to personal security and an affordable level.While this is not quite as perfect as the boots used by such impounders (as this unit will not cover the lugnuts to prevent removal of the tire), it is a great deterrent to even most determined car thieves, and also its a quick solution with low to no learning curve, meaning less time securing and more time getting on my way after parking.  This means even if they get the tire off, they still have to take more time to put another on (like they grow on trees, right), way too much effort, just move on, excellent deterrent.The clamp is easy to use, and just simple enough to pinch around the tire, lock it, and be done.  The lock is a simple 'deadbolt' on the inside and while the key may be just a tad tricky to get it it in, it's really no hassle at all after used it a couple times.  The clamp is adjustable to most all types of tire and rim thickenesses making it ultra-versatile.  I love that the lock has a cap to keep it weather resistant protecting the locking terminal from elements of nature.A smart thought on this is the rubberized handle for easy holding and the pinchers to help protect rims from any scratching, very smart.[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]

Tried this for the first time last week. I always try new products on my old expedition before use on my newer vehicles. Haven't waxed the expedition in months. I sprayed a little of this on a quarter panel and wiped with a microfiber towel. That qtr panel is still slick and feels freshly waxed. I then used on my entire car for a car show. I love it's quick drying and shining properties. Will definitely keep this in my arsenal for quick wipe downs. It's also great as a lubricant during drying.

These are great. Installed on my 2004 Xterra. Make sure to run a bead of clear silicone around the lens to prevent moisture from getting in when driving. Very bright. Brighter than my headlights. Uses way less energy than the 200w halogen setup I replaced. Works great with wiring harness found on amazon. Get the 2 lead model if you want to wire these as one circuit and not have to add any wiring.

The Velcro fastener wobbles too much for my taste on my 2003 XLH1200 Sportster. I feel like it is going to fall lose, and I don't plan to try to catch it when it falls off at 80 MPH.I will probably replace the hook-and-loop connection with some industrial double-sided sticky tape that I have out in my shop.The clock looks like it belongs there on the front fork top bolt cover (pictured).

These are very thick and strong and keep the dirt and water off my carpet and in the mats.  The Zone Tech 3 Piece Gray Premium Quality floor mats are working out great.  They are made with rubber material that is thick and the grooves are deep enough to hold all the dirt that I track from my dirt driveway and water from rain, mud and snow, they are really heavy duty and will hold up to a whole lot of dirt and grim.They fit nicely in the front of the car and the back mat covers both sides and over the middle hump, so it protects the entire back area and not just the two sides.  The gray matches my gray carpet and keeps them from sticky out like a sore thumb.  These mats are good quality and have really made a big difference for me in my car.  I no longer have to worry overtime it rains or snows about getting water and mud in my carpet, and with the rubber mats I can just vacuum the dirt out of the mats and if they get really dirty I can just take them out and wash them and put them back in.  My carpet is thanking me.  The carpet in my car was getting so ruined and packed with dirt and these are saving the day and my carpet.Disclaimer:  I did receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review of the product.

I am giving this 4 stars just because I had to call Amazon and get a new one because the original one I ordered leaked a lot since it was missing an O-ring. Amazon was great at sending a new replacement for same day delivery and I can say that it works perfectly!

Great wax. Have not used many others so hard to compare to it some cheaper ones but this one has lasted very long. It is not a paste, it is a big block that sort of feels like a candle. Used it to wax my car windshield and headlights and it works great even though the package says not recommended for glass. Has been over 2 months and it still creates water beading better than rain-x. It is important to prep whatever you are going to wax properly before hand to make sure the wax gets a good coat. I cleaned the windshield really well and used a clay bar on it then waxed with a regular microfiber cloth and am having excellent results.I also used it on a piece of wood furniture and it made it look nice and glossy.

YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME !!!!!! The one terminal clip looked great but the second terminal was about as sturdy and thick as 3 plys of tin foil. I will have to go to store and purchase and install a sufficient clip.The first picture is the regular clip the second picture is the tin foil clip and the 3rd is of both clips together.

For the money this box is excellent. Locking mechanism is awkward and I can't just leave the key in it like my older Givi model could. It wobbles a bit on universal mount but I fixed that mostly with rubber washers from hardware store. Other than those things it was a good purchase considering it was only 80 bucks!

Wow!! Such a cost-effective addition that is super helpful. Why this does not come as an option is crazy. Install took 25 minutes because I took my time. Install was straight forward and the provided instructions are very easy to follow. Highly recommended this product. Installed on a 2018 Ram 1500 Sport Regular Cab

Had rear fender rust and didn't want to weld.....review cons:I totally thought the rivet bolts fastened to side panels.Worried the clips wouldn't secure flares enough that highway speeds would rip them off.Supplied torx tool doesn't fit in...heck any tool I have except a 8mm socket.Would have been nice to have new front factory screws apart of kit as old ones are worn and rusted.Literally that's it for cons. Now the pros:Went to local paint store and purchased, adhesion promoter, factory paint, poly primer. Cleaning of fenders is a MUST prior to painting!Gave extra screws and nuts in case mistake is made.Flares fit snug and tight to truck. Don't flap or even MOVE on highway, very secure indeed!Installation was easy and instructions were even easier to follow. Took 2 hours for installation.Gave an excuse to tell my wife I needed a Rough Country 2.5inch level kit, and a set of Hellwig helper springs.Cheaper than Bushwackers.FAST SHIPPING!Will update in 3 months after numerous off road and camping trips.

Bright light.  Somewhat of a spot light but not good as driving light. even pointed down they blind the oncoming drivers because they're not focused enough. Lots of light leak.  Also, quality is not the best. In pictures you can see the lights are not properly aligned in the lenses. One was fine but the other was off.  Didn't change the flood/spot issue though.  Better used as off-road.

The is a great "rattle can" paint product and it is very easy to use. It works more like a primer that a paint in that it is an easy application and more forgiving than you might think when you get a little heavy handed. I cleaned, prepped and painted the transmission pan off my truck and let it sit overnight before installing it back on the truck. It looks great and gives me a nice dark purple to offset the black. I used this for two reasons, the transmission gets pretty hot, enough that I'm not sure regular paint would last but I also have the exhaust pipe crossover that goes directly beneath the transmission pan. After I put this back in place and refilled the transmission, I also drove the truck around for about 10 miles and there was no discoloration. That may happen over time but my route ot work is only about 2 miles so it may take some time for me to burn it. I plan to use this to paint the front and rear differentials as well as the engine oil pan as those services come up. I highly recommend this product.Update - 22 JUN 14: No big change but having a different vehicle now and not able to find a decent rattle can purple standard paint, I went back to this engine paint. I used it on the aluminum CAI tube and the plastic engine cover and fuse box lid and it turned out great. I'll add some photos to the product link. A really great product.

First photo is with a led surefire flashlight shining at me and the second is me driving away and a tiny street light making me glow! Update now since rain was experienced on(9/26/16)- first real rain I was complete dry and comfortable. I'm adding a photo now! Awesome product and protection for the price. This is my first legit rain gear for my motorcycle and I'm happy with it. My last gear was simply rain pants that eventually ripped when I scraped them on a bunk of lumber when I got to work and they always rode up on my pants while riding so that was never fun to deal with. My previous upper body "rain gear" was simply a thin, small wind and rain throw over with sleeves and my riding jacket that only the inner liner is water proof so when I got to work my riding jacket would be soaked and I would be pretty mad I had to dry it before I left for home. So this product I bought I recieved really fast and I used it the very next day, "today, 9/23/2016".It worked really well, I really only needed the pants and my boat covers becuase of the highway still being wet and spraying my bike and legs but the entire time I felt completely dry and comfortable. It was an added benefit that from all sides cars could see me becuase of the bright greenish-yellow upper body. On the highway someone was attempting to merge into my lane and normally they would just continue but this driver immediately saw me and kind of served back into their lane. That was nice not being cut off because of the high viz jacket!! I would definitely buy this again. Little info on me, the size I bought, and why I choose that size.So, I am roughly 144 pounds, 5'10" and a pretty slim skinny build type of guy. (Also in 22 years old)I went with the large option because I was tired of my pants riding up in the rain so that added length is nice to have (plus the stirrups that go under your foot is awesome!) if your pants are to big just pull them up as high as possibile and roll the top where the stretchy thing is downward and that makes the pants shorter in length and still weather proof. The added material helps me able to fully put on my riding jacket and it be completely dry after a rain ride.Overall the product is built strong with great material. I would purchase again. I hope my review helps people out.

I am very happy with the for of these mats.  Exact match and far better than the factory rubber mats.  I wish they came up a little higher than they do on the edges, but they should hold up well.  Look nice in my crosstrek  (2014).  They do not have deep groves like the Rugged Ridge set I have in my jeep, which is better for cleaning but worse for catching snow. Overall I recommend these mats, they are far superior to the factory mats.  (I have added footwell lighting in my car, that's why you can see them so well)EDIT 5/10/2017:  ODOR.  I have changed a few things on my XV, including a Borla muffler.  I used some pretty smelly sealant as a little extra security against leaks, and I thought the smell was from that.  Since a month has now passed, that is not the smell.  When I have the heat on just the lower foot setting, where you will generally have the heat, I notice a really strong odor from these mats.  I can change it to the higher vents and it goes away, and there is no smell from the vents so it is not my exhaust sealer (yes I put the air on recirculate and no change).EDIT 6/3/2017:  It is now regularly hot outside and the smell is horrible.  I now regret purchasing these, it has only gotten worse.  I took them out.

Bought 4 of these. Just about bought another brand but as I use this brand on all replacements for my rv etc. I thought I'd stick with them. Really glad I did. I used these to replace my fogs on my f-350. These guys are very solid well made light. Oh and yea very bright for their size. I camp alot and when returning to campground I turn off my main lights as to not light up the interior of everyone elses camper / tent. These will be great but will have to be aimed down. They are very bright as I mentioned b4. I intend to put one on the back of my truck wired to the backups. And one on the back of the camper wired the same.

They work amazing, strong and durable through many drops, survived me getting hit by a car, saved my levers many times, not for wind resistance. Only issue is they bend easy at the tip so if you drop it hard you might have to straighten it back up and then just tighten it back down, not a huge deal. But I love them.

Even though Amazon says these shout fit the 1st Gen Ford Expedition, They DO NOT fit without modifying the light fixtures.. as they are wider than the standard glass festoon bulb. I had to PERMANENTLY modify every single overhead light housing for these to fit, though these put out a LOT more light than the incandescent lights. Out of all of them, only one has a dead LED. This lost a half star to the dead LED and another half star because they say they will fit but they don't without modification.

I used this for my wall track curtains in my pop up camper.  It worked well.  It is a little stiff to sew.  You will need to drop the feeder feet and manually push the fabric through to sew this in.  I used a zipper foot to sew it and also worked in slow even stitches.  The finished product was worth it.  My curtains look great and are easily attached into my track system around the camper!

TAKE HEED! These will not work on a 2016-2017 Polaris General 1000. Every where you read, you will find they advertise that if they are for a RZR, it is the same bracket for a General 1000.. WRONG! With a 42" Curved light bar, I had about an 1"+ gap on each side. Too much to fill with steel bushings/spacers. I ended up having to bend them on an anvil to get them to work for now. I'm going to end up trying the OSP 5.6" bracket as it appears to stick out far enough to get roof off without having to disconnect LED bar, which is what I have to do right now.

So far so good. Installed easily on existing bracket on my 2016 jayco white hawk. The original started leaking this weekend, luckily I caught it before it vented all of the tank. I don't use the auto switch for this exact reason, I just turn on the tank that I want and use it until empty, then open the reserve and refill the empty. I did test the auto switch over on this new regulator and it worked as expected. I was really happy to see the made in USA stamped on this since I couldn't find one on amazon that specifically mentioned the country of origin. Flow is as good or better than the original, I did have to buy 2 new 12in pigtail hoses since the originals were not removable. I bought 2 camco 12in long  inverted male flared 1/4in hoses and they worked great.

I love the way these seat covers look inside my Jeep. What I don't like is the cheap elastic straps that hook the cover onto the seat. If Smittybilt was to charge a little more and replace the cheap elastic installation straps with sturdy straps or something I would gladly pay alittle more. After a short time of use the cheap elastic installation straps wear out and / or break. The seat covers look great and the pouches can be useful but be ready to rig a few things to keep the covers on your seats.

I have ordered several different yitamotor LED's recently to improve the look of my interior. I have not had problems with any of the others. These seem cheaper and on installing them I found only was was close to the expected white color. The others were inconsistent but were generally dimmer and slightly bluish/purplish in hue. That is a failure rate of 90%, so I am pretty sure these are knock off's. I am attaching a pic of the one decent bulb next to one of the others. Keep in mind my phone camera actually makes them look closer to the good one then they are.

I got 2 of these for our 2016 sportsman 450 and 570.  I did not want to permanently install these and did not want to buy a metal rack so I found these toggle anchors at Home Depot.  2 for $10.  They are rated at 333 lbs and with 6 of them on each the seat in in tight.  I did have to install some 3/8 washers due to bolt is a tad bit too long.  My 10 and 8 year old daughter love riding in the seat.  We also bought foot holders on amazon for stability when trail riding.  Hope this helps fellow Polaris owners.

While the front set fits pretty decent, they are not as tight fitting as the OEM guards. The rear set is horrible! they have a 1/4" gap between the top edge and the fender flares and don't even come close to covering the wear marks from the old OEM set that needed replaced. You get what you pay for and I wish I'd never bought these. If your picky like I am, get the OEM's!

And they are awesome. Very bright and have lots of function modes. I have a lot of products from Sunpie. I love them, very good products for great prices. So these rock lights are awesome. They are easy to install. Only two wires and work through your cell phone via Bluetooth to control them. The app is called BLEDIM and it works for both IOS and android phones. It is very easy to set up and use.  First thing you will want to do is check to make sure all the lights work.  First download the app. Then just connect the two wires to a power source. You can use the vehicles battery. Red to positive black to ground. Its time to pull up the app on your phone. Once the app is up and running touch the Bluetooth icon in the upper left corner. A box will appear if it doesnt already show the lights then push the search icon lower left corner of the box. It should now show the lights. You can name this anything you want like rock lights. Select the rock lights and it will say connection successfull then select the check in the lower right corner. If it cant find the lights go into the Bluetooth settings and manually connect to your phone then try app again. It should work  Once you confirm all is good lay out all the lights on the ground under the vehicle. Once You got everything laid out you will want to decide on your mounting locations for the pods. Be sure to make notice of any moving parts or hot areas like suspension parts and exhaust pipes and route your wires away from these areas. Zip ties work well for securing the wires. As far as mounting the pods themselves I use self tapping screws. You may also use zip ties just make sure they are heavy duty. They do come with bolts and nuts but mostly they are not good for mounting in most areas.  Once you have all the pods mounted and the wires routed you will need to find a spot to get the wires into the interior of the car. I believe you can mount the control box outside under your vehicle just make sure to put it in a spot where it is safe and out of harms way. I recommend if you can to put the box inside under the front seat. You will then run a red wire from either a 12v constant in the fuse box of directly from the battery to the red wire on the control box. Then find a nice clean ground for the black wire usually a frame bolt. Or the negative post of the battery.  Thats it your ready to play with all the settings in the app. And enjoy your new rock lights. I have had zero problems with the lights or the app. Always connects on the first try.

I had a mirror on my 2003 suburban that was so bad I could not see much. Everyday it was getting worse. I got my replacement mirror today and it took all of 5 mins to put it on. Before and after. I highly recommend this mirror for replacement for a fraction of the cost. I recommend using a silicone adhesive along with the adhesive tape that it comes with. Adhesive tape will hold it in place while the silicone adhesive is drying you will not have a problem of it falling off good luck. You won't be disappointed looks great and very clear

They are wrapped around a 9.5" rim and are stretched.255mm = 10.03" **Shouldn't be stretchedOverall I like these tires and I noticed the road noise decreased with these. They seem to handle great so far but a little disappointed in the width.I'll attach some pictures so you can get a better idea.

Saved me a trip to the repair shop.My trunk struts finally gave out after 10 years of service.These were a perfect fit.Go to Youtube for some ideas on how to change these...the package comes with the necessary screw driver to pry off the tension clips holding the struts in place. It's the only tool necessary, besides your hands.Prop the trunk open with a stick of some sort, otherwise, when you remove the strut, the trunk will fall and hit you in the head...I learned the hard way. : )

Honestly quite a pain to install. I knew that going into it, glad to have seen previous reviews fromother Fj owners. If you're into your FJ enough to buy this, trust me you will be going to the hardware store and buying a replacement allen screw to keep it from being wobbly and become solid. In my pics I tried to show the screw that came with the billet door, and the screw I had to get from home depot. One flat allen head screw that is the perfect length, I had to cut it just a few threads off to get mine to be perfectly solid. Also I rigged the gas door by drilling a hole into the end and attaching it to one of the screws and taking out the spacer. Not the prettiest when the door is open but 100% functional when openjng and closing so i'm ok with it. Looks great overall but took me 3.5 hours of struggling and drilling. And yes I did have to drill a third hole to make it solid, as you will most likely find out is pretty much necessary to be fully solid

Recently purchased a used, super-low-mileage motorcycle -- a 2006 with 2,500 miles -- all original fluids included.  The brake and clutch fluid looked like maple syrup.  I used this Prestone to flush and refill all the slave cylinders and now they operate smoothly, quietly and evenly.  Hydraulic fluid should be changed every couple years so probably any fluid would have been a huge improvement.  This is the DOT 4 fluid from a reputable company so I have confidence in the quality and performance of the product.

I have actually purchased these in the past from another seller but I didn't have enough to complete the interior so I ended up with 1 light having a weaker LED even though it claimed to be just as bright. They are so good that I had to buy more to replace the weak one.  These are definitely worth buying.These LEDs are very bright but you get used to it until you end up in someone else's car and see how dark it is. My car went from too dark to find anything to bright enough to do anything.They fit and installed perfectly. In most cars that can be done in a minute with a small flathead screwdriver.They look like they are built well and to a high quality. They are exactly as shown in the listing's pictures. They have a high light output in a bright white color. They are directional / one sided so you angle it to where you want the light pointed.I received these 31mm festoon LEDs to evaluate and review in an honest and unbiased manner.

Some of the slowest shipping I've had from amazon. Took 9 days to get here. They didn't offer prime. The rain gaurds fit my 2014 double cab great. I wish they were darker.  They are supposed to be the dark ones. The rears install in 5-10 seconds each and the fronts take no more than 30 seconds each. I wish they stuck out further. The rear ones stick out more. Maybe some day they will make it so they do. Also beware the rear ones do you have double-sided tape on them because they wouldn't stay without it obviously. The fronts do not need it. But when they say no tape no clue it's not really true.

Cosmetic rough surface more than anything else and you wouldn't notice this until it was unwrapped. Not worth returning but I would have rather had one that was 100% perfect and not 90% perfect. Shipped very promptly by the store. Not in a box but just the original plastic wrap around it with a shipping label. Defect was not caused by shipping but by manufacturer lack of quality control. Picture shows defect.

Perfect fit my 2010 F250 Super Duty Diesel 6.4. I really appreciated the instructions as they were nuts on. The hoses were exactly the right length for the instruction mounting position. I trimmed nothing off the Sinister hoses. If you have to relocate the filter unit, for whatever reason, be careful of hose length! I did add an extra protective cover split radiator hose to cover the Sinister hose as I was afraid the Sinister hose would get chafed by a nearby OEM angle iron brace. No bid deal. Had an old piece of hose, split it, and tye-wrapped it on. Will run it a while and then cut open the filter to see what is in the filter. I've currently have 86,000 miles on the engine. SCA Nitrate level was 0! Because I never checked it. After Sinister installation I added Motocraft Gold Fluid and Motocraft SCA additive. SCA now 1.2 plus.l will post later on the visual finds of cutting the filter apart. If I remember!

Excellent product! Install was nice and easy. Controls 6 differnt things without a huge wiring mess in the cabin. Switch pod fit great. No trimming of the interior panels. The only con is the bright volt meter not dimming at night.

Probably the best deepest black hard shell UV proof Urethane  paint on the market. It competes with powder coat for durability when fully cured.  Yet, the propellant has a tendency to remain IN the paint even after it hits the surface of the work. These,"expanding bubbles" mar the final finish----SOOOO, I found a better solution.  I "Spray" the well shaken contents directly into the reservoir cup of my HVLP "spray gun using a vail of Plastic Food wrap as a stretched-tight "hoodie" to direct it all into the cup.  This stuff has an incredible WEEK shelf life in the gun's cup!  The "Spray can" formula is NOT the same as "Top Coat" in a can using their thinner. ( No matter what their tech guys say).  Try storing thinned Top Coat from a bulk pint can thinned mixture- it will go off in a DAY!  If you have used POR15, you KNOW what I mean! I use this stuff every day in my business repairing Ferrari switch arms. See Photo attached.

I've been researching and reading reviews for a long time before getting this unit. Unlike most JKU owners, I tow an 18' Scamper Eco trailer. It weighs 3360 lbs. and the package makes for a go almost anywhere RV. Last weekend, we were at a mountain lake, the road of which would be difficult at best for cars. The main reason I went with the CAI setup was out of control intake manifold temperatures during towing in the mountains. I have an old cell phone on the dashboard running the Torque app which Bluetooth connects to a diagnostics port dongle. (Literally a "poor man's" $40 version of a certain $500 product that does the very same thing) Climbing up steep mountain grades, I've seen intake temps of a horrendously high 185 degrees, with tranny and coolant temps of 240 degrees. Something had to give. Installation was pretty easy. The MASS air sensor is tricky, you remove it from the old tube by twisting to unlock it. It used spittle to lube the sensor's O-ring and CAREFULLY worked it into the grommet of the new tube. Make sure the sensor sits broadside in the new tube, not inline. Install the silicone rubber tubing onto the main tube first, THEN onto the throttle body fitting, and tighten the throttle body clamp FIRST. The new tube goes on at a little bit of an angle, and will have to shift position after the throttle body is tight. Make sure to use the existing bolt on the fuse panel mount for the air box, there's a hole there for it. That end is easy as the silicon tubing with the flex hump slides on easy so you can position things at that end before sliding it back onto the junction. The EGR hose straightens easy and goes onto its new fitting without cutting it. I reused the OEM tube mount bolts with P clamps to secure the radiator overflow hose. First thing noticed: intake temps have plummeted just driving around town. Now, the intake air temp is around 12~14 degrees higher than ambient instead of the usual 30+ degrees it was before. I have just installed it, so haven't taken the trailer anywhere yet. I will update in the comments as soon as we go on our next camp trip. Intake noise is now a nice growl when I get on it, but it isn't too obnoxious. (I was afraid it might be loud and annoying, but it's not) It's silent when driving easy. Another thing: The OEM intake tube has huge chambers hanging underneath it, for what I assume is sound deadening. The oversized things HAD to have partially blocked radiator air, and now they're GONE. If that alone doesn't help with lowering temps, I don't know what else will. The Donaldson Powercore cleaner element is found in heavy equipment, semi trucks, and tractors all over the planet, (in various shapes & forms) so it's actually a major improvement in filtering over the OEM setup. I was surprised (disappointed & now, nervous) in the amount of super fine dust that is inside of the OEM intake setup I just removed. (19k miles on my 2014 JKU) I had to clean the MASS air sensor, and wipe out the throttle body with a clean cloth which turned black. DO NOT GET this CAI with an oiled element filter, they allow fine dust to leak through; read reviews on Jeep forums etc.Update July 12, 2016: Intake temps are running less than 15 degrees higher than ambient. Drive easy, and the intake temps are less than 8 degrees above. That alone is worth this setup. Notice the large air chambers on the OEM intake setup. They hang in front (behind?) the fan, and certainly block incoming radiator air. Getting on the gas pedal, it REALLY moves out, and after this much time, I don't think I'm imagining it. The growl matches what it's doing too, and a hard run, as in approaching red-line, and it sounds like it means business. Breaking the back tires loose and leaving stripes is almost too easy. Notice the photo of the inside of the OEM air cleaner housing. That fine dust was GETTING PAST the OEM filter! Mine still has fine dust all inside the OEM tubing, and as mentioned above, I cleaned it out of the throttle body when doing this upgrade. It would behoove anyone reading this to remove your air tubing and check it for fine dust. Do it NOW! If it's all clean, then hurray. Notice the "acoustic" cover is not there. It's in the garage rafters. Removing it made very little difference in intake temps. (It was already tossed when I installed the CAI kit)

The pan seems sturdy with a nice powder coating, the problem is the stamping on the pan lip is incomplete so without silicone or some other gasket maker it will leak.

I put these on a snowmobile and they are great! Much brighter than any led strip i have ever seen and durable so far. I have had them covered in snow and ice and they still perform. I have pretty much tortured them. Out on the trails at night they really make me stand out to other riders. I did have 1 out of the 6 that was defective and still waiting on company to see if they will make it right. Test them for 5 minutes before installing. After about 3 minutes, the faulty one got hot and would blink on/off. If the company stands behind the bad one, I will definitely be ordering about 10-16 more.

I have had this cover for two years but it only lasts 1 year in Arizona sun and the outer layer falls apart. Top Line just told me they will not honor my LIFETIME WARRANTY. And they want me to ship the damaged cover back to them and pay to send it to China, a cost of $38 for a $45 cover. The four layer claim is not true. It is a silver outer layer and cotton fuzz bottom.

I took the advice of another reviewer and put Saran wrap inside of the lug key prior to installation. So not to scratch the finish on the lugs. They fit the car and look flawless so far.  They contrast beautifully with my painted wheels and brake calipers and I can't stop staring. It looks sooo good in the sunlight. I'm expecting them to scratch easily and eventually fade from the suns UV rays but so far I'm loving them. I'll update my review in a few months to tell you how they hold up

These will move your floor boards out 1 inch and can be used to move them forward or backward by reversing the order in which they're mounted. You'll get better clearance from the air filter as well as opening up the entire floor board when an extended shifter is used for the heel or toe, depending upon your setup. The extended shifter shown is from Kuryakyn. If you have a lowering kit, there is a slightly increased chance of "sharpening" the floor boards when leaning into turns. This is especially true on tight off camber corners. I used these on three bikes, one with a lowering kit, and found that I prefer the boards in the forward position for my 32 inch inseam. Yeah, I like multiple foot positions with the two sets of highway pegs.

I recently bought Mother's wheel brush&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mothers-Wheel-Wheel-Well-Long-Handled-Brush/dp/B001GJ3E2K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mothers Wheel & Wheel Well Long Handled Brush</a>&nbsp;and after using it posted a review with before and after photos.  The brush did a nice job, but left a couple of tough stains behind.  I purchased Mothers foaming wheel cleaning to see if I can get those tough stains out.I covered the wheel with the foam, brushed with mother's wheel brush for about 2-3 minutes, and hosed off. Wow - no more stains!  I was impressed. And, of course, it did an excellent job with the break dust.  I have never seen my wheel that clean with just the car washing solution. I recently had back surgery, and still have discomfort when bending down.  So it is very important for me to find products that work well without putting much strain on my back.  I am very pleased!I am attaching before and after photos of the wheel, as well as a photo of the bottle next to a pen for relative size.  I will post an update when the bottle is empty. It will be interesting to know exactly how many washes I get out of the bottle.  I did not think I used much of the bottle content, the bottle still feels heavy.Note on price: I purchased this product on Amazon for under $8, as I am writing this review the price is $10.  So the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called  "Online Price Alert".  This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top.  I find this tool to be very helpful.

I've used this product in my 2010 Toyota RAV4 V6 for the past 4 years and have been very happy with it.  The metal upper and lower housing is almost impossible to find on an equivalent Fram, Purolator, or even Bosch filter.  I've never had one of these filters distort (get sucked in) or come apart (like some Fram filters have).The used filter in the picture was run for 10k miles with Mobil 1 5W-30.  I cut open about 1/4th of the filter to inspect it and found no metal shavings, and the overall condition of the filter was still very good.

We have a 2011 Kia Sorrento EX and I just noticed the rear wiper blade was hanging half way off last week, so it was time to change this baby out. These retail at the dealership for about $16, but here with Amazon prime it is $11.32This was an exact fit, they look exactly the same and Bosch is a name that I trust. I usually buy their parts when ever I can because I never have any issues with them. It took about 15 seconds to install, it is extremely easy. Just turn the wiper out and it slides out, put it and turn and it is in.From what I researched, this rear wiper blade should fit the following Kia's.Kia Sorrento - 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014Kia Soul - 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013Kia Rio - 2011, 2012, 2013 (the 2011 had to be manufactured after June)This is the same exact size as the Kia Part # 98850-2K000

Wow - I wasn't expecting it to work so well, considering how many people say it didn't work for them, but my repair is practically invisible!I followed the directions posted to youtube by ChrisFix and that was also a big help.I did have the glass resin leak while I was pressing down on the syringe even though I made sure I had a good seal, but I used tape to create a ledge to catch drips like Chris recommended, so this didn't create a mess. I was afraid that this would mean it didn't work, but it worked great and completely filled in the crack - there is a tiny spot that I can see because I know where to look, but if you didn't know, you probably wouldn't see it at all.I have had results at Safelite before that were no better than this. I used to have glass coverage from insurance and could get chips repaired for free at Safelite, but this time I would've had to pay $75 for a chip repair. I bought this kit for only $11 - I bought it locally because I couldn't get two day shipping from Amazon.I would recommend using the kit and watching the video from Chris Fix on Youtube before you start.

This is a great product. I bump my smartwatch (huawei)  every now and then, and it's bezel started having scratches (as you can see in the "before" pictures). Some gentle rubbing with Cape Code polishing cloths (as recommended) for few mins made my watch look like new again ("after" picture).There are two Polish clothes in the packet, but depending on your need they're are really good and enough. I just used one corner of the cloth for my smartwatch. Can't be more happy :) Thank you Cape Cod.

This product is awesome. I was surprised about the quality of it, and the design. It includes 2 an adapter in case your bars are thicker, if they are narrower then take the adapter off and you're set. Really straight forward product and when tighten it won't go anywhere. You get an awesome  and clear view of whats behind you.Installation:Place the screw with the expansion boot in the barsTighten the screw so that the boot expands and it grabs into the inside of the barAdjust mirrors to personal preferenceTighten everythingYoure done !

The shift knob itself is very nice, however the adapters are not and neither are the set screw holes. No threads in them. I took the adapter that fit my shifter and forced it inside of the largest adapter and pushed it down on shifter rod. Worked perfect. Nice and tight.

Fits my 2001 jeep xj really well and easy to install. I was worried about how it would fit in the rear because I have shackle relocation brackets with after market shackles and leaf spring but it worked out great. Louder than stock but doesn't have annoying droning while driving. I really like it so far.

Works better than I expected. I let it sit for about 20 minutes to warm up and this will cut grooves in a tire like cutting chicken breast fresh out of the oven. I can't say it cuts exactly like a hot knife through butter but this hot knife through tire cuts very well.

I was impressed by Motion Pro on this one. I like doing my own services at home and this tool keeps me in that groove. The Axis works like a charm and is fairly easy to use as long as you're careful. It's a simple tool but being careless with it can bend that awesome rod that allows you to mount the wheel and get it properly balanced. All in all I'm happy with it and I'm excited to see how well it holds up to the mileage of keeping my bike in good rubber.

Simple fixed open end water nozzle-how could you possibly screwitup.Obviously theres is not any quality control- and its not like these things don't cost $30.I pretested appeared ok. Installed and under low volume so hose didn't blow off like others have mentioned, look inside and the fitting with the hose clamped end is dry..look outside water is pouring out the 'factory' premade end. Sheesh- how do you fix that?Not like I can uninstall, with a hole in my tank, to return....I had noted the outer brass tube there was a gap between it & hose, not forcing hose tight on inner tube. I assumed some magic holding the hose inside. Not.CAMCO - the outer brass tube is supposed to be crimped capturing the hose. What we have is hose that is slipped over the inner tube.Nothing holds it.I had looked past the fact hose wasn't coiled which would survive package intact, but twisted so completely folded over in 2 places. Heat gun relaxed and reshaped. What utter sloppy junk...decent hose but as far as I'm concerned, deliberately folded up in package.I also assume Camco knows that once hole cut in tank most will one way or another try to make it work. Its just wrong people can sell stuff like thisI  used a mini tube cutter , went round and round till the outer brass separated. It left just enough room and exposed hose and inner brass tube to put a band clamp on. Haven't tried yet and doesn't matter as far as this review -5

This replaced the factory fog light on my 06 Acura TSX. My fiance installed it and I am assuming it bolted right up to where the factory ones were attached. I had to replace my factory fog lights because debris from the road had broken the lenses and they kept getting water in them and burning out the bulbs. These look just like the original ones, maybe even a bit better. They work great. The only thing is you have to take the front bumper cover off in order to properly mount the fog lights. The mounts are too difficult to reach with the bumper cover on the car. This is the only tedious part. I did purchase LED bulbs instead of the regular fog light bulbs. The regular bulbs had a yellow look to them and they did not match the HID bulbs of my headlights. The LED bulbs were also a bit cheaper than the conventional bulbs. I love that my car has fog lights again. They look great and put off a TON of extra light when they are on. I can see so much more. I forgot how much more I can see with them. The LED lights may help to put off some more light because they are brighter. I have no used them in fog yet but I assume they will work fantastically.

It's pretty good, but too early to judge long-term durability. The prep work is the hardest part, wash, clay, wash, compound, polish, wash again and do a final wipe down with some alcohol. Actual product application was fairly easy and took less than an hour. My only criticism so far is that it's not quite as glossy as a good coating of wax. It's still plenty glossy for most people, but I like that little extra shine. Oh well, I'm still more than happy with it and washing is now a breeze as the dirt just rolls off.

Warning defective Purolator FiltersI bought the Purolator L14460 for my Subaru a while back because it was a good price on Amazon.  Then today I had to run out to Advance Auto to get some oil and a filter for another car.  I Googled "Purolator" then I saw all these horror stories on "Bob the Oil Guy" about tears on Purolator filters.  Search "Purolator tears" to see what I mean.I did not want to believe it but the evidence was too many people with tears.  So after I changed my oil I cut apart the filter and sure enough on the Purolator Classic L14460 there was a small 1/8 inch tear on the bottom of the first pleat, just like others described it.  I could not believe it then I had an identical unused date code: F02F05D1 on both ( produced on Feb. 05, 2014) and the plears on that was fine and stright.  The used filter was more britlle when pushed with my finger tore easily.  It probably is not going to kill my engine but probably effected the filteration somewhat and may have affected the gas mileage becaseu of slight wear on the engine. Especially the main and only reason I am putting on the filter is to filter the oil and it's not even doing that.Then I went on Rock Auto sure enough a lot of stores are getting rid of their stock for $1.41 or less a filter, even Walmart is clearing our their Purolator filters. Some may say Purolator has changed their style of filter but I think the main reason is to clear out their defective stockpile of filters. DO NOT BUY A PUROLATOR FILTER a lot seem to have this tear problem.Oh I had about 5000 miles and 7 months on the filter, gently driven mostly on weekends to go to kids' sports activites, general errands and two long distance trips that totaled 400 miles round trip.  You can't get much gentler than this.NO more Purolator for me....: (

READ BEFORE PURCHASING the only thing this kit is good for, Air Filter and oil filter, and only for a grizzly 600. The oil filter you need for a 660, will not be in the kit. So, basically, if you buy this kit for a 660, all you get is an air filter.  The air filter will work on both a 660 and 600. The spark plug.....is wrong for both, the spark plug will not fit a 600 or 660. I bought 2 kits, one for 600, one for 660. They both came with the same incorrect plug. See the attached photo.  So be aware, this kit will not give you all three for either 660/ or 600.

Some don't. Jeep parts are costly and we love to add them so this was a bargain and huge help especially since im adding even bigger tires and flat fenders at the same time. It's nice to get a good product for a more than fair price to help with the Jeep struggle

I used the icarsoft i980 to diagnose, repair and clear the trouble codes on a w203 transmission computer. The TCM was not communicating with the rest of the car and I found an under voltage code which I eventually tracked down to some bad solder joints on the TCM plug. Once resoldered I used the i980 to clear the trouble codes which brought the transmission out of limp home mode and turned off the warning lights in the dash. This repair would've otherwise been impossible without a long and expensive trip to the dealer. In just one use the i980 paid for itself many times over.

A true bolt on, no drilling, no modification solution at a fraction of the cost of factory mud flaps. Installation is about 20 minutes as other reviews have stated. I chose not to drill the optional hole or the rear mud flap and just used the provided 3M tape and spring clip. I did not have any issues with holes lining up as others mentioned. These bolted on perfectly to my 2017 2500hd.

I've always heard that HID headlights are brighter than LEDs in the Volt's OEM projector housings, but I have been very happy with the LEDs that I have been running. I've tried a few different sets of LEDs, and finally landed on the Putco Silverlux Pro 6000k's ($150). These bulbs are made for projector housings, and use passive copper weave cooling, so you don't need to worry about cooling fans. These bulbs are "clockable" so you can rotate them in the housing to get the best light pattern. Like I said, I have been VERY happy with them. But... the more I read, the more I see evidence that HIDs produce more usable light. So... I decided to try an experiment, and I bought this inexpensive Innovited 55W HID 6000k kit ($48). I installed them today, and did some comparisons. I don't have a good LUX meter, but I did find an app for my phone that I could use. I figured if nothing else, it would provide a basis for comparison. The verdict is in... these HIDs that cost me 1/3rd the price of my LEDs produce 2X as much light! I have to admit that I am SHOCKED by the results.

LED  look  really good  i would recommend it to everyone.  The only problem i could notice is the harness it comes with, its very fragile.  The color ouput is 6000k i wish they had a whiter tint to them to make them look  more like OEM.  As you see in the pictures my low beams are 5000k  more white tint

These are awesome! Takes less than 10 min to install and have new upper mounting bolts for your XJ.  I lost one of the upper rear shock mounting bolts on my 2000 XJ, and used these to replace both upper mounting bolts. They slide easily into the large slot next to the upper rear mount and reach the previous stud mounting holes.  If you ever break a stud removing rusty bolts on your upper shock mounts, spin one of the studs or push a stud through, this is a great solution!

This is a great product. I uploaded images on the product a while back for you guys to see. I had a 2010 Base Toyota Rav4 and now I have a 2014 XLE Toyota Rav4. The cover fits PERFECTLY on my 2014 car. The cover feels loose BUT isn't on my 2010 car so it fits just fine.When I first used the cover on my 2010 car and got my new car, I took the cover off and put it on my 2014 car. The cover was fine, then I decided to take it off again and just buy a new one for my new car. When placing the cover back on my 2010 car, I noticed it was VERY loose. So just be warned not to take it off and on to place it on another vehicle, you might make it loose if kept on too long.This is also very good for driving long periods of time. The wheel feels thick and a little cushion like, but sturdy so it's great to have on.

Used on my 2015 Ram Promaster and they work.  Put in rivnuts on the bottom but self taping screws on the top pf the brackets as the room to work is too small on this vehicle.  The step works on both the driver's and passenger's sides.  They do not extend as far out from the sides as they did on my F150 but are fine.  I like them much better than running boards!

So far these have worked great.  It seemed to tighten up my steering.  Fit well.  I read in some of the reviews that they get covered in surface rust pretty easily.  So after reading that, I painted them with POR15 before I installed them.  After diving on a good amount of salt covered rust belt streets this winter I still do not see any evidence of rust.  So you may just want to shoot them with Rustoleum or better yet, POR15.  The metal was fairly porous and sucked the paint in quickly.  Other than that, great product.

Good product exactly what I was looking for, installed a set of 9007 bulbs on a 1993 Toyota Previa, plug and play done in like five minutes, good cut off,  no glare for other drivers, strong light output and hi/lo beam work perfectly. Don't know about longevity yet but I will report back in 6 months.Only relevant to Previa owners, since the headlights are so close to the cabin and driver you can hear the fans working (slight buzzing sound) when operating.

I purchased this can locally, but it is the same model. The newer reviews are correct... the design has changed and does not match the picture. You get a black spout with the red button. In general the button is hard to push in, and then a significant amount of pressure is needed to press in the nozzle. That along subtracts one, maybe two stars. But then there is the BS label with the instructions. It is one of those hypeannoying peel label back... double-sided types. Which would be OK, except the label is one of those terrible paper backed ones that shreds immediately upon trying to remove it. So in the end it took me 20 minutes to remove the label and residue, AND couldn't read the instructions. So that definitely looses this thing a star.So the only good thing... it holds gas

Finally, no tire sling and great shine...and it lasts. I'm sold. Buy this stuff. Use sparingly, let dry (30 minutes) and it works fantastic. Another fine product by Chemical Guys. They really have some super products.===========================Update 4/17/2018 - In addition to the tires (which it works great), I have used on the interior dash, center console and other plastic pieces on the interior of my 2017 Scat Pack. Works great! Not real greasy and leaves a shine. Note on certain car dashes this shine could be be a negative, but not the way my dash is angled. Just really good stuff.

The helmet is incredibly loud with wind noise, even at low speeds. For being so loud the helmet does not vent properly as any moderately heavy breath will fog the screen and it has to be opened to disperse.After 6 uses the strap began to Frey.

I purchased these Zwipes 894-4 Auto 5" Wax Applicator pads to use for waxing my SUV.  What I like most about the pads:1.) Arrived as 8-pack, but individually wrapped as 2-packs.  Easy to open. Great for storage.2.) Microfibers allow even coat onto vehicle for a mess-free, scratch-free, and lint-free consistency. Internal padding is just the right thickness.3.) Provides an even wax coating.4.) Pads wash well (see picture).Like most Amazon shoppers, I count on honest, unbiased reviews.  I hope you have found this review helpful in making your purchase decision.

My 2013 WRX had overheating issue which is known with Subaru's where it traps bubbles in the thermostat.  Without finding leaks and what seems to be a full reservoir, I was suggested to burp the coolant system.The fittings were perfect fit and I let the engineer idle for 15 minutes or so while I started to see bubbles after bubbles.  The process was very easy and I was able to to get everything done from start to finish in less than 30 minutes.The temperature of the coolant also dropped by 5 degrees or so at 178F driving without hitting boost at 65F ambient temperature outside.  Price well spent and the overheating issue at idle has gone away.  Excellent product and highly recommend it!

Bought this for my 2014 Honda accord Sport 2.4L,  very easy to install. I've seen a great increase in my fuel economy, I've been driving with the k&n drop in filter for a little over a month and have gone from 27 to 30 mpg. (Picture attached shows my average fuel economy for my last 4 fill ups). No noticeable power or acceleration but I wasn't expecting any extra power out of a drop in filter. Fuel economy and a lifetime washable filter was well worth the cost. Great and simple upgrade for your car.

Start off by saying shipping was on time, packaged very well. It has a very nice gloss look that matches my trucks factory color very well. Keep the 6 or 7 bottom clips off your old grille to put on this new one. Because this does not come with them. Over all very happy. 5 stars

This product is a fraud!  It doesn't pick up dust at all, it just pushes it around causing webbing all over my brand new  car!  I listened to the reviews and it was a big mistake..  I have no idea what they see in this thing. I have the California duster also and it worked a better then this thing did..  If anyone tells me I've used it wrong then there wrong because I used to detaile cars and I barely put any pressure on it while I was dusting

What can I say, this is my third K&N air filter, this one was installed in my 2011 BMW 335xi. The difference in performance is immediate and somewhat startling. I have no idea how much additional power is being generated, but it's fantastic overall. Low end torque is immediately improved an noticible, no increase in noise or other changes. For those that know BMW's, the 2010 335xi used the N54 twin turbo engine. I owned this vehicle and used KN air filters, it was quite a car. Then I traded it for a 2011 335xi, which uses the N55 "twin power" turbo - note the difference, this engine has only one turbo whereas the N54 has two turbos. There is a definite decrease in torque with the N55, and I was unhappy to say the least. My 2011 BMW had the sport package and nav, though, which is why I upgraded - the seats alone are worth the upgrade. Anyway, after installing this new KN air filter, my 2011 335xi runs with what appears to be at least the same, if not more, power than my former twin-turbo BMW. BMW should include these as standard equipment, for the price, it's a no brainer. Just buy it.

I find this very hard to believe that anyone can say this meets or exceeds OEM. I will challenge anyone who states at. I wanted to replace my pulley on my 2012 Mazda 3 2.0 MZR (non sky active engine Vin F). This is apprently the correct part number according to amazon and a few other sites. The original pulley on my mazda is solid and metal. This pulley is pure plastic and the fitment will not work with the original OE bolt and washer. To make it work I must not use the washer. Very poor part, the design is even different compared to OE. The OE is clearly different on each side, whereas this new part isnt.  Id rather continue using my 5 year old pulley that has a little play than use this cheap thing.Ive included pictures. The pulley with the red bearing is the new one next to it is my old one. As you can see they are slightly different design, resulting in not being able to use the washer. If you use the washer it will scrape against the new pulleys edge, likely ruining the plastic junk. I could have probably just not use the washer but the whole point of replacing this pulley was to make sure my car is done right;not wrong.You get what you pay for.

I used this for protection on my 2014 Honda CBR1000RR motorcycle.  Worked great for front protection, even, a few side spots. Applying it worked great, first piece was a learning one... but the rest went on very well.  The tape does handle tricky cuves/angles well.  Just need some time to apply it.I bought a tool to help apply the tape, useless.  Using your own hands is best, slow apply, easy goes it... it will look great.

Did it ever happen to you,some jerk cuts you off on the highway,and your only relief is to keep both hands on the car horn for few seconds? To your surprise,the horn is not honking! You check the connection or any limited knowledge you have about cars,and still,no explanation! After a trip to your mechanic,and a two minute diagnostic,he reaches out to the fuse box and changes one of these little things in my pictures bellow! Off course,you have to take care of Mr mechanic,after all, he wasted five precious minutes on your vehicle. That was my life story,about two weeks ago! So now I know where to look,next time,something electrical happens to my car! Although I wish it did happen after I accepted these 120 pieces as a test sample to review!!To make a story short,his is a simple inexpensive Ziploc bag with 120 fuses,with different amperage rating. If a fuse ever blows in your vehicle, you get to replace it with one of these! Just make sure you use the same size fuse, never use bigger or smaller ones.I did check the prices at a local Automotive parts store,you get few of the for a bout four dollars,five or six to be more accurate,whereas with this combo,you get 10 inline fuse holders,plus 120 fuses! And that sound like a great deal,when compared to the Auto parts store!! Still, if you're a skeptical person and not sure whether to trust other people's reviews or not! With Amazon's 30 day return policy, you have four weeks to try it out yourself, before returning it for any reason, with no questions asked, and in most cases Amazon will pay for the return shipping, in other words, it is a win, win situation!! With that said, I hope you find my humble opinion helpful in making or breaking your buying decision.

It's a nice looking rack flawed by poor hardware and instructions. The pros outweigh the cons once I had it installed but I was rather annoyed at times during the build and installation.Pros:-Very light aluminum pieces. Still seems sturdy enough despite the light weight. Easy to lift onto car and position on racks.-Large. Larger than I expected actually, although I measured the available space to get an idea of it's size prior to ordering. The air dam in the front adds about 8" to it's length. See the pics for an idea of it's true size.-Has a large interior volume and the bar layout makes tying things down easy.-I do like the look, would look great on a jeep or actual SUV. Still it looks pretty tough up there, tougher than my Subaru Forester actually is. Hope it doesn't get into fights in grocery store parking lots.Cons:-Very poor instructions.-Poor quality hardware.  I had to replace the plastic covered crown nuts on the rack mount pieces before installation, they came threaded on and several were cross threaded from the factory.-Rack was slightly tweaked once assembled, one corner was twisted upwards and sat almost 1" off my cross bars. I was able to pull it flat with the mounting hardware and a little effort.-Somewhat difficult to align all the pieces during assembly, mostly due to the defect that caused the twisting of the floor of the rack.-The mounting brackets leave something to be desired.  The u-bolts that go around your bars are poorly coated, the threads are poorly cut, and the excess chrome will make spinning the nuts difficult. Cheap hardware does not inspire confidence.  I also used a few stainless pipe clamps I had around as a safety, hopefully my cooler and other items will not suddenly attack the cars behind me.So a few pieces of advice for other purchasers.Don't think you're going to throw this together on the day of your trip. You may encounter problems; it took several hours and a trip to Home Depot to get it assembled and mounted on the car. Lining all the pieces up during installation was trying, especially without a decent guide to the order.If you need to replace the mounting hardware: The u-bolts I received require M6x1.0 nuts. You can find them in the specialty nut drawers at Home Depot or many hardware stores. Take your u-bolts to be sure. I bought stainless wingnuts and washers thinking I'd make mounting and removing a tool-less process and I regretted it immediately. Hand tightening them to the point at which I was confident in them was not fun since they are relatively small. A normal nut or even a nylock (part nylon inside to resist loosening) style would have been easier.Test fit the mounting brackets prior to starting assembly. They barely tighten down enough to grip my Thule rectangular crossbars, I actually used some self stick rubber pads I had for the feet of furniture to take up some space.Final thoughts:I'm happy enough with what I have for the price I paid for it. I do expect the bolts to rust and expect to replace them with stainless or otherwise rust resistant hardware at some point. I'd like to replace the u-bolts also but that will require some creativity. Now that it's all mounted I'm confident that it'll stay put for the journey it's going on.  I'll update this is anything unexpected occurs

For the money this is a great tow strap.  It's definitely not as robust as the $60 strap I'm replacing however at this price it's basically disposable.  I'm a big fan of the size, it will store nicely under my the back seat of my Tacoma.

Very easy install , it would be 20 times easier, not that it needs to be, to have the resistor mounted on the bracket.I guess the reviews where i read that its too small is where there is a ring of dirt, which a nice wash before putting them on will get rid of, other than that its perfect fit

Just look at the photo!!  After only four and a half months, these things look like crap.  My wife and I just bought two nice, blacked-out cars.  Black inside and out, black wheels, blackout packages on both.  Mine is a new Audi R8, and my wifes is a new Mercedes SL63.  And we ordered the new black California Legacy license plates.Our cars are garage kept, professionally washed every week, and we live in a very moderate climate in Southern California.  And no, we do not live near the ocean.  Probably 12 miles from the ocean.We both picked up our new cars 4 months ago, so these black license plate frames have been on our cars only 4 months.  I wanted a rather thin gloss black license plate frame that would cover the edges of the license plate.  This is the only one I could find that fit what I was looking for.  I was skeptical due to the low price.  I don't care about the price.  I should have known better.On the website the company claims: Enduring quality that can be both seen and felt.  And they say these are powder coated. The new black Legacy plates arrived today, so I took the plates off, and just look at what I saw on the license plate frames on BOTH cars.

I installed two sets of the FEBEST inner joint CV kits on my 2006 Subaru Impreza this past February 2017. Within two months of installation they began to show significant cracks in the rubber which only worsened over time. Both sets of CV boots ruptured within seven months of installation. Although the product comes with a one year warranty, the real cost of replacing the CV boots is the required time and effort to get them reinstalled. I contacted the sellers about the CV boot ruptures, which they offered to replace but since I already know their product is inferior due to both CV boots simultaneously failing, it didn't make sense to go through the same situation again. I decided to spend a little more money and just buy OEM Subaru parts to really fix the problem correctly.  See accompanying pictures of boot ruptures and wear.

Very good product. Only 2 minor complaints,one was a little loose as the base didn't seem as large around as the other. Also the turn signal should be a bit brighter than the running light for more contrast. I put mine in with dielectric grease to make a good contact all around.That said,Im impressed with the brightness that seems MUCH brighter to me than the stock bulbs. They are plug and play too,nothing else is needed to make them function properly.I would buy again,and recommend them,and really look forward to gen 3 of these bulbs. Got here in 4 days too,so again,thats very good IMO.I wouldnt buy any other brand after reading all the reviews on the LED 1157 bulbs on amazon.Buy them,dont worry,be happy!===============================UPDATE- Its been 18 months now,they still shine bright and its been the best cost/benefit upgrade Ive done to this old vehicle. If you have an older vehicle you will REALLY be impressed by the upgrade in light output.==============================Had them 3 years now. They are so good I bought the same ones only in 'switchback' style for the fronts. They are white on parking light mode(first pic),and when they flash they are amber(2nd pic).By em at 'the other place' for 13.49 delivered for a pair,amazon doesnt carry them.Find them as....JDM ASTAR 2pcs Super Bright 1157 2357A Dual Color White Amber High Power AX-2835 SMD LED Switchback Lights Bulbs for Car Truck Turn Signal Light & Parking Light or DRL (Daytime Running Light)

Pop & Lock bought from Amazon 2016-04-24 and installed on my 2014 F-150 XLT Supercrew. Pop & Lock dead by 2017-09-26. Yeah, yeah, 1-year warranty and all that, but I expect a long service life from a best-in-class product. Is that unreasonable to ask?Check out the picture. The motor housing cracked, inside the tailgate, somehow, during the Autumn season (not too cold, not too hot), and even now it spins in place instead of unlocking my tailgate.Worse, it disengaged the key lock so I couldn't get into the bed of my truck with the tonneau latched. I got lucky working the key while pulling and pushing on the release handle, otherwise, I'm not sure how I would've got the tailgate open without slicing into my tonneau.I'll update my review after I undergo the replacement process.

i bought this light about a month ago. at first i was skeptical about it because i never heard of wolo and i read mixed reviews about the company, but i bit the bullet and decided to get it anyway. to my great delight it wasn't a mistake! surprisingly bright, really moves traffic, very noticeable even in daylight, very, VERY strong magnets, don't really care for the coiled cord, don't like the double V mirrors for the simple fact that they are not wide enough, BIG bar, looks funny on my little Hyundai Sonata(think i'll put it on a truck when i get one), love the power switch.thinking about buying a second one and combining the two of them into one bar.

January 2017.I purchased this for my "05 Jeep Liberty CRD diesel.  The OEM PCV design is the same as the gas engine design which has proven woefully inadequate to suppressing the blowby gases that are generated at turbo boosted and diesel cylinder pressures.  Those higher pressures and particulate heavy diesel exhaust were overwhelming my air intake and subsequently the turbocharger and intercooler with a forced diet of soot laden oil.  This continuous diet of oil leaked out the turbocharger outlet and just made an absolute mess of the passenger side of the engine and undercarriage.  So much that I call my Liberty the DEEPWATER HORIZON II.Installation though not difficult required some thoughtful layout and fabrication of fittings to adapt the approximately 1" diameter ProVent connections to a more reasonable 3/4" hose size.  The most time consuming part was having a friend use his wood lathe to turn down two nylon barbed plumbing connectors so they slip fit into the ProVent inlet and outlet openings (which are tapered!)  I superglued them in place.  I mounted my filter directly in front of my airbox. I used two 3/4" 1/2" diameter pieces of aluminum tubing (cut with a tubing cutter) to form spacers to hold the filter behind the Air Conditioning liquid line that runs next to the radiator supporting cross member.  Two 2" long hex head sheet metal screws were drilled horizontally toward the front into the radiator support member to the right of the windshield washer fill cap.  You have to select which of the multiple grooves on the filter body you want engaged in the mounting bracket so the filter connectors and the filter height work to clear the hood and adjacent airbox and air hoses.  I used 3 - 3/4" 90 degree barbed plastic fittings by Lasco to cleanly snake the inlet and outlet hoses around the front corner of the airbox and then the third one to drop the hose straight down onto the PCV to air stream inlet located on the inlet air hose.  This made for minimal obstruction to the turbocharger outlet hose.You will need to modify the airbox.  I hogged alot of the front of the housing away.  Probably more than needed but the engine ain't in want of air flow and since I do not ford rivers with my daily driver I am not too concerned about it ingesting water.  My original intent was to tie the ProVent drain to a hose coupled to the ProVent check valve and then "Y" it into the turbocharger drain line.  That proved way more involved than I had time or patient for so I just drilled about a 1/4" hole in the top of a clear plastic screw cap container ( I used a medical specimen cup) and then forced the cap over the drain outlet of the ProVent.  So now I have an easily accessible ProVent and outlet drain capture device intercepting the steady PCV flow.  The drain collection holds about a 100ml's and after about two weeks of driving I can barely see any oil accumulation.The ProVent was available for less elsewhere but my gift card and  Amazon Smile benefit to Drs. W/O Borders made the who to buy from decision easy.  The jury is still out the performance of the ProVent but initial observations are promising.The vent would be more user friendly if they made available some transition adapters so smaller hoses could be fit to it.

I have bought one other set of seat covers from this company that were the exact same, just a different color. The problem with these is that when they arrived they were missing pieces, missing clamps, and were not cut specifically for a split bench seat.  After about one hour of an intense sweaty installation, I made them work but it required a razor blade and they do not look as good as the other set that way on the exact same car.  Three of the headrests we're missing in the back, and the backseats did not fit well at all. Also the backseats do not have zippers or separations to fit the split bench seat. The first that I bought has zippers so you can separate the two seats. I'm not happy with this product but with all the work I did put  it on I don't think I will be taking it off and send it back either

Very happy with my purchase. I just installed it, a little smaller than the original fan but does produce a lot of air. As far as an increase of speed, not really.

Complete garbage. The pegs aren't level; they are casted so they angle forward 5*.  The springs don't fit properly so that the pegs spring back, and the pins don't line up.I bought these for a 2008 KLX 110. I knew they were a cheap alternative, but didn't think they'd be this bad. Don't waste your time or money.

Not much to say, it's a gasket. The issue I had, and I ended up not using it, is it isn't stamped out correctly. It's missing one of the bolt holes. You could cut your own but I bought it for a specific application and it didn't fit.

Been using is for about 3 months, but honestly think it's more comfortable than my 2011 Arai RXQ.Feels and sounds solid. Sweet paint job/graphics, I get a lot of comments on how it looks. Fits snugly and is comfortable, ears are designed for a headset or buds. Three vents move the air well, I haven't had any fog-ups on cool mornings. The sun shade is handy and easy to raise/lower. Arrived in solid packaging and has a nice drawstring bag to store it in. I honestly can't think of anything negative to say about it. Granted I haven't tried to wash the padding yet, so can't comment on that. Hopefully I'll never find out just how durable it truly is, but it really is very similar to my Arai, weight wise, interior/exterior design wise, "squeeze test", etc, so I think it'd hold up well. Can't be beat for $120 and Prime ship. I'll be buying another one (different color probably) for passengers.

I just put these on my 09" CBR600RR and they look sick! The tape compliments the bike's color scheme really nicely. The tape also is extremely sticky and durable, that was the first thing I noticed. They were very easy to put on without an applicator. I used a rear stand and that helped. For 35$, you cannot beat this deal. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!I added pics w/ and w/o flash, and pics in the shade and in the sun. Check for yourself!

Bought this Shark 3-inch antenna for my 2006 Toyota Corolla S to give it a sleek look, and unfortunately it doesn't fit perfectly.  The roof of the car has a slight curve to it that the shark fin antenna is only designed for completely FLAT 180-degree roofs.  Even though Amazon says this fits my '06 Toyota Corolla.... It doesn't quite fit.  The 3M Sticky also doesn't stick/hold well either, or maybe it isn't strong enough to hold the front and back end tightly enough to make this antenna actually work with slight curved roofs.Today will be the first day I'll be driving in rainy/wet conditions to give this a real test.  I have a feeling it's either going to fly off my roof, or won't be able to use it at all. Hopefully it doesn't ruin my radio connection. I'll update my review  later.BTW-  the original antenna came in Black. I was able to have my mechanic paint it the same color as my car (Toyota's Indigo Blue) for a perfect color match.  Please see my photos attached.

These lights worked out great on a trailer. They were definitely bright enough to see in my rearview mirror while driving at night, and were clearly visible from a distance. They were almost brighter than my actual taillights...I used the included bezel on two of them, had no problem with fitment. The other two were being placed in a location that was not conducive to the bezel. And thought he Bezel was a nice chrome finish, I painted it to match the trailer.I will probably buy several more of these for other trailers that need lighting.

We bought this lock about a month ago and we live right on the beach with no rust issues! It fit our fj cruiser perfectly. We used it so no one would steel our toe hitch 4x4 emblem. Also to avoid rust we sprayd a bit of wd-40 in the lock and worked the key in and out.

I put 2 layers to get a more opaque yellow. Does wonders to heat up before and during installation. Covered up fogged up (ironic) fog lights. Yellow fog lights are popular due to looks and the ability of yellow lights to cut through fog better.

I bought item somewhere else because it was cheaper option at the time for my 2007 GMC Yukon. But it fits perfectly. I do recommend purchasing the Walker 31718 gasket as well with catalytic converter y pipe because this walker setup does not have a circular cutout for the ring gasket on driver side. I re used the OEM donut gasket that came with original catalytic converter y pipe. For removal and installation, it was easier to remove transmission cross member. I do suggest getting the nuts threaded on driver side first then move to passenger side and exhaust. Once you have all nuts started on threads, tighten up driver side completely and then others from there.

Fit my 2014 Silverado 5.3L perfect.  Finish looks great. Clamp is a nice band clamp not a cheap U exhaust clamp. This is the 10" one. I thought about the 14" one, but I'm glad I got this one. The 14 would have been too long with the factory tailpipe. I did cut about 3" of the tailpipe off with a sawzall.

Looks great on my motorcycle. Breaks up the gold a bit, over priced in my opinion. Quality feels super super cheap. I believe they claim to be metal caps. But they are definitely plastic. They don't come with a rubber seal like other caps if you are the type that pays that much attention to detail. These caps only looks good.

These will have to be trimmed for a Jeep Wrangler JK. The front cup holders are each a different size and the back 2 are small as well. You can trim down to the inner ring or try to slowly slim it down to try to get an exact fit. I did the best I could and am happy w the look and quality. Time will tell if they hold up.

Prime Choice Auto Parts RK782 New Complete Aluminum Radiator fits perfect in my 4 cylinder Jeep. The original started leaking a couple of years ago near the top seal. Decided it was time to replace while I had the fan shroud off doing a alternator replacement.The only customizing I had to do was to knock out a pre-scored tab for my AC line. The radiator comes with pre-installed automatic transmission connectors. I have a manual transmission, so I did not need to use these connections. Just leave the shipping caps on there and you'll be fine.I will have to agree with the fact that packaging needs to be more substantial. It comes packed in the manufacturer's packaging. Basically, a box with styrofoam nestling the radiator on both ends and another piece strategically placed to keep the box from collapsing. Some of the fins were bent, but not enough to be concerned.Also, will have to confirm that for the price, you can't beat it. Fits much like OEM, high impact plastic top and bottom with metal side flanges and aluminum core.Radiator comes with drain plug. Buy new hoses, clamps, and cap with all the money you've saved! Heck, throw a thermostat and serpentine belt in with that too! This would be a good Saturday/Weekend project.Hope this helps!

I broke the OEM plastic wiper arm on my MY16 Expedition trying to remove the blade....that "snap-on" design sucks. I replaced it with this arm; it fits perfectly. Even if you haven't broken the arm yet....this arm has the "hook" style connector which is way easier to work with.I paired this with the 13inch Bosch Icon (Model 13A); IMO, best blades you can buy.

I have purchased other MSD coils, some that are still in use after many many years. However; this is the second one of these types I have purchased and this particular one didn't even last one year. I wanted to know why these aren't lasting so I removed the top part of the casing from the coil to figure it out - It seems that the effort answered my question.Summary:It appears that the demise of this coil is due in part to materials that break down under heat and a design flaw that places the high voltage terminal too close to the grounded part of the E-coil which cause the spark to arch to ground and a design that locates the high voltage lead too close to the iron core ground.Details:It appears from destructive investigation that the high tension lead is too close to the iron winding core of the coil.1) The high tension lead is approximately 5mm from the the iron E-core coil winding frame as compared with the stock coil that puts the high tension / high voltage lead at about 20mm away from the iron core.2) It looks like MSD uses epoxy as an insulator which appears to break down and allows high voltage to arc through the material to ground - Rather than use epoxy for the potting material, competitors seem to be using a urethane potting compound that may not break down as easily.Hope this helps,- DIY Man

Ive come to find that when purchasing car parts and accessories that youll use just about every day, its better to spend a bit more money and get something with great reviews. I chose these over the trusted brand WearherTech because I was trying to save some money. I have a 1997 Civic Coupe, and Im really disappointed with the poor fit of these. These don't quite follow the curve of the window frame perfectly, and they don't even extend all the way to the side mirrors. There is a one inch gap between the end of the window visor and the side mirror.The biggest disappointment, however, was the mounting tape this came with. It barely held on to the window frame. It popped off after about 10 minutes of being stuck on, and there is no way it wouldve stayed on with regular use. I had to buy some 3M extreme mounting tape to get these to stay on permanently. Even with the strong tape, these still shake a bit when the car is going anything over 55 mph.If I had bought these at an auto parts store, I wouldve returned these and bought a better brand, but since I don't want to deal with the hassle of sending these back and being out more money, I am just going to deal with them.If you are in the market for some of these window visors for your civic, Id keep looking!

The only negative I see other than they will a complete pain to get off when its time for servicing stuff like coolant and air filter, is the plastic plug on the right side that covers the bolt hole. I'm going to see if I can get a spare from MC for when I have to remove them later.They weren't difficult to install just time consuming. I used a ratcheting box end wrench to tighten the bolt that is inside the fairing. It was extremely tricky trying to get the nut on the bolt inside the fairing but I managed to do it by putting the nut on before fastening anything to the bike. If you have really small hands this step may be easier.I've attached some photos of the where the cage bolts to the engine and the separate bracket that reinforces the cage. The bracket attaches with a nut & bolt at the top and an allen screw at the bottom.

I purchase the StowAway Hitch Tightener to work with the CURT Cargo Carrier which I was ordering a the same time.(My vehicle - 2015 Chevy Tahoe - Factory tow package)This will be my first time ever using a cargo / trailer hitch so I really wasn't familiar with a lot of the terms and potential issues that were being talked about in reviews and Q&A.In on of the reviews a person recommended this hitch tightener.After installing the cargo basket I tried to wiggle and bounce the cargo basket and just like the review indicated there was a lot of play . . a lot more then I would want going across this country on Interstate 80 at 75mph.I installed this hitch tightener as instructed with no problem. I bounced tested it in my garage and also on the road . . . a dramatic improvement . . Very easy to install and also to take off when through with the cargo basket / or trailer.Very good heavy duty quality.PS - As you might have noticed from the picture I also bought and installed a locking hitch pin. With the cargo basket I bought being very light I felt it was very vulnerable to possible theft so that is the reason for the purchase. Keep in mind and you might see this that if a professional wants to steal your carrier or trailer they can . . A locking pin will stop the random theft, deter, delay or even draw attention to a theft in progress . .

It's an even cheaper knock off of a light that's already pretty crappy. (Tuff Lights, but at least they work)When I opened the box I was surprised at how light weight they were compared to the "real" versions of this light (I have 9 or so of them on various pieces of equipment)One dead row out of the box. We'll see how long the rest of them work.

Overall, I like it... but it's far from perfect. The swing-out functionality is good, and more useful than the fixed-mount toolboxes. Plus, you need the ability to remove it to store stuff. I chose the passenger side to start - the drivers side covers factory GM trailer receptacles - though I may add the drivers side if the passenger side goes well.Caveats:1. On the GM trucks (and perhaps others) there is NOT 48" of room between the swing cases if you go with two, so you can't move sheet goods without removing them. With only one installed, there is BARELY enough room to move sheet goods.2. I worry about the strength of the plastic. The first one came with a huge crack in it from Amazon despite the factory box being perfect, and it seems pretty thin considering a lot of people plan on putting things like receivers and balls in it. I would think it would be fiberglass-reinforced plastic, structural foam, or similar to handle this.3. The same box is used for long and short-bed trucks, so it leaves a bunch of unused space between it and the wheel well in a long-bed truck, and to be honest the mechanism probably wouldn't handle a whole lot more length to it so maybe not a bad idea.4. The installation is easy, but I hated the idea of cheap self-tapping screws. I used stainless steel rivet nuts and stainless steel button-head screws instead (M6) and it looks a lot better, and if it ever had to be removed the stainless rivnuts could be easily painted to match the bed or bedliner.5. Being empty plastic, the whole thing rattles and slams with every bump. There's a lot of play/flexibility in the mount and box itself so the box vibrates around empty, then add everything in it rattling around if it's not soft. I am going to try bedliner inside to quiet it down and reduce the pounding.Overall, it's the best solution for storage in that area, but it could be significantly improved.

Horrible. They're BLACK not gunmetal. Seller is horrible and ignorant and difficult to work with. Basically told me to go screw. They Grew up with the wrong box of crayola crayons. Here's a pic next to my BLACK truck, and next to some real GUNMETAL wheels. Oh and the wire they come with is a terrible fit. Would most likely break if I actually tried to install them. I left these ugly BLACK things in the box.

They look quality but it's just not there. They look nice on the car when installed them took me less than 10 min. As you can see in the picture it's cheaply made and not quality control checked, I didn't bother returning as I got them for $42 from amazon about $20 cheaper so I figured that won't bother me too much. Overall They are ok

There's nothing wrong with these sprayers - you put WD-40 in, and spray. Don't know how long it will last - hopefully quite awhile.Don't like the blue "childproof" refill cap? Remove the outer blue "childproof" part - easily done with nippers and needle nose pliers - see picture.

I had only about 5000 miles on these and the driver's side caliper completely locked up. I had to pry it off after having the truck towed home. The truck did sit for about three months due to a transmission failure and it isn't a daily driver. However, I'm VERY dissatisfied.

AEM is a well known company in the car world, and makes high quality products. I purchased this gauge to monitor my AFR and log for open source tuning purposes. Installation was painless and took roughly 20 minutes since my downpipe already had a bellmouth o2 bung. I strongly recommended that you buy an add-a-circuit fuse kit (ASIN B01LFXA5UA) if you don't have any, it will make installation much easier so that the gauge can be powered by one of your car's powered circuits, like the radio. I had a few spares laying around, so I spliced this gauge and a boost gauge to one fuse kit without any problems. The kit also comes with several butt splices although one would suffice. The cables for the gauge are extremely long, so be aware that you must have adequate room to tuck them away. I paired this gauge with an AEM boost gauge (ASIN B001DX7KMY) and SMY Dual Gauge Cluster (ASIN B01M7MEKUS). The numbers are also very readable in the day time and stand out in the night, although the sweeping color band is a bit washed out during the day but still visible. No issues with this gauge and I'm very pleased! The AEM sticker that came in the box was a bit damaged, so I only gained +4 HP instead of the expected +5 HP.

Great looking replacement to give your old yukon/tahoe a nice modern look. great price and easy direct replacement. 4 stars because the clips that are used to secure are not as strong as originals, the plastic is cheaper oem. one of the clips broke on my because i didn't install it correctly the first time and the clip got jammed and broke when i removed the clip. I had to McGiver it with a drywall screw to hold it in place after it broke. Other than that, they are cheap and look good.

Installed this on a 2000 Town Car. I had an tube nd fin cooler in line with the OEM cooler but was not enough with my high performance motor and 2600 rpm stall converter. Was seeing temps at times going over 210 when  not in lock up or under hard acceleration. Installed this cooler which may seem like over kill but happy with results. Now temps stay below170 no matter what driving conditions I put the trans through great product. A lot of hardware came with cooler but wish they would of included an extra fitting besides the one that allows you to install barbed fittings on flared trans line. Due to the size and configureration I did not want to run that much rubber tubing so made my own lines from 3/8 tubing from auto store. I was only able to put barbed fitting on slif the hose over tubing for 2nd line. I guess I'm just nit picking but cooler was worth the few extra steps. I would like to also commend vendor who removed hardware bag from cooler box and placed in shipping box so it didn't damage fins on cooler during shipping nice touch

Ok so.....before I put these on...my switchbacks flickered like crazy and there was a weird noise inside the cabin....,when I installed these.....and I do not know much about car electronics, the lights no longer made the noise but they still flickered.....I thought I had wasted my money but like ALL PRODUCTS THAT GO ON CARS...there is a break in period....Once I turned the car on and engaged one turn signal at a time then I used the hazard lights which enable both to be used at the same time for about an hour....the lights started to slow down....The following day after having these installed, when the car is NOT ON and you try to use the signals they blink with no noise, but it's very quick.....Once I TURN ON the car....it slows down, and works perfectly...I'm glad I waited rather than say it doesn't work....to have avoided returns and wastin time and effort...Overall solid buy....just my own experienceOn a 2001 mustang with led halo headlights and Aaron switch back turn signals

I have included some pictures to better understand the difference, however it does not fully do it justice. I replaced 9 bulbs on my 2007 Toyota Prius. The two brake light bulbs, both front parking light bulbs, both door light bulbs, and the 3 front interior dome light bulbs. I did not change the 2 license plate bulbs, and the trunk light and the rear dome light are different bulbs all together. I was pretty damn impressed at not only how much brighter the bulbs were but also how much whiter they were as well.I have included pictures for comparison to show the difference, and as you can see just from the door lights alone how much of a difference it makes and to help you make a more informed decision.

The only question is why aren't these included as a stock item?  Installed in my 2012 Camaro SS.  15 minute installation and you're done.  Very clean white light even in daylight as the before and after pictures show.  Matches the color temperature of the halos just right.  No troubles with loose connections or anything.  As always, be careful when removing and reinstalling any part, don't use the bulb as leverage.  Shipped in 2 days for Sunday delivery just as purchased.  Giving them 5 stars for now.

Direct bolt in for a 1999 F-150, however should fit any 10th generation F-150 (1997 to 2003). To replace both left and right sides you will need a hour of time, Philips head screw driver, T27 bit, needle nose pliers, and 10mm socket. Its simple enough you can just jump in on the project with little to no YouTube research. The part comes with OEM labels (picture 1) and side by side is the same size as the old part (picture 2; sorry for the bad quality, too lazy to go back in).Two things to note: 1) You will need to save the three bolts for the actual locking mechanism. 2) You will need to save the yellow clasp (picture 3) from the old part and transfer over to the new part. I recommend you transfer the part once you put the new lock and cable into the door so you can line up the adapter perfectly. If you lost/broke this connector, this appears to be the correct piece, the yellow one in the middle being the piece in question.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dorman-75473-Door-Component/dp/B00542X7AY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dorman 75473 Door Component</a>As for longevity of the part, I just installed it about 2 hours ago, so no comment there. However it looks identical to the old one, which failed at 170K miles, so it should be good enough. I would buy this product again if needed and I would recommend to a friend.

This scanner is an excellent buy for the price. Uses the same ELM 327 chip that many expensive ones also do. It does not claim to have firmware version 2.1 like some other cheaply made ones do. It is version 1.5 and works well enough.This is the first such device I have owned, and it worked like a charm in my car (I was crazy enough to test it on my new car). The light on the scanner turned red to indicate it is operating, almost immediately showed up in the BT device list on my phone, and I paired it using key 1234. I am using Torque Lite to test it, and may buy the pro version later on. Searching for fault codes returned "There are no codes stored on this ECU", which was as expected. I tested many of the gauges, some of which I have posted in pics.The device does get a little warm after use but I believe that is normal.I received this product at a discount for an honest and unbiased review, and the above is the true account of my tests. Giving it a 5-star rating because there were no hiccups using it, and it does what it claims, that too at such a low price. If you find this review helpful, please click the Yes button below!

As advertised. Used in an 03 F250. Great alternative to cutting and splicing the OEM harness. Done that tons of time. This was quicker and easier. If you're not planning on running new speaker wires then I would recommend this.

I purchased four different Windshield visors and decided to go with this one out of the four. .even tho I'm not completely happy with this oneThe other three were of very poor quality and didn't fit the shape of my car even though they were specifically made for my make & model.The shape of this one is off by quite a few inches too but I will "deal" with it for now.As you can see in the pics, there is a 2" gap on the right side of my rear view mirror and then more like a 5" gap on the left side allowing way more light in then I'd like.I was going to return this one as well, but figured I "Needed Something" to cover up and protect the dash from the harsh UV out here in the desert.

I have an 2006 E66 (the only year you have to remove the entire bumper cover).  The connections match up very snug once you remove the pigtail that comes with the new bulbs. I was very pleased how the lights visually paired up with the factory Xenons.  Initially after the install, I was receiving a cornering light malfunction, I disconnected the battery for an hour, and after reconnecting the code was gone.  I've had them for over a month now, no issues.

Fit well - once I figured out to remove the stock rubber mat in the tray.Snapped right into the post holes in the stock tray, and fits snug enough. Feels like polypropylene, so we'll see how it does vs. the Arizona sun. It's made in USA, by a company who "gets" trucks and off road, so I have high hopes.There are no instructions, but it's kinda one of those things where, if you can't figure it out, you probably munched too many paint chips as a child.I'm gonna modify mine somehow. The shape just begs for it.Also, spiffy huge sticker included!Update: A month+ in 120F+ outside temps (can get over 160F in a dark vehicle like mine) have not warped this thing at all. Nice!Photo was taken today, 7/9/17.

At $21 cheaper than etrailer, I'm very happy with this purchase. Took a little longer to receive than ordering directly from etrailer, but once shipped it came very quickly. Instructions were clear. This wasn't too hard to put on - had I used a lift it would've been easier. I would say get a friend to help - keeping the hitch suspended while laying in the driveway, and trying to feed the bolts through the holes is a bit of a chore. Could've done this in 20 minutes with another set of hands.

Good product but no instructions as stated by several others.  Some have said that if you email the company, they will send instructions.I installed these today and will include a few pictures.  Be sure to drill pilot holes first.  The first picture shows the barrel of the support screwed to the inside of the face frame.  I used a longer sheet rock screw because as others have noted, the supplied screw is too short to support the leverage generated when the door closes and the internal spring compresses.  I measured down from the inside top ~5.5 inches.  The second picture shows the flange screwed to the door/lid.  I measured ~1.5 inches down the door for the screw that is the furthest away from the door hinges.  The screw that is closet to the door hinge is~ 3/4 inch down from the hinge side of the door edge.Hope this helps!

Got these lights as gift and I do in fact like them, though there is one thing I don't like about them, but i'll get to that at the end of the review as it really isn't a deal breaker. The design of these lights are quite nice with their rugged finned aluminum body, menacing array of large LEDs, and large 7" diameter. They are as simple as it gets when it comes to what's included. You get two lights, mounting hardware and +/- red/black connecting wires. If you are replacing old-school halogen lights that you already have, then these should be a direct connection to the existing power leads. In my case, I knew I was going to be doing a fresh install on my 1975 GMC Jimmy, so I got a standard automotive relay, a 30amp in-line fuse and a small toggle switch. Installation took about 3 hours, but that was a fresh install, with relays and a hidden switch.First impressions when firing these up were "WOW, these things are bright!" and "Dang, now my other lights on the front of the truck just look dim and yellow in comparison... but I'll upgrade the lighting later." The only bad thing about these lights, and again, this may be a deal breaker for some but not me, are that they emit some serious junk radio frequencies when they're on and can cut out your FM radio stations making it impossible to hear the radio when driving. You can drastically reduce the effect of the junk frequencies by snapping on some ferrite magnets on the power leads, but that doesn't fix it completely.Overall, am very happy with the end result! They look awesome, bright as the sun and give my classic 4X4 a little bit of a modern flare.

Im going to give these 4 stars because Lund really needs to upgrade the trim and use the bushwhacker adhesive trim. Theyre made by the same company so it wouldnt be much cost at all to use the better trim. Install wasn't difficult, just time consuming. I needed about 2 of coverage and these did the job.

I DEFINITELY LIKE THE H.I.D KIT.. I BOUGHT 8K THE FIRST TIME FOR MY MERCURY AND WANTED TO GO WITH A MORE BLUE HUE SO I BOUGHT THIS KIT IN A 10K FOR MY TOWNCAR BUT THERE NOT ANYMORE BLUE THAN THE 8K I BOUGHT PREVIOUSLY FOR MY OTHER CAR.. THE OPT7 ARE A GOOD H.I.D KIT BUT I WAS UNSATISFIED WITH THE LACK OF THE 10K HUE OUTPUT..BUT NONE THE LESS A GREAT AND EASY KIT TO INSTALL.. I LIKE THE FACT IT COMES WITH THE WIRE HARNESS RELAY AND THE CAPACITORS... HAVE NEVER FAILED ME YET.. BUT 4 STARS REGARDING THE 10K OUTPUT...

Nice quality, cables were to short even for my 1996 Honda 300 4x4 which isn't a very big machine so be aware of that if you have a bigger quad. And the circuit breaker that comes with it is just a big block of bare metal which will corrode and could cause serious problems if it happened to touch your frame and ground out. For my placement of the circuit breaker I covered it in numerous coats of liquid electrical tape and put a big rubber barrier around it. 4/5 stars due to minor problems.Update 6/27/16:This winch has proven itself time and time again, has been submerged countless times and is super strong. Would definitely buy again if I ever need another!

Good product and fairly easy to install at home.You will need extra tools: 5/16 Allen, 17mm socket, and a drill set (namely a 5/16 drill)The finish on the brackets were marred up a bit but the poles looked fine.

Easily installed on 1997 Civic HX (after breaking stock bolts loose).  The instructions leave something to be desired BUT Dorman's online chat service is top notch if you need it!  Remember to buy new header studs/nuts if you're doing a time sensitive repair, they break easily if you aren't careful and are often in rough shape, the kit doesn't come with them (I'm not saying it should).

The lights produce a nice solid bright spot of light, and the housings seem very welkl built, however the mounting hardware and bracket arease of a ferrous metal that will rust. Since I live at the shore, I will have to swap all the hardware out for stainless steel. Also one of the reflectors was in at an angle, not bug deal for function, but it is cosmetically detrimental.

So I've heard a lot of online talk about Simichrome and Flitz.  I have always used Flitz myself but decided to try Simichrome.I took two 6061 aluminum plates and sanded them both evenly to 400 grit.  Started with 120 to remove minor surface imperfections and 400 to smooth it out a bit.  I then went over them briefly with 1000 grit.I did 1 application of both and the Flitz was the clear winner.  I ended up having to do 3 applications of Simichrome to achieve the same result.I will say sanding makes a world of difference.  I normally sand to 2000 grit first which after flitzing produces a great reflection.

Up front. I got this for half price, which is nice, because I've wanted one of these for a while now.  Most of the reviews are favorable, and this is no exception.-----------------------------------------The box is your standard box, with only the Thermometer and a manual included.  The handle opens up where you install two AAA batteries.-----------------------------------------I don't own an expensive IR thermometer to compare accuracy to, but casual testing things like the oven and clothes drying seem accurate enough.----------------------------------------The manual states to pay attention to the "distance to spot size".  For example, if your target is 1.5" big, hold the gun no more than 12" away.  If your target is 3" big, no more than 36" away, and if your target is 5", no more than 60" away.  You will get the idea pretty quick.Also, there are things like emissivity to keep in mind. (Emissivity is the measure of an object's ability to emit infrared energy).  In other words, if you have two black objects and one is painted flat black, and the other shinny black, you will get a more accuarate temp reading from the flat black object.  This goes the same for various objects.  There is a basic table with emissivity factors pre-programmed into the thermometer.  The distance table is conveniently stickered on the side of the gun, along with the "caution you'll shoot your eye out", laser warning.  In other words, don't let the kids mess with it.---------------------------------------The operation if this is very basic.  Determine the best distance, pull the trigger, and read the temp.  You can pull the trigger and hold it, move around the target, and the max temperature it senses, will be displayed just below the main temp reading.--------------------------------------There is no on/off button.  Pulling the trigger to take a reading turns it on, and after about 1 minute it automatically shuts off. Simple--------------------------------------There are a few other identical units out there. Some with yellow handles, some red, and this one blue.  All the same.--------------------------------------Overall, I'm very impressed with this thing.  I normally review LED flashlights, and wanted one of these to measure the heat from the head of a high powered flashlight, and this works very well for that purpose.  There are tons of other uses for this as well.Any questions, feel free to post a comment, I will gladly answer.

Please note that while I am a huge fan of Meguiar's products, I made sure to do my research first before jumping the gun on purchasing this sealant. I also tested this product on my daily driver on all panels as well as on my painted aluminum alloy wheels.To be frank, it isn't the best smelling thing in the world. It smelled like toxic waste and kind of reminded me of those bottles of Ooze that Ivan Ooze used to brainwash people in that Power Rangers movie. As far as value and results are concerned, it practically turns your paint into glass. It leaves a very smooth finish, and it brings out the depth in darker paints. You don't have to take my word for it, just look at some of the reviews on here. This product in general is also highly recommended by several respected professional detailers on car forums. Not to mention, this product is relatively cheap compared to the more expensive sealants out there that work just as well if not worse. I attached a picture of my car for proof. Its the metallic gray 2017 Escape on the left! :)Contrary to what some of the reviewers are saying, this product is relatively easy to apply. You just need to be patient and apply this stuff thinly and work panel by panel. Don't apply an excessive amount of pressure either. Use a clean microfiber applicator and make sure that your paint is clean and properly prepped. You might need to lubricate the applicator with QD or Spray Wax. Please don't be lazy and DO NOT apply this on a dirty car. For best results, apply this indoors in a clean garage safe from contaminants. As for drying time, the longer you leave it on before buffing the better! I had to use my car the same day so I only left it on for about 30 minutes before buffing it off and applying a second coat and leaving it for 10 minutes and buffing it off again.

Not sure why this doesn't come with you Jeep. Glad to have a little protection cause my paint was starting to wear cause that is where people rest their foot there when the doors are off. Installation was simple, clean with provided alcohol wipe and 3m tape it down. Done!Fit my 2015 Jeep Wrangler 2 door no issues. Yes I bought the 4 door one cause I couldn't find one other than the 4 door. Who cares, it works and I'm happy. Does not affect stock doors or my half doors.

These are great. Amazed at the light output. A custom set of reverse mounted offroad lights would make more light but these are so good I'm not going to bother. I had Silver Stars in before and the difference is night and day, literally!I've had them in 6 weeks and leave for work early every day in the dark and no longer curse my tinted windows.

Cover seems very well-made. The tiedown straps took a little bit of figuring, but seem to work well once you get the hang of it. The fit was pretty tight on my Jayco 10X  with air conditioner, but I knew it might be and opted for a tighter fit as opposed to looserI slit foam plumbing pipe insulation for corner protection to avoid where in tear through, and thus far all seems well. UV rays in the Texas summer will be the ultimate test for long-term durability

Too short to lock pin on 2017 Tundra hitch. See pictures. Black one is the cocoweb (what kind of name is that?) and is too short. You can also see the lock pin itself is noticably thinner in diameter than the old one. I can't remember where I bought the old one. The black one also had scuffs and chips in the paint. Quality control must be an issue.

Excellent drop light that provides nearly 360 degrees of light.  This is much better than any LED light that I've used or seen.  Soft foam hooks on each end make attachment to the hood, trunk or roof of most vehicles easy.  Packaging was robust, so I had no issues with broken bulbs.  Excellent addition to any garage.

Have been using since Aug 2017. I use it at least 3 days out of every month, on quads, garden tractor, RV trailer batteries and the vehicles. I was worried about the high charging voltage when I first got it, but a quick call to MFG on a Saturday(left msg) got me a return call in 1 hour. The high voltage is only right at the end of the charge and is low amps, must be the conditioning part. It has worked flawless and does a better job than my other smart charger which is 12 year old.

Wouldnt use this for those 0 degree days but for the days its a bit chilly it helps to keep the cold out a bit.If you're just looking for protection from bugs and rocks this thing works perfect too. Not too tight not too loose and no need to adjust and keep tightening like you would on a normal bandana.

I LOVE this thing so much. It was actually fairly simple to install, with the only hard part being the 1-1/4" hole I had to drill out, but other than that, it took me around 30 minutes I wanna say to install this. I have a 04' GMC Envoy with the 4.2L I6 engine. And it fit perfectly. The thing that put a huge smile on my face was when you gave it gas. The beautiful roar that came from the engine was just amazing. I definitely felt a performance gain and it makes your vehicle a lot louder.. It sounds SO good, I can't even explain it. I'd definitely recommend this for your vehicle, you seriously won't regret it at all!

If you're reading this, you are probably comparing different brands of bed covers and deciding whether it's okay to buy this "cheap" cover as opposed to the more well-known brands, which cost 2-4x the price.  I just installed this on my 2015 Tacoma so can share some comments/thoughts:- Fit & Finish:  It looks good on the truck, matches well with the trim.  Material seems thick enough and the ~1-year reviews I've read are promising. I imagine this is basically the same material/process used on the more expensive ones.  There is a slight  upward bow in the cross-bars which are intended to stop water/snow from pooling in the middle of the cover.  Immediately after install there are some wavy bits on the side of the bed where the pieces fold.  These may straighten out as it sits in the sun and settles.  The nuts & bolts seem to be of good enough quality, lock washers are used where needed, etc.  No complaints here, and I am the type of person to complain about these things.- Installation:  Like several other reviews suggested, I didn't read the instructions - it is pretty straightforward.  It took me about 30-40 minutes to unpack and get everything lined up and bolted down.  2 people is helpful but definitely not required.  No tools required other than a knife/scissors to cut the weather stripping to length and a philips screwdriver if you want to move the tie-down clips on the cover.  There are a few very small gaps which could maybe let a few drops of water in if you're driving through a heavy rainstorm at highway speeds.  I am content with how well it seals.- Install specifics/advice:  Clean off the front (cab) side of the bed liner well before you apply the weather stripping.  To line up the cab-side brackets I just laid down in the truck bed so I could see everything.  Once you have it on straight and the brackets are in place you can fold the cover up for final tightening. The tailgate side can be done with everything in place.  Don't forget to tighten the set screws on the aluminum brackets, but not too tight since it could strip the threads.  Before tightening down the rear brackets I re-installed 2 of the factory cargo tie-downs between the front and rear brackets - just in case I need to tie down something large with the cover open. The attachment hardware on the cover is adjustable, and I moved the rear clips inward 1 slot so they clip in at a straighter angle.  If you're doing this on the same truck with the cargo rails, I would recommend doing this.  Just need to remove a philips screw and move the clips inward 1 slot.  I'm including a picture of this so you can see what I'm talking about.- Road worthiness:  I bought this for an upcoming road trip so we can keep rain & snow off our cargo.  We will be driving about 3000 miles from Texas through the midwest in winter.  Will update after the trip if there are any problems but it seems solid.Overall this is exactly what I expected.  It doesn't look "cheap" and I am content with the weather sealing,  hardware attachment, etc.  I haven't directly compared to the more expensive options but I can't imagine how another brand would be *so* much better it's worth 4x the price.

Fits perfectly on my 2016 Ford XLT. I was a bit worried about the install after reading other reviews but as long as you order correctly for flares or no-flares then you should be good to go as I was. When I pulled them out of the box one guard was bent along the side - there was no damage to the box and I thought I was going to have to return them. I let both guards sit out in the direct sunlight for about an hour and I was able to smooth out the bend and they fit perfectly in the wheel well. All holes matched up and the screws & clips worked as designed. Took about 40 minutes to install. They look great - highly recommend these for any truck.

I off road a lot. I use my winch when I got out to pull my buddies out or move trees. If you look at the picture that was my old winch roller. I destroyed it after a year. But I've used this new one for about 6-8 months now and it's still brand new. It looks just like they day I got it. It still rolls after all the mud and salt of New England. It's has never stopped rolling and it's been beat by everything. Great product that I would stand behind.

While the design and concept are a great idea the execution is not.These are made from a simple plastic that you would find covering a cell phone right our of the box. The adhesive is spot on in that it does stick right away and very well to the clean surface. However as sun and head even here in a spring like day over the course of a week has proven otherwise.Air bubbles appear and they are starting to collect dust under them from where water has worked its way inside. Oh and now they are a bit sharp to the touch of the back of your hand as the plastic has hardened in places. Now too they are pealing off and the plastic has become brittle and broken.  As you can see in the pictures the 4 door handles of a 2010 Rav 4 gave me four chances to get it. I installed them as I would most window treatments, as I did my 3M door jams savers.If these were made from a different polymer then they would be a better product. Over all when they finally wear off I will not be getting new ones. Oh and there are only PIC-TO-GRAMS for the installation...that is unless you can read Japanese.

Purchased a month ago and just got on trailer today. Cover seems durable,looks great and it was a nice fit on my 19'6" 2017 Salem 171RBXL. It went on fairly easy with 2 ppl. Went on the roof and pulled from door side after covering any and all things like gutter spouts and corners that may catch in the wind. The fit is very snug with a good strapping system tho there is a little bunching in the front due to our rounded front end. We just got it on in time as we are having gusty winds for the next few days and the weather forecast is calling for 10-20 inches of snow. We are right off of Lake Ontario so this is are normal winter coming and I am curious to see how this cover holds up as we get close to 200 inch total snow for the season. I guess I will get a good look in the next few days but I feel good so far. Will update in future... UPDATE: So we took the cover off yesterday after a normal winter for us and tho we had some very windy day this cover came through with no issues at all. The trailer looks great....

Do not buy this product. It fits worst than ill dentures! There's all kind of gaps between fenders and these plastic pieces. The seller pulled these out and will try to sell under a different name. Be aware and save your money! I learned it the hard way and had these professionally painted and installed. I'll just have to sell the truck now.

Installed on my 2002 Chevy Tahoe and it looks really good!  The in-channel model looks much cleaner than the kind that tapes onto the outside of the vehicle.  I particularly like how these ones don't seem to stick out as much as others that I've seen.  I think it adds to that clean and sleek look without seeming out of place.I installed all 4 windows in about 30 minutes.My only complaint is that there were some scuff marks on the product that I didn't notice until I was installing them.

Works fine with my 2017 Suzuki RV200. The unit has three different settings for different ignition systems. I had to change the unit to the second setting as it was reading half of the actual RPM. I mounted on the handle bars for easy viewing. Only time will tell how long it will last. I don't ride in the rain much and I will cover it when washing my bike just to be safe.

Like some other reviewers, mine (a Lumax LX-1152) leaks from the top. Like almost every fitting. I'm using Mobil One Synthetic Grease, and it's easy to tell, because that red stuff really stands out as it comes out of every part of the top of the gun.It pumped grease up into the suspension fittings on my truck nicely - no issues getting it on the fittings.Other than the outrageous leaking, I would like the gun - everything feels like it's well made. Apparently it's just not.

I bought these for my 2003 honda odyssey. They fit well, and install quickly and easily. When installing them make sure you put the channel without tape ( at the good end of the visor) into the trim between the channel and the window or it won't fit properly.I have two complaints that keep me from rating this product five stars, one minor and one to do with the function. The first is I dislike branded aftermarket products, this has white AVS lettering on the visor, I think it detracts from the overall look of the product.The second complaint i have is less superficial. The angle of the visor doesn't follow the window perfectly so when they are open part of the window is covered by these and part is still out, the picture from the interior of the van shows this, but it is a little hard to seeOverall they are a good option if you don't care or aren't OCD like me, however i think if I could do it over I would not buy these and perhaps try the weathertek ones, however those cost more.

This is the 4th curt hitch I bought online, and 3rd I've installed.  This by far was the most challenging one I've done to date however it's still not too difficult.  Then again I've designed cars, restored a car, and launched a car from the production factory.  This most important thing is to go slow when opening up the clips to take off the bumper.  I think Curt's instructions are pretty horrible, not close to specific enough, and overall poor.If you have mud flaps on your car it's much easier to take the tires off, I took mine off and put the back on jackstands so I had lots of room to work.Also I have an SE model and it has some plastic on the bottom of the bumper, it was very close to get the bumper remounted and I ended up taking off the plastic, after I reinstalled the bumper cover I put the bottom plastic piece back on.  However it is really high up and looks great.Pro's:CheapGood QuailityDoes it's jobI like the greater ground clearance, I also put a curt hitch on the previous VW Sportwagon, this one is at least 4 inches higher.Con'sPoor packaging, arrived with a massive hole in the boxSpecs are off and I had to dremel one of the holes to get it to mount, used on a 2016 sport wagon that has not been in any accidentsPoor instructionsInstallation is a little challenging, if you can't do it yourself expensive(I had a quote of 300 for labor alone)

I purchased three of the covers to install on my Redwood 36RL.  The instructions were not clear on how to install the covers on max fans in which you have no access to the inside flange of the fan lip.  I noticed where sheet metal screws were included in the hardware bag so I used them to attach the clips.  They have not blew off yet:)!

I had really high hopes for these drl bars. Upon receipt, the bars looked good although felt pretty cheaply made. This wasn't a huge deal as when I tested them before installing they were bright and beautiful. With the cost being low, I could look past the cheap quality. Not any more. The other downside was the ridiculously short wire attached, not good for anything.Tomorrow will mark 1 month since I installed these on my truck, and I'm disappointed to report that most of the LED's are no longer working. See the picture. I love OPT7 LED headlights, and I have all OPT7 leds on my truck, but this was a huge disappointment. I don't have the packaging to return them, but I would steer clear of this item. Install took way too long to have them bug out in a month.

These are badass! Very bright, crispy clear 6k white, turn on with only a few second warmup time. The build quality is top notch, the ballsts are very nice and the mounting bracket option was put to good use. I used to have e 55watt 6k HID from Apex (another seller on Amazon) I got these Innovited ones and wow does craftsmanship and quality shine here! Very bright and can see everything, it's a comforting natural white, not the annoying to the eyes LED white with blue tint. I use mine in projector low beams and projector fog lights so 4 55watt 6k HIDs and Im normally the most litup car on the road. I do believe if you only have low beams (2 ballsts) the warmup time is almost instantly as 2 vs 4 requires much less power, the more you have the longer it takes to build that energy up into the ballasts hence (Warm up time). When testing these just 1 ballast plugged in instantly went to full power no warmup time, with 2 it was 1 or 2 seconds of warmup then full powerful. With 4 55 watt ballasts that's alot of power and it took 3 to 5 seconds which is still very quick considering my old ones took over 15 seconds. Very good job here Innovited, I'm all about the lights and you nailed it!

Fits gen 3 Integra. I had to use a lubricant, such as WD-40, on the 14mm screw to get the filter to fit properly. The Mahle filter I got was silver in color, not black. No noticeable effect on fuel economy.Update: As the the title says, this filter became defective, and I've noticed fumes in cabin as well, and a drop in fuel economy. I will consider getting another one, and see how that goes. I've attached an image of the leakage.

I am reviewing two motorcycle covers.  This one, and this one&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Tokept-Universal-Black-amp-Red-WATERPROOF-SUN-UV-Motorcycle-cover-XXL-104-quot-Fit-to-Honda-Victory-Kawasaki-Yamaha-Suzuki-Harley-Davidson/dp/B01CFVAEAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tokept Universal Black & Red WATERPROOF SUN UV Motorcycle cover (XXL) 104" Fit to Honda Victory Kawasaki Yamaha Suzuki Harley Davidson</a>.  The manufacturer sent them to me in exchange for an honest review.I ride a 2007 Harley Davidson Screamin' Eagle Road King.  Overall length is 93.5, according to Harley's site.  My husband rides a 2003 Harley Davidson Fat Boy (it's got a Road King front end, but I don't think that added much, if any, to the length).  According to Harley, its length is 94.3".  I have attached photos of each bike, wearing each cover, and also without a cover.  Yeah, I like my bling.  :)Both of these covers are lightweight nylon and are very easy to roll up and store in your bag.  I could see using them to keep the dew off on an overnight camping trip or to keep dust off during off-season months (I live in California, so we don't have many, but I know that friends in snow-country have a pretty short riding season).  The clamps are well-attached, and easy to open and close (really, they aren't totally necessary, but do lock the cover on well, which would be good in case of wind).I had some issues with fitment.  As you can see from the photos, they didn't quite cover like the photos show.  Our bikes are 10" shorter than the max on the ad, and it is my guess that the manufacturer meant that the overall length of the cover is 104", not the bike max length.I only marked it down one star for this, because we do use windscreens, I have aftermarket 17" apes, and the product still protects, even if it's not fully covered.While we were in escrow for our house, we lived in our 5th wheel in a KOA campground, and parked our cars and bikes outdoors.  I sure wish I'd had these covers then.  We constantly battled dust as cars filtered in and out.So, for ease of use, ease of storage, and the protection that this cover offers, I give it 4 stars.  I wish it was longer...that's my only wish for this.  The rest is all peachy.I have no clue why Amazon uploaded my pictures this way (some upside-down, some sideways, some right-side up).  I tried fixing it from the original review site, but will try again once they are uploaded.

I ordered these for my 1982 Yamaha YZ 125 38mm 11.8 travel forks on my vintage mx bike. There was mixed information about these fitting my forks so I ordered them to check out in hopes they would work and indeed they fit but but won't actually function for this use.They are well made of thick material but are designed to fit much smaller, shorter travel bikes than the description would lead you to believe. The inner baffles of the accordion sections are barley 38mm ID especially when extended to near 11 inches, this does not allow the boots to collapse over the top of the slider when the fork is bottomed out like the original boots would have, effectively stopping the fork approx 3.5" short of full travel assuming there is zero space between the top of the fork and the lower triple clamp as there is in my case. The stanchion opening is pretty small but they did manage to go on but were stretched very tight.Here is my humble description for fitment of these boots30-38 mm stanchion (chrome upper tube) diameter55-59 mm slider tube (lower tube) diameter appox 7.5? inch travel fork with no more than about 11" of showing stanchion at full extension and no less than 3.5" of stanchion tube showing between top of slider and lower triple clamp with fork fully bottomed.I hope this helps people determine the fitment of these, and as I said they look well made and durable. I am going to order the larger 69 series boots or go with the old school rubber scrapers,

This was purchased for a 2015 Grand Caravan and while the quality and fit are very good, the 1st picture does not truly represent the actual deflector.  The picture shows a deflector that looks to extend over the headlamps.  In reality it does not.  It protects the edge of the hood between the headlamps only as shown in the second picture.  In summary, if you are confused as to which picture actually depicts the deflector you order it is the one in the attached photo.

(I am raising this up to 4 stars from one) I finally got a sales rep that was kind and helpful, but this product is merely okay. I originally dropped this to one star. I would give zero stars for the B&M sales reps who cannot say what this fits, nor do they even have have ANY dimensions. The instructions PDF has the wrong size parts listed on it! THANKS JERKS! Learn how bolts are measured or send out the right stuff! The heads and caps do not count as part of the length!  I had dropped this to one star. B&M's PDF instructions do not even have the right size hardware listed. I took them at their word it had 16 M8-1.25 x 30 mm bolts. The bolts are 25 mm, and are still a tad long for a 4R60M unless you use extra washers. Now I have $50 of non-returnable anodized cap screws, and a car that won't move for another 4 days. THANKS! I will probably buy Huges, but I will probably NOT be dealing with B&M  parts for any pans again any time soon. Other issues: No port for temp gauge. Clearance to exhaust, rock plates, and cross member is workable, but tight. Gasket quality is below average for a $200+ pan. I still had to use 22 mm cap bolts for the installation. 30 mm barely goes into the second piece of casting, and 22 is much much closer to the depth of the stock pan bolts. The bolts that came with the pan were 25mm, not 30mm. They don't even send out what they say they will in the PDF. On the plus side, you can remove this pan without removing the cross member, and it has a drain plug. On the minus side, these are hard to clean, the magnet is small, and the hardware that comes with these is inconsistent. The technical help is also inconsistent. Use the cork gasket or get a Fel Pro fiber composite. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE A RUBBER GASKET! I am happy I can remove this pan without dropping the cross member, and change the filter. B&M did NOT include the filter clip, and the bolts were not the size stated in the PDF.

Great product, if you follow the instructions! Works fantastic!. the amount that comes with the kit is plenty, I applied 5 coats to each caliper and I could not give more because the paint at that point in time was too thick (I took my time to make sure I got it right) I removed the brake pads and supports and made the whole job a lot easier!

It's the best wax I've ever used, hands down. Let it warm up in the sun while you're detailing your car so it flows really smoothly. Don't overdo it-- four drops on a pad is good enough for the whole hood. The beading is insane too. I drive through the rain on the way back home from work and by the time I get home, my car looks almost dry.Picture above is my car with Collinite applied; the picture below that is my uncle's car, which only goes through a standard automated car wash once a month.

this product works well. it is almost identical to dynamat extreme, yet is less expensive. the only diffrence being the aluminum is slightly thinner, but is still great quality. after much research i cant find what the adhesive is, but it is almost certainly a high percent butyl. the odor from it is so so faint its negligable. so its a great alternative to the name brands. will purchase more. and in fact it lays and rolls down better than dynamat. only took away a star because 3 dollars a square foot is still high for what it is.

Good looking, high-quality, durable feeling plain black mud guards.  No frills, look like stock/custom fit, and the black plastic is decent match to the truck's plastic body molding. Easy install with no drilling required, good instructions - company install videos also on youtube. They even come with some small clear stickers to protect the outside of truck paint finish from scuffs if you decide to remove them down the road. Very pleased with this purchase.

Installed in a 94 K1500. I noticed that the delay was going away on my wipers. No more than 3 seconds on full delay. So I thought I would give this a try and it works great. I know have some delay to my wipers again, long end 15-20 seconds. Turely this is any easy thing to change; disconnect wire/plug, 3 torx screws(you don't even need to remove the outer 2 just loosen them if you like the cover slips off of them), pop of cover and out comes the board, new board in, cover & screws and plug connector back in & done!Also you may notice that you old board may have way more connections and things on the board than this new one, must have up dated this with newer electronics?

The light arrived and appeared to be solidly built.  Due to the many reviews of condensation getting into the light, I disassembled it prior to mounting it on the truck.  It is a time consuming project with all the small allen bolts that hold the lens of the light on.  I removed that, and there is a small rubber o-ring that seals the front of the light which in my case was torn at one end which would have led to water getting into the light.  I used silicon sealant and put a little bit under the rubber seal, replaced the seal and put a little on top of it before replacing the lens and the cover.  Once it was sealed up, I mounted it on the truck and it has been fine even dealing with rain/snow/sleet.The L mounting brackets are easy and work well.  They have notches so that you can adjust the light to tilt forward and back.  If it is mounted anything but straight ahead, the cooling fins will cause it to whistle.  This can be cured by getting some of the rubber trim that is meant to protect the edges of your doors and put that on the fins.I installed it using an SPDT relay and installation was simple.  The pictures attached are with the low beam headlights only and then the low beams plus the light bar.  The flood light throws a lot off to the sides as it is intended to, and on roads with trees on either side, it is much easier to see how much light it puts out.  Which helps with seeing the critters that might want to jump out in front of you.

These rims look great on my 07 H3. I was surprised at how much better they made the truck look. Wish I would have bought them years ago. I'm running the 18x9 rims with 285/65/r18 bfg ko2's. Has plenty of room for the tires and fills out the wheel wells better. Don't hesitate buy them you will love the look they give.  Hope the pics help with your decision.

The Good:-Well made...I thought it was going to be plastic or something but its metal, comes with jewelry(covers for the screw heads)  and it very well packaged-All crystals are mounted, not just glued on-It really sparkles (check the pics of it installed on a Jeep Grand Cherokee )-Fits a standard US plate with no issues-The mounting hardware is better then OEM in my opinion. Screws went in without any issues and caps snapped on.Other Thoughts:-Time will tell how this plate holds up...my initial worry is that the stones will vibrate loose and fall out periodically...They seem to be holding on fine after a week of driving-I only used the top 2 holes because the jeep did not have bottom holes for plateThe Bottom Line:If you have a nice ride or just want to your plate to sparkle then this plate is for you. I'm happy that its not just plastic with jeep stones glued on. This should hold up for a while. Note: I received this product at a discount; my opinions are always honest and unbiased. Hope this helps.

Purchased these and went to install them on my 2014 JKU, the holes in the grab handles are drilled at slightly the wrong angle. I had to apply a lot of force on the handle to try and get the holes aligned, however they still wouldn't go on and I didn't want to risk snapping the bolt off in the pillar or stripping the threads.I added a picture with some lines on it to show my problem. The green lines indicate where the bolts should go, the red line shows where the top hole on the handle actually goes.Returned.

Fit my 98 xj no problems. Paired with Performance Friction 0477.20 Carbon Metallic Brake Pads. After a day of breaking in I have a huge improvement in stopping power. Rotors are coated inside venting and outside on none breaking surfaces. Should work great to keep the venting from rusting and plugging up.  Update.. After 20k miles one rotor material is separating and brakes are pulsing. Going to o have to replace these for safety reasons. Will not but again.

These hood struts are well built and came with everything needed to complete installation. Took about 30 minutes to install on my 2017 GT. I had to make the hole in the battery cover slightly bigger than the hole tool max diameter. Requires very little force to break resistance during closing. Neutral point is about 20 degrees hood opening. Only minor issue, the driver side hood bracket is slightly turned, due to the OEM angled bracket. May need to grind away some material on either the Redline bracket or OEM to achieve a parallel fit. The hood support rod is no longer useful as the hood opens further with these.

Everything from the pump to the motor to the handle to the hose to the alligator clips is decent quality for the price. I wouldn't say the unit is "quiet", but it does sound more refined than those throw-away compressors that overheat and burn up the first time you use them. It is definitely fast - takes just a few minutes to air up a typical tire. The other cheap, portable compressors I've had took 10x as long.

Installed yesterday on our 2017 RAM 1500 Bighorn Quad Cab.  We purchased these on other recommendations here and I could not be happier.  Knowing the packaging quirks and to swap one of the driver brackets for front passenger (and vice versa), the install took less than two hours.  Everything was straightforward and, after reading the instructions before starting, everything was clear and concise.  They've held up quite well for one day of use.  They look great and make a world of difference for ease of access!  Included is before and after shots.

I have done springs many ways over the years, with and without spring compressors, I even manage to get some springs for a 455 big block with AC springs into my parents 1971 Buick with a small-block and no ac :)  ....I did that one without a compressor !...anyway, the tool is a bit aggravating if you're trying not to scratch the paint on the springs and control arms....you kind of have to find your inner octopus to get everything lined up and properly seated but one you have it down, it goes pretty smooth. I was was able to cut my install time in half from one side to the next on my 69 Olds.  Better have a 1-1/4 " wrench handy cuz there's no using an impact on this if you start the screw in the wrong spot ( I kind preferred turning by hand since its less violent)  Close your eyes and hope the spring Q/C guy was awake while you're clamping up those coils !!  I wasn't worried about the tool, its made in THE USA !!  (even the bearing) I was more afraid of finding that one bad coil spring....that hard way !  Expensive but worth the investment.I had pictures ....how do I post those ?

Worked perfectly and appears more robust than the factory Toyota ones that were bent on my 4x4 limited 4Runner. Need 18mm and 17mm socket to install these along with a 19mm open end wrench to hold keep the joint from spinning.  Will need a 17mm socket, 17mm ratcheting box wrench, 14mm socket, and possibly a 5mm Allen key to remove original sway bar link.Less than 5 minutes to install per side.

This intake improves the throttle response and give a nice boost in power at around 4-6k RPM. It works well, but its not going to drastically increase horsepower or torque.Overall, I am very satisfied with the build quality and the improved throttle response.Note: This intake does not have a polished finish, but rather painted silver. Personally, I prefer the way the silver one looks.Great buy.

Bought the "Kit" that contains two bottles. Very glad I did. Just finished doing a complete flush of the brake lines on a 25 year old car and these were the second-best purchase I made to help make the job manageable. (The first was the Power Bleeder and appropriate reservoir cap, also from Motive).These catch bottles have a very nice conforming hose that was easy to push onto the bleeder valve and stayed on without any special attention other than watching it to be sure. The hose was clear enough to see any bubbles, and the bottle is clear enough too. See photos. The really nice thing about having the two bottles was that when it looked like all the old fluid had been flushed from a line, I could unscrew the bottle and put the other one on to capture the tail-end of the fluid. Then I could check the fluid color and particles to see that the purge was good. The air vent on the bottle is also convenient for holding the end of the hose once you're done with a wheel (and seals it off so it doesn't spill - unless you're rough with it of course). They may seem a bit pricey, but they are well worth it !

I've been off-roading for more than four decades. Bikes, buggies and now, a 4x4. Never really thought I needed a winch until I got the 4X4, but since my Trooper weighs in at around 4,500 pounds, I knew there was no way I could get out of a "sticky" situation without a winch. I run in sand at Hatteras, hills and woods at Wind Rock and make the occasional trip to CO to explore old mining trails and hunt for ghost towns. And I always travel alone. So, one of my first purchases for the Trooper was an ARB bullbar and a Warn M8000. That was in 2002. Oddly, since then, I haven't had a desperate need for a winch. Oh, there have been numerous times when I have had to clear a large branch or tree from the trail, but I've never been stuck, so I never had a chance to put the M8000 to the test.Then, this Spring, I had a 70', 18" diameter black pine break in a windstorm and fall into the lake near my boat dock where we live. After failing to get TVA to remove it (it was on their easement), I decided to see if the Trooper, ARB bullbar and Warn winch were up to the task. The tree was in about 3-5 feet of water and would have to be lifted about 8' to get it up into my yard where I could cut it up with a chainsaw. I had no idea what the tree weighed, so to aid in the lifting and increase the pulling power, I strapped a snatch block onto another standing tree as high as I could reach in an attempt to pull the trunk of the tree in the water up onto the embankment. I paid out about half the wire rope (50') to gain a little mechanical advantage. The tree moved freely as I oriented it perpendicular to the shore, but eventually snagged on the rip-rap on the shoreline. Not sure if I would overtax the M8000, I continued the pull, stopping occasionally to allow it to cool.The winch struggled with the pull, but managed to coax the tree trunk up and onto the embankment. Then, I attached the snatch block to a tree some 60 feet away and positioned the Trooper about another 30' or so from the snatch block at about a 45 degree angle. When I started the pull, the tree moved only a few feet further into my yard before the winch started pulling the Trooper across the grass towards the snatch block. I blocked all four wheels and tried again. No dice. The tree was too heavy (but the winch, although it was clearly struggling, pulled on). Finally, I backed the Trooper up to another tree and wrapped a strap around it and hooked both ends over the tow hook on the back. When I began to pull, there was so much force that I actually was pretty sure something was going to give - the winch, the bumper, maybe even the frame of the truck. The winch was clearly maxed out and turned slowly. But the tree moved. I took my time and allowed the winch to cool after about each 1 1/2 - 2 minute pull. It took maybe 1/2 an hour, but the tree eventually all ended up in the yard where I could saw it up.The winch never failed (nor did the bull bar or the frame of the Trooper) and it saved me nearly the cost of purchase that day alone. Now, when I'm on the trail, I have full confidence that I can deal with almost any extrication issue that comes along. Well done, Warn!

Works good. Make sure you shake it up really well and that it is warm. If not, it will not spray out smooth and have globs here and there. One can I got seemed to be leaking a bit so it dripped on what I was spraying. Maybe I'll get a replacement if the company see's this. I'll get cans locally next time anyway.

These are the only feasible solution on a 2015 Valkyrie and they work great. I have many friends who have them on 2014/2015 GL1800C  VALKYRIES.They were easy to install.  I did have an issue where one would spring considerably lower than the other and I'm hoping I can adjust it.  I also had to use a tap & die kit to re-cut the threading when bolting the extension rods on.  I could not get the screws to thread in from either side.I gave them 4 stars because there was some minor issues I had to overcome while installing that should not have been there and others might not have the resources to address them. They sure look good on my valkyrie.It is critical that the cans inside the main housing match so that the peak of one cam  fits  into the valley of the other.  If they get out of alignment, the peg will not "lock" when downward pressure  is applied, no matter how right you tighten the main bolt.

Surely THE highest quality halogen bulbs I have ever used on any vehicle. Very bright, even and powerful beam. I will say, the whole XTREME WHITE name is a bit decieving, because they surely weren't close to white in my Foresters reflector housings. Took a star for that reason. However, they were definitely less dull looking than any other halogens I have ever used. Certainly increased visibility. Well packaged, nice looking bulbs physically and performance wise. If you are looking for an HID or LED style white color.. this is not it - but PIAA makes some of the best bulbs in the world and these bulbs live up to their brand name very well. *SEE PHOTOS IN REVIEW :: First pic/before with both regular cheap sylvania halogens, the second picture is the PIAA on the left of picture (passengers side), and the third picture is both PIAA Xtreme white bulbs.

Before I begin I will stated my goal was to have a multi-purpose street/track car (in that order).  However, the more I drive on the track the more I realize that is really not possible.  Car:  2012 Subaru WRX STi @ estimated 300WHP.  These EBC Yellows Lasted ~16, 20-minute session on R-Compound tires before burning up like the shuttle craft on re-entry. Will not buy again for track use.  That said, they did not fade before crumbling into sand.Rotor temperature was in excess of 1200F which is not outside of the heat range of these pads, from what I can tell.  However, it appears EBC doesn't actually publish the heat range?

EDIT:  To be honest, I found out after a good bit of digging that if you let your free trial or subscription run out, there is a $35 reactivation fee.  Which is what I let happen.  I tried to subscribe the day the free trial ended.  But something I think is dirty is the fact that on your subscription end date, the subscription ends at 12:00 AM, not at 11:59 PM like everything else in life.  So, say your end date is 2/17, your subscription would end at midnight on 2/16.  Just so you know...  The one star review stays due to this not being worth any extra money over the already high price and the fact that their remote start installed in my wifes 2015 Camry is having issues as well.  We found that the headlights no longer work at all on the auto setting (no wires were cut or tapped into as I had purchased their "T-Harness").  I contacted tech support (after 30 minutes on hold) to be told they haven't heard of that and requested I send in more information.  They requested the serial and firmware numbers from the device (I had to take the dash apart on the car again to get them) and the VIN number from the car.  I emailed them as requested and received a receipt that the email had been read.  Never heard from them.  Sent the email again with the information (read receipt received again) and never heard from them.  Josh Woodie is the tech that has been ignoring the email he requested.  Anyways, bad experience all around from a bad company.  This was a Christmas present for my wife and it has been nothing but a headache.Original Review:Works fine. Problem is with the subscription service. I was well aware of the cost for the basic, premium, and business subscriptions before I purchased this. What I was not aware of was an additional $35 "activation fee" that is not disclosed anywhere I can find. Here's the kicker though, which really irritates me. They give you a free 30 trial (no activation fee for this by the way), so by the time your free trial is up, so is your return period when you find out about the additional fee. My device is already activated, why is there an activation fee just to purchase a subscription??? This is very low down, dirty, greedy business practice. I've already removed it from my wifes car and will be calling Amazon to see if I can still return it. Next step will be contacting the BBB. Third step will be filing a dispute for the cost of it with my credit card company. I attached a screenshot of the charge.

Fits my 2017 Toyota Tacoma Off-Road Double-Cab Short-Bed. Material made of strong, durable material. Keeps cargo from sliding and protects the bed from scratches. Cut outs at the end leave space for d-rings. Small rubber material on the bottom of the mat to keep it from sliding and allows water to filter out.Only downside was the item came in very dirty. Had to clean it up before installing.Overall a great product and a must have for any Tacoma owner.

One of my favorite CG products, really adds depth to my Brilliant Black Crystal. Repels water really well on it's own, but even better with Butter Wet Wax or V07 on top. Does a good job of hiding microscratches (not as good as a polish, but not bad for a sealant). Easy to apply and buff out, but you will need quite a few buff towels since they clog up with residue quickly.

Not for 2004 Silverado with the non-threaded screw on type cap. If the one you're replacing has the screw threads on the side of the cap this is probably the right one. Mine has two points on the side that screw my cap into the plug. See the picture I posted and compare yours to that before you order. This cap did screw into the plug but the connecting cable didn't fit into the hole on the fuel door the old one came out of so I returned it. The cap I needed was the GT289. Still, this is a high quality ACDelco part.

What can I say? There was no way I was going to be able to swap out the engine mount on my Buick LeSabre without this. I'm so glad I bought this. I was tugging on the wrench to the point where it would be unwise to continue. I soaked the nuts & bolts overnight in the Kroil and then by next morning, the frozen hardware came off nice and easy. I was pretty glad it worked out; I was ready to give it up. I'm going to recommend this product to anybody who faces a similar conundrum. Thumbs up.

I had to send the first one back because the seams were not flush.  Unfortunately, the second one was the same.  The inner seam on the front and back cause the vinyl to be jagged where the seam joins.  So when you let the wheel spin or articulate the steering wheel, it's very annoying.  It is not going to cut you, but it is damn annoying.  See the pictures for what I am referring to.

For what it is it does alright. I have a 2 car garage. My wifes 340i and my SS are safe from the pollen dust and rain, but this leaves my daily out in the open. I have trees in my driveway and leave a ton of pollen dust and sap on whatever is parked underneath. This cover protects my Honda CRV from both of those aswell as reflects the sun. For $30 you cant go wrong. It light wieght and easy to throw on and take off.Like other have said THIS DOES NOT COME WITH THE LOCK AS ADVERTISED.I feel that this will last all spring and summer long.

Solid construction, all aluminum with stainless steel hardware.  I intend on mounting these on the window frame of a 13 Jeep JK and needed brakets.  The brackets that come in the box will be useful in mounting but need a unique bracket to mount to frame.  Lights are Nilight 6.5" 36w LED also available on Amazon.  I used silicon between the bracket and the car.  Apply light silicon, then hand tightened the bolts...waited 12 hours for the silicone to cure then tightened the bolts.

I ordered the black ones. Not machine washable as the picture I took of the tag shows. Spot clean & dry in the shade.....Easily snagged, very wrinkled & can't iron nor toss in drier for a few min. to hope they come out a little.  The concept of these is great, but cheap fabric & fit a little shorter & narrower than I'd expected in my 2016 Corolla. I'm glad I didn't pay any more for these! The last seat covers in my car with under 10000 miles didn't make a year. These won't either - if they do I will update my rating. I'm the only person in my car & transport another person once or twice a week so hoped to make a year with something. I'm starting to think of making some on my own with these as a pattern... could use carpet stay strips...

Used on my half doors of my 1994 YJ Jeep.  Look great and very similar to my factory one that I have on another YJ.  Only reason I gave it 4 Stars instead of 5 was that the screws were philips head and not torx and the metal they were made of is kinda soft.  Other than that, a great price for mirrors for your doors!

Worked great.  Had to employ all the usual tricks to remove old ones. My RV (Chevy P30 Chassis Van) has two (2) Upstream O2 Sensors. To remove these FROZEN bears, had to 1/ Run engine 15-min. to heat things up;  2/  Used breaker bar.  3/  After renting AutoZone slotted sockets, finally decided to buy Amazon ABN 3 Piece 3/8" Drive Oxygen Sensor Wrench Socket Set to have handy;  over a two day period, sprayed Sensors (at hex nut) w/ PB Blaster;  4/  Hit Sensor heads w/ hammer to "knock loose" rust softened up by PB Blaster.  All this & they were still BOTH bears to remove.  Ensure you order your UPSTREAM, not downstream, Sensors.  I bought these after CEL came on, AutoZone ran OBDII, came up w/ A/  Coolant Temperature Sensor (replaced that last week, after which CEL went OFF!) and B/ Upstream O2 Sensor.  Glad I replaced all 3 parts, as the old ones all came out dirty.

JUNK!  Let me say that one more time...J-U-N-K!!!!  I just finished REPLACING three WARPED rotors (both fronts and passenger rear) that caused my truck to shake and shimmy when applying the brakes.  I only had 10000 miles on them!  I replaced the driver's rear rotor since the other three were JUNK.  Plus...the passenger rear caliper freezes and wore through a set of pads (see photos) down to the metal backing.  The photos show the rear pads...the ones off of the stuck caliper and the 'good ones' from the driver side.  If you're thinking about buying this JUNK to improve the stopping performance of your truck, just go to your local parts house and buy their 'best' versions...you'll save tons and be happier since they'll last much longer than this JUNK!!!!  Yeah...I'm SORELY disappointed!

Fitment is good. Not sure if the bad ratings here are fitment issues or not checking to see if this is the correct gasket. For my 06 350z touring roadster, it fit fine on the driver side. No issues with the passenger side so I didn't replace that one. Fits fine no leaks when tightened to manufacture specs (mine were in-lbs not foot-lbs). Always read the specs for your specific car, but for the 350z it is not much more than snug.

Front brake hose blew a hole in it while i was coming to a stop to let bikers pass.  Lost all brakes and almost ran them over.  Got out to inspect what happened and found the line has blown in a place that there was no way possible for it to have been rubbed.  Pulled oit visegrips to crimp off the line to drive to my destination and when i sqeazed it the line crused and tore open there too.  These lines are about 2 years old but that's pathetic.

Great bumper.As others have said, it is harder to get the old bumper off than it is to install this one.  I installed a quadratec winch immediately with no problems at all.  Again, the hardest part was making the wiring nice so there was no rubbing...As far as the stock lights, I relocated the fog/driving lights, then walked away from the wiring mostly because there was a bowl game coming on that I wanted to watch, and then I came back a day later.  On my 2010 JKU, I had to take off some of the tape that was installed by the factory, but I was able to pull enough wiring out of the plastic corrugated tubing to reach the new lighting locations.  Both sides reached fine, and the wiring harness zip tied to a reinforcement piece of the bumper just fine.overall, tough looking bumper, and the d-rings are a great touch.I can't wait to add lighting to the tabs that are built in to the bull bar.

Nice finish to these brackets as they compliment my silver 2003 TJ nicely. All hardware was included for install for the exception that i purchased rubber washers to go in between the body and bracket. When installing these, heat is the only way to go IMO. The factory painted bolts are blue locktighted in which makes for a more difficult time. I had a small butane torch laying around and used the closed end side of a wrench to guard the paint on the body. I tried taking the old hardware off before applying heat and started to twist my T40 torx. I wish they would have came with rubber washers for install thus not deserving the 5 stars. Fitment was a touch out of line but did seat well once i fiddled with the bolts.

Bought this one for a trip to Moab. After installation it worked for two days. Then started to blow fuses, I checked wiring, on/off button and finally the light itself. Turned out it is the light that has a short circuit. Tested with multi-meter,  Result is zero resistance which only possible in two cases, one if it is a superconductor which this damn thing is not and two short circuit!!!! Poor built, stay away from this light bar!

I mounted these on my high-slung Vanagon to help older riders get a leg up. Like me, because I am getting older. Had to weld on some spacers and painting due to the Vanagon's stepwell being slanted underneath, but it came out really solid and helpful.

This pump is NOT what is pictured. The impeller has a cheap shield on it. I would like to return it, but Im in a bind and need to get the truck rolling again. Its a China pump. Beware!

Edit,cap didn't even survive a week!Outside ring of cap broke off from the center of the capI don't know if the bottle was under too much pressure when the coolant expanded in the radiator & overflowed (like it's supposed to!),or if the cap didn't like the heat of the coolant (also, it's *supposed to be* hot),but after maybe an hour of use, or less the cap self destructed.I'll post what replacement I end up getting,but I dinged a star off.Original review:So far so good, I put one in an early Jeep that had a closed system & didn't come with an overflow container, and bought a second one for another older vehicle that didn't originally have a bottle.Plastic seems a bit cheap, but flexible and pliable so far.Though it's still warm outside this time of year.I'll update the review if/when there's issues.

They desintegrate after a couple of uses, contacted chemical guys and they won't warranty their products. Their solution? buy another one,even after they have known about their design flaw and have redesigned these. Never again going to buy these. Expect them to not work at all after actually using them arround 4-5 times.

in case my other comment was not posted correctly (from my phone) I absolutely am super happy with these lights!!! My father has graveyard shift and is home usually 3-4am...due to our parking accommodation and his truck (2010 Honda Ridgeline) It's easiest for him to back up our driveway (about 100 or so feet to the back...+/-) Anyway, the old lights (stock) were so dim it was barely visible, now with these LED"s WOW!!! super amazing to see everything around them. Even at his work, his parking area has no light post and he must rely on the trucks' light. now this makes it so much easier to see all vehicles around.(see pictures). =)

So we received this last week just in time for Christmas, and for a little bit the weather did not hold up long enough for us to get it installed in our dodge ram before the snow started flying.  We will be posting a video soon once it's all installed but we are currently landed in installation until the truck gets back from the garage.  However I wanted to stop by and say that these horns are beautifully made.  It also thankfully came with very detailed directions of the do's and dont's of installation.  If you wanted I am sure you could rearrange the horns in an order that you found more appealing as they unscrew easily.  I received this at a discount for my unbiased honest review.  Again a video will be following probably next week.  Also if you have any questions about this product and how satisfied we are please don't hesitate to contact me.

Absolutely love the way it finishes out. I'm not a fan of the "minimal dust" but as far as doing what is says (and even more if you're a skilled technician) it performs great.Detailed a 2014 black Camaro with a high speed polisher and a white foam waffle cutting pad yesterday (the 50th + car I've used this product on) and it performed as expected removing water spots, swirls and 50-70% of the fine to medium scratches.If you know what your doing this product is a great tool in the arsenal, if your new to detailing or your frustrated with trying lots of different stuff the buck stops here... A simple DA (portal cable/griots or the Meguiars) performs very well (I own them all) with different pads...I primarily use foam pads when using this product.

Really solid product and easy installation. The only reason why I give 4 stars instead of 5 is the pins that go into the adapted on the Audi are a little loose which made the lights flicker. Was an easy fix with some electrical tape though.

Excellent backup lights for jeep to supplement custom backup camera. Just connect to white with purple stripe wire going into taillight in Chrysler or Jeep vehicles (or on others just remove taillight lens per second photo and see which wire goes to your reverse bulb) If you have any worries you can do a saddle splice connector so you don't even need to cut any wire. Drill bit was included to make for clean install, per third picture. It's easy anybody can do it if they try!

Extremely easy to install, Very easy to wire them up and I like that they are lit when my regular lights are on and then light up when the accessory is turned on. Great switch, great options for what lights they control and they look great as well.

Pretty good steps, very little flex at 180 pounds, fit the body lines pretty well.  I knocked it a star only because of an issue that required me to fix the bracket.  They could not be installed otherwise, do not let this stop you from considering.I went with the 4 inch model to keep them withing the tire lines.  Im not a fan of the wings that end up hanging past the tire, these fill in perfect.  They do have some adjustability if you wanted but not much.  They went on rather straight forward, but I have installed a few sets that use that wild bracket they came with <--- which is the reason for 4 stars.  The directions are a bit on the useless side.  I you stare at it long enough you will figure it out.The install took me about 30-45 minutes total.  I used a small 18v impact to drive most of the bolts so that saved me tons of time alone.  Once you figure out the crazy bracket setup its goes quick.  I installed with the longer part forward so it matches the cab nicely.The bracket that goes into the body to support the main bracket for the boards is a fight.  You really need 30 fingers to do it easy.  My best advice for the 5 that you have help, if not install the bracket in the body as indicated with the clear washer to hold it still.  Install the large nut and not the lock washer just to hand tighted to hold in place while you install the bolt through the bracket, use a pen <--- yes a pen to line up the nut thats in the body to get the bolt started with its required washers, then remove the giant nut and install the lock washer.  It looks like the front driver bracket has been updated since the review of it not fitting certain trucks.  This one has a few more steps but nothing too hard.I started by laying everything out in piles and where it goes under the truck.  From there I started the battle, the main problem was the brackets you hide in the body have nuts welded on.  2 out of the 6 of these brackets the nut was welded just a tad to far off the predrilled hole,  This caused an issue that required a grinder.  There was no other way to make it work, I had to grind out the bracket to access the nut from the main bracket side.  I came up with 6 extra bolts and washers, these looked as if they were used on the trucks with nuts already in the body, they say this is for the 2015.5 and up?I would recommend them for the price and they do exactly what I need them to do, help my wife in and out of the truck.  Me I don't like steps, but shes tiny so some things have to happen.Ive added photos of what the look like on the truck and how they fit the body lines.  Hope this helps.

This product claims that it will last from 6 months up to a year, but for hot climate weather countries such as the middle east this is not the case. I applied it on the tire on march 29, today is june 21. But still much better than the other tire shinning products, they usally last from 4 to 6 days. But this lasts around two months. Bare in mind we have alot of dust in the weather so the tire will get dirty quickly. Minus 1 star for two three months lasting. The picture with the bottle when it first applied, the other one after around 3 months

shipped right to my door. installed perfect, fit perfectly. heavy duty like the OEM control arms. just remember when the part says LEFT upper or RIGHT upper...it's not you standing in front of the vehicle looking at the truck...it's you standing in front of the vehicle looking away from the vehicle. that's the correct RIGHT or LEFT. or imagine your sitting in the driver seat. anyways great product..also make sure you support the lower control arms when removing and installing the new upper controls. UPDATE  after  2 months...... one of the things we noticed when putting on the control arms was the ball joint was lifted up on one side. But we figured that was the design. We take it in for an alignment and even the technicians at Les Schwab were wondering the same thing we were if it was normal. They said there was no movement in them so they did the alignment and everything checked out okay. The steering wheel still wasn't quite straight so we took it back about 2 weeks later and they tried adjusting it more but they were unable to due to the ball joints. They just happen to have some Moog upper control arms and they said the ones on the truck are defective. The ball joint should be completely flush and should not be bent up the way it is. So we got another set of upper control arms installed on the truck and the ones that moog sent us are now junk.. I still think very highly and positive of Moog because I have bought a lot of Moog suspension parts and none of them have been defective. So why these ones are defective I have no clue. But we are unable to return them because it's been 2 months. but one thing to make sure when you receive these in the mail is make sure the ball joint is completely flush with the control arm. If not, immediately return.

Excellent wind deflector and extra protection from the elements. I found the mounting assembly material to be of very high grade metal along with the bolting accessories that mount with great ease. The actual plexiglass wind screen had some minor cracking blemishes at the edges that concerned me. I contacted the vendor and they told me they would send a replacement plexiglass screen only but so far I have not received it. The windscreen works like a charm but takes some visibility away since the screen mount is positioned center and the metal clamp is generous in size. I previously owned 3 scooters with large wind protection screens and moving categories to the motorcycle world this extra screen gives me the same level of protection on those long rides.

It's okay, material is not that thick but looks tough enough to last a few months. A building is being demolished near my house & I don't feel like washing may Mazda every other day to remove the dark gray dust from all the concrete. So far it's serving it's purpose. Winter is coming soon, I'll see how it holds up in very cold temperature, ice & snow.Take note if you own a 2015 Mazda 6 the car size is 192 L x 72 W x 57 H. Get the longer car cover. This cover will leave a couple of inches of paint exposed, it does not fully cover this car. (pictures attached)

Free product provided for evaluation and review.This towel is so good at absorbing water quickly that when I decided to dry my face with it, I went running for moisturizer.It is great for cleaning mirrors- it cleans them and dries them in one sweep leaving them streak free.  Its a very good towel - the edges are well serged and I didn't have any fading or shrinking when I washed it in cold water & tumble dried it.Its a bit surprising at first because it looks a bit thin, but it really is extremely absorbent- and it sucks the water up QUICK.  Its great when you want a streak free shine.Its fairly large at 22 by 30.  It feels quite soft.  I can easily recommend this towel for car drying or detailing, or cleaning mirrors or crystal.

Installed on my 2015 grizzly 700 EPS SE. has plenty of torque, enough to drag my 4 wheeler up a sand hill in the creek with the brakes locked effortlessly. the motor is nice and quiet and can barely hear it over the stock exhaust.  the synthetic rope is great, but keep in mind it has to be cared for and cleaned. Wrapping it tight on the drum will keep the rope from burying itself when its put under a load. Just tie off to a truck and have a buddy lightly brake while you guide the rope on the spool.  Either way its better than cable IMO despite not being as abrasion resistant.  I highly recommend the Factor55 Prolink XTV. It is a way better option for recovery than the plain hook.The supplied 6 gauge wire was more than enough to run to the very back, if your 4 wheeler has a battery installed at the rear.  on the Grizzly, the battery is under the front rack, so i had to cut 6 feet off every cable and crimp/solder new terminals to make a nice clean install. speaking of wiring its very simple and the solenoid and winch is color coated for which wire goes where.Pros: powerful motor, steel drum for synthetic rope, plenty of cable for installation, Quiet operation.Cons: Circuit breaker is not the best for mounting. its all exposed 12V on the body so you have to isolate it from coming in contact with metal.  large heat shrink in a few layers will solve this problem. but i feel they could have supplied one with a plastic body instead.  oh well, its an easy problem to fix.

If you have even done struts before, this is the easy way to install that is headache free. Spring compressors work great if all you have to do is repair the strut. However, my car had 227000 of Iowa winters on it when one of the springs finally broke. The struts were done probably around 150000, but it's a winter car. These struts were a GREAT improvement over my worn out ones. Handling was greatly improved, ride is nice, no weird noises. They are a quality product with no signs of "cheapness" at a glance. I only give it 4 stars because it did add 1" lift to the front of the car from the original stance. No, that's not the difference between my worn out struts and the new ones, that's based on original ride height. I personally don't care because again it's a winter car. It does look hilarious and I can now tell all my jeep buddies my car has a 1" lift.

It looks awesome, easy install for my son and I! We also purchased a heat gun and a squeegee (the vinyl pack) to install this. If you aren't too good at applying the vinyl, use a spray bottle with a little baby shampoo and water. After completely cleaning the area, wipe down with rubbing alcohol then spray the area with the baby shampoo/water mix. Put the vinyl down and use the squeegee to push the water out. The vinyl will begin to stick.If you're really good, have a buddy help you by pulling tight and stretch the vinyl over the area and apply.

The product is great, buy it because it is THE BEST BLACK TRIM PRIDUCT ON THE MARKET.The problem is the cap on the bottle leaks this expensive and staining black liquid everywhere! I have a stain in my laundry room and now on my patio pavers! It leaked once and so I cleaned it and put it into a thick ziplock and screwed on the cap tightly and then found it 2 weeks later leaked everywhere and even made it out of the ziplock. Cleaned it and put in new bag...same thing. Not only is it a horrible mess, but it expensive stuff!

This review is for a Folding, Collapsible, Reflective Sunshade from Alphashades. One of my younger brothers recently moved from southern Ohio and its basic 4 seasons out to Phoenix Arizona into the burning desert sun. As the season progresses towards spring time, he is already feeling the heat (pun intended). As he has already received a shock to his system in weather from Ohio to Arizona and the desert. He has been telling me stories of having to hide his car under trees when shopping or while parked at work. Well trees (birds + tree sap) is never a good thing for a cars finish, especially black paint. Not to mention he is having to pay extra to park under a covered awning at his apartment complex (talk about a racket). So I thought it would be a smart move on my part to get him a reflective sunshade that would really work, and not be just a piece of cardboard that took up his back seat. The pictures that are included are of the sunshade in use in his black car parked in the Arizona heat. His hands on the steering wheel and his back side on the seat are already thanking me as he no longer gets in to a scorching hot steering wheel and black leather seat (can you imagine that in shorts!). The sunshade easily fits into the window area of his Ford Fusion and covers from corner to corner. Plus it folds up nicely to store in his back seat when not in use. Now that this problem has been solved, its now time to work on talking him into getting a white car. And of course keeping the sunshade. Are you looking for a sunshade that actually works? Then take it from my brother and the desert sun, this one works!We received a discount to give our honestly quirky opinion of this product. No greenbacks were exchanged nor are we affiliated with the seller or Amazon. Push YES below?

Pretty solid product, put them on a 97 Road King as you can see in the pics. There was a little black paint rubbed off on the corner but nothing that can't be touched up easily. They have two sets of mounting bolt lengths for the Harleys and one is pretty short but grabs enough...I hope, the other set was too long. Used loctite with the combined set of washers and lock washers. The mirrors have small set screws base where it mounts and they are supposed to grab onto the mounting bolts, they are pretty cheesy, I overtightened one of them and stripped it.

This stainless steel license frame exudes class while surrounding your license plate with rust free elegance.  This frame has graced my wife's vehicles for over 8 years now without one bit of rust.  It looks as good as the day I first installed it.  That's why I purchased one for MY XC70.

Extremely easy to install, if you have air conditioner on your jeep, you will have a smal dificulty installing the filter plate housing. There is a screw that you must install in the radiator with a small plate, well that screw you will need it larger because of a air conditioner's hose that limits the space there. Great product you can feel the difference inmediatly, great torque and acceleration. It also looks espectacular.

How can you go wrong, these are a crazy good value. High quality LEDs with less power consumption and heat than halogens. They use the same LEDs as the expensive ones. Some say that they might leak or fog. I went to home depot and purchased calk size silicon for cheap and sealed everything myself just in case. I couldn't be happier and would suggest them to anyone.

I bought this battery isolator to use on my wakeboarding boat. I have two banks of batteries, one for the audio system and one for the engine/lights. I wanted to be able to combine them so that I didn't have to charge the second bank separately.The Ekylin 12V battery isolator arrived exactly as advertised and pictured. It is well made and the included hardware is high quality.Installation was a breeze if you have ever installed a relay type switch. This is essentially a larger, higher amperage version. The two large connectors are for your power passthrough (positive leads you want to interrupt) and the other two smaller ones are for the electromagnetic switch (one positive, one negative). The polartiy is marked clearly on the body of the unit.The unit works exactly as I had hoped. I gave it a good test yesterday out on the lake and it peformed flawlessly. All of my batteries are at the same voltage and I have no need to charge my second bank separately. I still have the ability to turn off the battery bank link, so that when the boat is off I only use power from my non-starting battery ensuring I do not get stranded and unable to start the boat.Overall, this is a very good quality battery isolator that I would recommend. It works exactly as advertised and is easy to install. I have had no issues with this, but will update my review if I have any problems.

The material feels like it will hold up. There are slots for the seat buckles, but you lose the middle seat belt. Not really sure this is very practical. Might be better if you have a middle lap only or one of those detachable seat belts.

No such thing as 2,3, or 4 stars.  Either 1 star, or 5 stars.The project was to splice the high mount cab lights on a pickup truck into the emergency flasher.The idea to choosing this unit was the size.  Small enough to tuck into tight spaces.  The included base was designed to mount onto a DIN rail, for motor controls.  Initial plan was to simply use insulated disconnects on wiring to connect, but the standard size disconnects that you would use on 10 - 20 AWG wires is too big to fit onto the terminals.  So I had to use the base, which now created a larger profile.  Still, I managed to make it work by tucking it snugly into a void between the roof and the headliner.The mounting base allows you to screw contact lugs onto bare wire, much like on circuit breakers.  This is good.  It is a very secure connection.  For anyone who is worried, a drop of solder will add peace of mind.  Completely unnecessary, since I've yet to see wires fall off if they're properly secured with a fastener.Insulate with heat shrink as needed, to protect your circuit.  Always use safety equipment.  Disconnect power while working on circuit.Product description is for 12V.  Double check to ensure that you actually have a 12V coil.  More than once, I've found that mistakes are made, and a unit is shipped with the wrong coil voltage.  Actually, more than once, seller and "fulfilled by Amazon" has randomly shipped relays with the wrong coil voltage.  I'm looking at a couple of them right now.  10A250VAC, and 10A28VDC.I'm the kind of guy who just shrugs his shoulders, and throws the wrong part into a spare parts bin.  I know that eventually, within my lifetime, I may need it.  But that is an absolute waste of money to receive the wrong item, then maybe never be able to use it. I can't find, anywhere, on the product description, what the maximum amperage is.  Bench test prior to use.Pricing and availability varies.  It cost a little more to get "fulfillment by Amazon", but that option allows for Prime Shipping.  Save a couple of bucks, and you wait for the seller to ship from China.

Save so much time with oil changes. Instead of jacking up the car and taking the wheel off, this is a much quicker alternative.Pros:- Made in the USA.- Light weight. Easy to carry around.- Very strong. It's been a year and no signs of deterioration or deforming yet. I store them outside.- Excellent grip technology.- My problem with clearance. My car bumper is pretty close to the ground.Cons:- NONE SO FAR!

Ok, in case you don't want to read all the details let me state that the rack is decent, functional *AND* will mount to the factory plastic crossbars on a 2012 Subaru Outback. It has some quality issues though.This review will consist of two main parts; Assembly and UsabilityAssembly: Thule is one of the big gear holder/rack manufacturers and with a $500 price tag I expected good things. I was disappointed.1: The instructions are ok once you figure out the pics are for a different sized rack and you're not really missing a piece.2: Some of the screws do *NOT* screw into a threaded hole but rather bite into square aluminum holes. That's ok if you're only going toassemble the thing once but what if I want to break it down at some point, like to sell or to pack if I'm moving?3: One of the important allen screws had a filled in head so I couldn't use an allen wrench to tighten it. I had to finger tighten it and then use needle nose pliers to tighten a little more. This will work.4: One of the brackets for mounting to a factory rack was larger than the others which meant the plastic cover would not snap on to it. I ended up having to cut the plastic to get it to fit. There are 4 such brackets/covers so I know how to put the plastic cover on, this is a manufacturing defect.I got this rack through the Vine program to review so I was ok cutting it. If I had paid for it given that I had 2 different manufacturing issues I'd probably have swapped this through Amazon of tested Thule's customer service. Still, for a 'premium' rack I expected better.Usability: So, once I got the rack put together I do have to say it shines. It's lightweight and was easy to get on the roof of the Subie. Mounting was easy as well and can be done without tools, it take 5-10 minutes. It's not really designed for the semi-oval, non-flat subaru plastic crossbars but it fit anyway. Looks great up there too! I got this just in time to get it on the roof and take a family camping trip. We threw 70 lbs of gear up there. The mount points are plastic but aren't weak, I used automotive ratcheting tie down straps and there were zero issues.  We did a 2.5 hours trip on the freeway to the mountains and some bumpy roads to the campsite. Everything stayed secure.So it's a good rack despite the manufacturing issues. We'll continue to use it, and in the end I'm happy with it. Pics are attached to see how it looks on the Outback and the plastic snipping I had to do for fit.

I drive a 2000 Camry with over 400k miles on her and I LOVE MY CAR! I have used NuFinish since my car was new. There is a reason why Consumer Reports always ranks NuFinish waxes at the top of their list for decaded. I recently had a scratch and dent repaired at a local body shop. I also had a factory painted spoiler installed. Even the guy at the body shop commented on how close the paint was to showroom finish specs. High praise considering that this is Miami and the car is usually parked in the direct sun and weather.

I discovered that the guys at my local quicky oiI change place ripped a big ugly jagged hole in my old splash shield on my 2008 Mazdaspeed 3 so they wouldn't have to remove it to replace the oil filter. I can't say that I blame them as it is a pain to take it off just for an oil change but I was upset that they didn't ask me permission first. Because of this I decided to to start doing my own oil changes and installed a spin-on oil filter conversion kit to make it a little easier. I bought this splash shield and like the others have said it is made of a much better, thick, higher quality plastic than the OEM shield. I also decided I didn't want to have to remove the splash shield every time I wanted to change the oil so I cut a nice, round hole right under the filter using a jigsaw. Turned out great!

Also works on gray bumpers that weren't black to begin with! Used on my 2001 sport trac to give it an all black appearance while still maintaining the stock abs plastic look. I love the way it looks. Took A LOT to get it actually black but totally worth it. I will update on durability as it wears. Also I used a wax on it quite possibly too soon so... Ill update on that as well. I shouldve given it more dry time I think. So far it looks incredible. There are places it absorbed better than others but theres not really any streaks or anything. I used a microfiber cloth instead of the included sponge. Someone else in these reviews recommended that and I do too. If you just work it in to the bumper in circles and use small amounts on the cloth at a time it works very well.

This is an excellent light! It installed easily once I figured out how I wanted to mount it and it's very bright. The spot/flood beam combo is great to get good surrounding light and also distant light to spot things in the road sooner on backroads and less busy roads.

Does the job but with no instructions included is a bit of a mystery to put together. Once that problem has been resolved it is a very functional product. Fits well too.

I love this hitch!! Very nice. I have a duramax with 33" tires and fits my trailers well. 1 thing I wished I did was spend the extra 10$ for the 3 ball. My enclosed race trailer sits low, so the adjustment is at its very lowest. Which makes the other ball not being used sit close to the ground. If I got the 3 ball this wouldn't happen because I would put the biggest ball on top. Just some advice if you drive a half ton because they sit low already. Get the 3 ball b&w. Very happy with this hitch would definitely recommend!

I got the GB40 1000 Amp as a gift from my wish list.  It's very solid, has nice thick cables and very heavy duty clamps.  The LED light is very handy and it seems very weather resistant with nice connector plugs.One down side is that it arrived at 25% charge.  Hopefully that doesn't indicate how poorly it will maintain a charge over time.  It comes with a 12v to USB plug and a USB cable for charging it.  I'm skeptical that it will charge in much less than half a day ... we'll see.  The ONLY way to charge it is through the USB cable.My USB Amp meter tells me that it's charging at 1.32amps.  The description says it should charge at 2.1amps with the provided cable.  Even with my other USB cable, that I know can charge at higher rates, it charges at 1.32 amps.  Perhaps the amperage will go up at different charge percentages?  I doubt it.  We'll see.UPDATE:  From a 12v perspective this one is a 2Ah (24Wh) battery.  So it charges in good time over the USB cable.  The charge amperage stayed at 1.3 to 1.4.  Never got over 2amps.

I bought this solar charger to maintain a charge on a 12v battery used to power a deer feeder. The feeder utilizes a spinner to throw corn. I have it set to dispense corn 2x a day for 10 seconds each time. The feeder runs year round. I've had this charger hooked up to the battery (bought both at the same time) since late August, 2015 and I just ordered a new battery this week. The charger has done a great job keeping the battery charged enough to spin corn for over 17 months, most of it's life it didn't receive direct sunlight all day long, this is a good product.

It was a bear to get the old bumper off but this went on fine with slight persuading. I wouldn't put to much pressure on those d-ring mount points as the bumper doesn't tie into the frame the way I would like it to if I planned to use it for recovery, same thing goes for the trailer hitch. This is more of an appearance item than a functional towing hitch.I added a frame tie in kit to get more use out of this bumper, like others have mentioned the hitch pin is 1/2" not 5/8". The welds seem good front and rear of the bumper. I added a fourth star now after having it for a while.

This is a great value on a quality plate frame. The frame is metal and is a car plate frame despite the name stating  "cruiser" just so you all know. Looks fantastic on a classic car and love how sharp the barbed wire is! Definitely gives your car definition and makes a statement. I highly recommend it because it is the same brand you would find in store for a lot less! You will only get one plate frame and the hardware is not included because it is not necessary, since you already have the hardware holding the plate on your car.

Temporarily mounted my plate to the carrier using zip ties.  I didn't want to deal with the hassle of getting pulled over even though I was probably ok.  Used neon orange ratchet straps to tie down cargo and for extra visibility of the carrier and contents.If strapped down correctly, you can easilystack ALOT of gear.The carrier is heavy but not as heavy as I thought after reading the reviews.  The curved chrome handles help make the handling easier.It's a nice option for future road trips or anything bulky/dirty I don't want to carry inside the vehicle.

nice and bright. Pure white light. Other than having to turn a few around because of reversed polarity, easy install. Have to bend the wires outward a bit for better contact. They should make them like tabs and gold plated so it's a better connection and no bending wire. Guess time will tell how long they last but love how bright white they are. Hit the map lights and its "Godmode".Update: 6 out of 10 have burnt out and started flickering. Guess these LEDs run too hot to be used for more than 20 minutes. They are burning the map light housing black because of how hot they get.

I bought this to attach to my Main Bag along with a rain cover. These are fantastic bags. The zippers need a little lube for smooth operation but are well made.

My air intake hose cracked while I was trying to change the air filter on my 2006 Mazda 6s Wagon.Amazon to the rescue with prime and free same day delivery and voila, the car is fixed. The part seems to be made entirely of rubber (according to the web site) however it really feels like it is silicon, all flexible which I like, compared to the original part from Mazda (all hard plastic).Removing the hose is really straightforward after you remove the two clamps using a Philips screwdriver. It makes it easier if you remove the top of the box where the filter is located. Be careful when you remove the sensor from the air intake box, these things can be brittle.I used some silicon grease to lube both ends of the hose in order to put it in and seal the connection. The hose is really flexible and seems sturdy enough that it will probably outlast the car.It's been only a few hours that the hose is in place, so far no error codes came off so I'm confident that it will be fine. I will update after a few weeks or so if something comes up.Enjoy!

1 June 2017 Update:Several of my ten pack have shorted out, causing half of the SMD's to fail. Now this wouldn't honestly bother me, but they don't just "go out" the FLICKER. Having them on the front of my bike, dubious. Having them FLASHING on the front of my bike, untenable. I never got any unwanted attention until they started doing that. I don't know what causes this, but they cannot be used once they start flickering, it's too close to impersonation.--- Original ---Bright, solid, and absolutely unmissable, I already know I'm going to love these lights. I'll be the first to acknowledge their placement is dubious. However, I think they get a scathing pass on account they're on a motorcycle. It makes me much more obvious in traffic and I love these upgraded version. My last set was a freebie from a friend with 4  SMD's (individual light emitters) which makes these 30% brighter. While those were amazing, these will be perfect for a long while. I also was behind several cars who would question them in my local area, and I've never been hassled. YMMVPros:-As bright as you'd imagine.-As described, these fit a normal light slot for say park lights.-Prrreeetttyyy...-Cheap, but feels as good as anything you'd get from autozone.Cons:Not really any. Your ability to actually research what fits your vehicle and your placement on your vehicle are your responsibility.I'll get some other, different colors for the interior of my 4Runner.

I hope Meguiar's never stops making this stuff, as it is a vital part of my detail kit for my Truck. I use this weekly after every wash and it keeps my truck glossy and keeps the water droplets beading and flying off the paint rather than sticking to it. Goes on easy EVEN in the SUN and comes off easy!

I just bolted this onto my 99 Jeep XJ and so far it's doing what it's supposed to do. Fit perfectly out of the box. Comes with the hardware for the press-fit stud but not the bolt/nut on the axle end, so be careful removing the old stuff. I recently lifted the XJ and put 31s on and the old stabilizer was allowing too much bump-steer on uneven terrain so this suddenly became necessary. After driving around with it on, it seems to perform as well as the more expensive ones I have used in the past for similar applications. Hopefully the durability is also comparable or better. Luckily I remembered to paint it green before I installed it, so now I get better gas mileage too.

I've been looking at an easier way to change the oil in my car. I have a gravel drive so trying to use a creeper and all that just doesn't work well. Anyway enter this gadget/tool whatever you want to call it. So I run the car for 5 minutes to warm it up and get the oil so it'll flow good. I followed the instructions inserted the extraction tube all the way. Pumped 10-15 times then let the let the little tank do the work. Now here's what I did in addition to the instructions based on some other reviews I read including one where Another reviewer said no matter what he did he couldn't get more than 2 quarts out of his engines see #2 about this issue. 1. Remove the oil fill cap from your valve cover! 2. Once it extracts 2quarts/Liters it'll slow way down (like the reviewer I mentioned said). I gave it an additional 10 pumps this sped the extraction up until I hit 3.2-3.5 quarts/liters I gave it 5 more pumps and pow over 4 quarts out of my 2006 Grand Prix 3. I removed the extraction tube hung the tube up high so it would drain the oil in the line down into the tank.On 2004-2008 Pontiac Grand Prix's:4. jack up the car a few pumps and turn the wheels all the way to the right to access the oil filter. There is still oil trapped in the filter so have a pan ready. Unscrew old filter, pre-load new filter and install. Lower car fill with new oil and done. All in all it isn't any faster than doing it the conventional way but it is a lot cleaner! I never had to actually get under the car! For me that's priceless.  Edit: I own 2 Pontiac Grand Prix's, works great on my 2006 GP but this won't work on my 2008 Grand Prix. The dipstick tube on my 08 seems to get smaller than the extraction tube just shy of getting into the oil pan. I'm currently trying to find a smaller tube to add to the extraction tube to get in there...

I mounted this on my 2006 jeep liberty.  I then placed a j rack on the rails for my kayak.  These crossbars are rated at supposedly 125lbs, my kayak weighs 50lbs and the j mount's each weigh 4.5lbs.  All total well under the 125lb limit.  Everything was installed following the provided instructions.  After placing my kayak on the rack the rear rack plastic grips snapped.  The only good thing I can say is thank god they broke before I was driving down the highway.  Do yourself a favor and buy a quality rack if you plan on being safe while driving.I also did a separate review for the seller - when I contacted them they did immediately get back to me, however they wanted pictures as proof of the problem.  In addition to that, the return label you print out is not pre-paid.  UPS and fedex shipping was around $20 to send these back!

Very happy that I decided on these. I was considering the cheaper lights offered on amazon but they didn't have the greatest reviews. This one was more expensive but had the best reviews and boy am I happy I decided to get them. Installed in 2 minutes and it looks awesome. Very well constructed and very bright. There is no way water is getting side of these like it would with the other brands. The LEDs are inside of a silicone material, not in a tube that allows water and condensation. I only have them plugged into my trailer harness right now but I plan to hard wire them soon. I'm Very pleased. Only downside was that the enhancing surface wipe that they give you to strengthen the hold on the 3m tape was dried out and I could use it.  I used an alcohol swab to clean my surface. The picture I attached was taken from a higher elevation from Inside the house so hard to see how awesome they really look.

Boom!  Inexpensive lights for an ACE rear bumper. ACE Engineering has lights they sell for $100 with the bumper or you can spend a quarter of that for these and toss in and they fit perfect!  They make excellent reverse lights integrated into the rear bumper.While I cant speak for using them up front and the light spread? For reverse lights, they're amazing!  And inexpensive to boot. Hardware looks to be stainless as well.

Bought two of these for my car (sold by Northern Lights Auto Supply). Unlike what is shown in the description photos, the ones I got were poorly-marked parts supplied in plain ziploc bags. Sent them back.After reading more reviews, I see WE GO GLOBAL is supposedly selling genuine GM sensors, so I ordered one and it appears to be legit. The bag is heat-sealed and has a GM label with the part information printed on it. The sensor markings are clean and crisp, with "Schrader Electronics" clearly marked on them (Schrader makes them for GM), a stem date code of 0517 and a sensor date code of 0317. Photos are of the WE GO GLOBAL part.

I purchased these to replace the 9005/HB3 halogen DRL/highbeam bulbs in my 2014 Subaru WRX STi. The STi comes with HIDs low/standard beams from the factory, but halogen 9005 bulbs for DRLs and high beams. The HIDs are a brilliant white color while the DRLs/highs are an amber/yellow color. It doesn't really look good, especially when combined.I'll start by listing the good thing about these bulbs:-PriceAnd now the bad:-Not even remotely 6500K; much closer to 7500k (they're very blue)-Did not properly fit my car even though 9005 is a standard size-Beam definition was non-existent-No way to position the LEDsThe bulbs are a good price, but otherwise not useful at all. I've included several pictures; the closeup of the bulb installed shows just how blue they are. The camera corrected the white balance and made my HIDs look a dull yellow color when they are white in real life. You can even see how blue they are from the other picture that shows the HIDs and highs on at the same time. It's also very easy to see how thin and wispy the beams are.Since every car is different, it would be helpful if there was a way to rotate the LEDs to match your reflector. I had to shoehorn these things in because, even though I have a standard 9005 socket, the tabs are spaced differently on these bulbs. What should have taken 10 minutes to install instead took 45.All of this being said, I think some of the issue might be that my particular reflectors didn't respond well to the LEDs. For the most part it seems like your results will vary greatly depending on what kind of reflector your car has. I would imagine perfectly round reflectors or large reflectors would work much better. Still, the inaccurate color temperature and fitment issues are a major concern.I returned these and replaced them with "NEW BRIGHTS" 80w LED kit. I've had mixed results with those as well, but I'll be reviewing those shortly. In the end, I think I'll end up sticking with HIR bulbs which are not only cheaper but also arguably brighter.

its a light bulb. and in my application, a reverse light. the ones I installed work so far. The packaging could benefit from a little strip of construction paper between bulbs though, as one of the bulbs arrived broken, so I guess its a good thing there is 10 of them in a box.

This is the same as the "40910 Bushing Press Set" from Specialty Products Company (http://store.specprod.com/productdetail/M50/1/1/40910). The included instruction sheet even references that company. The included parts were way too small for my application (90s 2500 GM truck), but I was able to buy adapters which fit well enough to use. The reviewer who said that the C-clamp is a couple inches too short is right on; I ended up having to use a metal bar instead of the included cone device that is supposed to go on the end of the screw.Additionally, the little cap that fits on the end of the screw's ball bearing snapped in half the first time I tried to use it. I was able to make do without it but the screw does have a tendency to burrow into whatever you put just in front of it. You really should use a thick hardened steel plate here; I didn't have one that was thin enough to fit with everything else within the length of the clamp. Oh well.Adapters I used for the upper bushings (shown in picture):http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SIA6KIhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SIAMHUThis one fit over the larger lower bushing:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SIDMKO

I keep my car garaged all winter and wanted a simple cover to prevent any accidental scratches and to keep dust and debris off my 2016 Mustang. This cover fits nearly perfectly without any tie downs and has a paint friendly lining. It will NOT do well outdoors in an uncovered setting and is NOT weatherproof. This cover is more of a dust cover for storing your vehicle indoors.

Perfect color match to our oxygenics shower head.  Original had no spout, this does so great to fill the small tub portion of the shower stall to wash the dog or give the small grandkids a bath without using the showerhead to fill the tub. The original white housing with the two knobs had the outlet to the showerhead at the top which was ugly ... also it must have been getting clogged up with time because the new Dura Faucet increased the showerhead pressure considerably.  It's made of super light weight plastic with a fantastic finish ..  You would think it was metal.  Direct fit, took less than 10 minutes to replace. Does make a bit of a buzzing noise on shower mode but not a problem for us. Great upgrade!

Very well designed jump starter and accessory charger. I love the fact that if you accidentally swap the positive and negative leads that the unit will protect itself from damage. Another great feature is the display which shows how much the unit's battery is charged. It has a built in compass that is very accurate. Been wanting one of these ,but I couldn't afford one with the capacity that I wanted until I saw this one. Most of the units like this have only an 8,000 to 10,000 mAh battery and will not crank anything but a small 4 cylinder engine. If you want to crank a large V6 or a V8,you need one like this one. This has a nice case that comes with it that holds all the cables and the charger. Not only will this jump start your car,it will also recharge every phone in your family ! Also has a very good built in flashlight ! What more could you want in one of these ?

I bought these for my 2011 Camaro SS. The fitment is correct for the car, but the appearance doesn't suit me at all. The visual proportion of the lug nut is way too skinny for the location. Gorilla needs to make a muscular locking lug nut for muscle wheels. The pic shows one Gorilla installed on the wheel. It only took one for me to know I didn't want that look. Probably going to return these - and I 'm not the sort of buyer who returns stuff because I changed my mind about the "style" of it.

I bought this item as part of a larger "kit" for my 2008 Honda Shadow Aero that included the Kuryakyn 4393 Premium Mini Board, the 8818 Splined Adapter Mount, and the 8837 2" Offsets. These are high-quality items, and everything went together smoothly and looks great. The mini boards and extenders did a nice job of lowering the footbase about 1 inch for my passenger and bringing it forward about 2 inches. Longer passenger boards would have interfered with my ability to back up effectively, but these turned out just right.One thing to consider if thinking of offsets, is that given the angle of the offsets to the axis of the splined adapter, I might be concerned about the torque generated if a larger passenger were to plant their full weight firmly on the boards in the process of getting on. Could it break the mounts? Fortunately, my own regular passenger is quite small, but if you've got a Big Momma (or Papa) on back, you may want to think about this, or talk to Kuryakyn support about how much weight the assembly can bear.

these lug nuts don't flake off like other cheepos, THE TRICK is to wrap some paper around the lug nut, then tighten them down, saves them from getting marks and grinds on them, clean often too, even makes clean steelies look good!!!

Direct fit on my 1978 chevy k10... no cutting ... no drilling ... no nothing ... I installed a HID kit and looks amazing ... if you are looking to upgrade your old headlights to HIDs then this is the way to go... I tried going with LED lights but it required some modification. Wasn't trying to cut my truck up... can't believe all this fit right in.

.... or the photograph may be wrong.  Authentic Timken Hub Bearings are among the very best made, however the Amazon photograph shown here is NOT what the authentic Timken HA590046 hub-bearing looks like. The yellow zinc rear cap shown here is NOT on the real McCoy. The authentic hub assembly has a silver nickel plated cap. The studs on the authentic Timken assembly are Black hardened steel, NOT silver!  More importantly the thickness of the disc mating plate is UNIFORM on the authentic Timken bearing assembly, while this photograph clearly shows that the plate gets thinner from stud location to stud location, not very strong. So either this is a FAKE Timken, or the photograph is an error. Here is the real TIMKEN HA590046 bearing from their Website:*UPDATE*: I spoke with Timken today and they do not make this Hub Bearing at all. In fact it is a "Quality Part Transfer" from other "Carefully Chosen Manufacturers", then re-boxed by TIMKEN! No where on the bearing nor on the Timken box does it say the country where it was manufactured.  Translation = NOT THE REAL McCOY ... made probably in China.

Update 7/5/16Finally got them mounted. Truck set for 2 days without being driven went out to align them and noticed  condensation inside one of lens hasn't rained but has been high humidity lately. Attached is a picture at approximately 10', the light that has moisture inside it has the larger pattern.Building a bumper for the bronco and going to mount these in it. They throw a lot of light and plenty bright, going to have to mount them pointed down to keep from blinding the on coming cars. I'll up date this review after a few trips to the mud.After 5 months on the truck they still work and no moisture inside them been through several hard rains and a lot of vibration from off-roading. I did place silicon around the one that had leaked at the start did not mess with the other one. It still has a wider beam but works just fine. I was contacted by the seller about replacing the faulty one, I think that's good customer support. I'll keep the replacement one as a spare in case one quits.

Big improvement on my rear coil spring after installing the RC, I am pleased with the results. This item does the job and with the least expenses mods.Prior to installing the RC, the coil spring had about 1/4" space from the TB. Now, the gap had increased to about 3/4" from the TB. It also strenghten the spring in a upright position. First pix, before the RC Correctional Plate and the second pix was taken after the install.

The tool broke and not a adapter so i can still do other jobs. the maine part of the tool rendering the kid useless. In the picture the dark gray box is a matco kit light gray is this wast of money kit. I got the kit because im doing a ballancer on a chevy 8.1l big block and it takes a m16x1.5 thread pitch adapter, matco kit does not have it to my suprise. Orderd this kit for that. My mistake was using all the parts from the kit for the job resalthing in an tool extraction that took an extra 30min and special tools you probly don't have at home for you weekend wariors.

Bought this as a replacement for my 2008 Outback with 115000 left rear OEM wheel bearing. This bearing was less than half what the dealer quoted me for the OEM Subaru (over $200) bearing, and I've trusted the Timken brand with nearly all my bearing replacements on the farm so decided to give this a try. Great quality out of the box, fit well, has the correct ABS magnet ring on the inside bearing.UPDATE: Two years later and 30,000 miles on this bearing it went bad. Typically, Timken has been my go-to, high-quality supplier but even after using factory specs on the axle bolt, this bearing gave up before any of the rest now with over 140k on them. Disassembled the bearing and found the race had fatigued and started severe spalling, as seen in the pictures, both on the inner and outer race. Timken has remained silent on what I thought was a 3-year warranty. Disappointed with the quality on this bearing.

Quite bright, but very uneven beam throw.  I couldn't use these because of the disparity between bright and dark spots in the beam was too much.  If they were used only in conjunction with other lights, it might no be a problem.

These are basic quality hose clamps with the little flat pointed screwdriver clamp adjustment. They look real nice but I was expecting some sort of fuel injection type compression method or at least a quality clamp inside. If you are looking for a decorative SS hose clamp order away.If you are looking for a quality clamp that will hold higher fuel pressure then this is not your product.It would be really helpful if the photos of the product included the back side of the clamp so you could see the screw and the cutout in this pretty clamp that reveals the inner "basic" hose clamp.

Plenty of adjustment space left and right.The light bar will mount great on TOP of something, but not well on the FACE of anything.  Not enough angle in the brackets to let the light tilt up, even if you flip it over, there isn't enough range in the brackets to align the light to level.IF you mount the light on top of a brush bar or roof rack, it will be fine.  Mounting mine to the front of a roof rack, there isn't enough range in the bracket to get the light level.  I had to re-engineer my mounting point.Noise:  The cooling fins on the back of the light whistle extremely loud depending on the mounting surface.  Mounted to the fairing of my roof rack the wind across the back of the cooling fins causes great pain in the ears with whistling.  If you mount on the front of a vehicle or similar, it probably won't be an issue.Light output.  Very Bright, the Spot/Flood option works well.  (see video - regular vehicle lights then LED light bar)Comes with heavy gauge wire and weather pack connector, length is ok, you'll be adding more cable on to it anyway.

Great bar. Solid construction. Good thickness. Easy to bolt one. Had to take the tow hooks off but that's no big deal. I like the way my lights fit into the opening. Not really much for function but bought for the look. Only draw back is that the front touch sensor beeps as soon as I put the vehicle in Drive. Not a limitation of the bar but the vehicle. You need to know how to turn that off if your vehicle has sensors.

Absolutely awesome, perfect pattern settings and more.  Everything I hoped for and more.  Trick to getting the suction cups to work is to dip each set of three into WARM water, not too hot not to deform, but warm to soften the plastic and make it more applicable and stays on like glue.  You will need to hold on place with good pressure with the cups still wet and warm, and wah lah they stay up.UPDATE:  Day two and they are malfunctioning. contacting customer service about a replacement. will update again after testing replacement. And will update rating.UPDATE:  Second update, received the replacement today and installed and it is freaking awesome, very bright with an extra ring of leds that surround the main led. love this light bar, perfect for construction etc. Superior quality!Update 3, I had the cigarette lighter go out on me, probably because I use it a ton, but I contacted the seller and they sent me a replacement free of charge and I received it in THREE days! Their customer service is impeccable, DO NOT BE AFFRAID TO BUY FROM THIS COMPANY, I couldn't be more satisfied with how I was treated and with their products!

I purchased two of these 2 packs.  One set for each of my trailers. A 20' Flatbed 8000k car hauler and a 28' Enclosed 12,000k car hauler.  I have used these wheel chocks for about 5 weeks and since I am in the middle of moving I have actually used them allot on all types of surfaces from wet ground to pavement both on flat and slopped ground.  So far they work well.I would like to caution that I don't think they would hold my fully loaded 10k trailer if my trucks breaks failed when parked on a hill. I am basing this off my truck+trailer going across the scales around 21,000 GVW and the multiple times I have had to park on a hill. I have a steel chock I use on my truck in conjunction with these plastic ones. I wouldn't park on a hill without a larger metal wheel chock.For reference when I am on a hill I have my passenger place the wheel chocks then slowly roll forward until the chocks are holding all the weight then set my park break and put the trans in park.  This way the strain is not placed on my trucks park break or trans.I recommend these for anyone looking for an inexpensive wheel chock for storing their trailers on level ground.(The damaged wheel chock was me backing into one of the chocks when it was placed in-between my tandems. It still works)

Have been a long time Camco customer and am very pleased with their products, this one misses the mark. Received sewer hose today and upon opening there's so much grease on the outside of it that I had to wipe it down before I could handle it. Then, when I went to tighten the lock-nuts like the instructions say, I noticed the inner sleeve has excess wire protruding into the opening. Now if this just handled H2O it'd be no problem.... It doesn't, the wire will trap all sorts of debris and paper. Ugh! Last thing I want to do is pick paper out of my hose.Quality control at Camco seems to be slipping. Just an average 3 star product, expected better from their company.

I recently bought a used 2010 Toyota Tundra DC and it has scratches in the door sill paint from the previous owner.  These worked perfect for covering those up and protecting it from and further scratches!  These are pretty easy to install.  I wiped the area good with denatured alcohol to get off any oils or wax then just peel and stick working any bubbles from the center out.  I think they look great!  I have pictures of the front and back door sills here.  The only thing I could say bad is that they are a little expensive for what they are (adhesive backed thick vinyl) but they do the job that they are supposed to and I don't think you would want them thicker under the door.

We need LED 1076 bulbs for our Vintage Argosy by Airstream Motorhome/ RV and these worked great!  All 12 bulbs worked for us!  In the past, I had bought 2 bulbs at a time for a higher cost. I saw these offered on Prime and decided to give it a try despite some average reviews. SO glad I did!  In a RV, we are always worried about amps so we were anxious to convert to lower amp LED.(In the picture, you can see the round light closer to you as a soft white light with the new LED. The light in the background is a normal bulb with the dull yellow light.)

As a preface, I am using this with a 35w H11 conversion kit, relay harness, and capacitor.  They are installed in factory (halogen) projector housings, with the bulb mount plates modified to place the filament pointing-down (since H11b bulbs are hard to come by).To begin, the product came packaged in a padded (bubble-wrap lined) envelope with no protection, other than the foam coverings on the bulbs themselves.As for the functionality, I did not run into any issues getting them to power on.  However, once they were completely warmed-up, the output was not very bright on the majority of the roads that I traveled., and were completely useless in wet conditions (road was not illuminated).  Furthermore, the color temperature was definitely not what I was used to for 6000k (cool white; white/blue).  Instead, they had a very predominant teal tint (basically a washed-out teal/white color), especially when compared to my pure white LED switchback lights.  In either case, they are far cry from what was being advertised in the product title ("Ultra White").With that being said, I was immediately regretting my purchase, but had to use them until I can get a replacement pair (from a completely different company/brand) shipped from Amazon.Another comment you may have seen, which I've experienced, was the fact that there was NO in-line rubber grommet.  I find that ridiculous, as most people who are using H11 bulbs w/ a conversion kit, have dust plates that were required to be drilled through in order to feed the igniter wiring, and lead cable to the relay harness.I am extremely disappointed, and will not purchase bulbs from this brand again.

I spent an extra couple bucks for the black version of the Greenfield, because I knew it would nicer on my electric purple Scott Seattle.Greenfield is the epitome of classic reliability, so it was never a question of brand, only color.The Seattle already had a plate for kickstand mounting, so I made a trip to the hardware store for a shorter bolt, and tossed the mounting plate into the trash.  It is kind of neat that this thing is made in USA and takes standard bolts.  Sort of like 1978 all over again; I'm gonna go watch the Rockford Files...

I find it odd that neither manufacturers nor vendors give actual dimensions for their wares. The Biltwell site does give some dimensions for these, but unfortunately not for the part where your hand grabs on.Why do we replace motorcycle grips? Maybe the original ones are looking a bit shabby. Maybe we'd like another color. Perhaps we'd like grips which feel more like squeezing the Charmin. Or maybe we get hand cramps from holding onto those pipecleaner-size grips they put on motorcycles nowadays ... in which case, the size of the replacements is just a teensie bit important. But all they'll tell us is how big they are on the inside - 7/8", or 1". Not so useful - hands go on the outside of the grips, not the inside.I bought these for a new Royal Enfield because they looked like the biggest diameter grips I could find ... dimensions would have been nice, but lacking those, I went by looks and by guess.Here's the size information.These are short - 4.875" overall length, or .185" (about 3/16") shorter than the ones I'm replacing.Diameter at the outer portion (near the outer safety wire groove - not IN the groove; outside it, where your hand could go) is 1.36", swelling to 1.56" at the wide part in the center (a big improvement over the RE's standard 1.22" diameter grip), and back down to 1.37" (near the inner safety wire groove). The big flange is ridiculously huge - 2.55" diameter. My originals were much more sensible, at 1.81".In my installation, the dimensions of the right grip are larger (1.44", 1.63", 1.43" rather than the left grip's 1.36", 1.56", 1.37"). This is because the Royal Enfield throttle tube is a large clunky plastic thing with gripping nubs all over it and large flanges at each end. To get these new grips to fit I had to disassemble the throttle cable system and take down the throttle tube flanges with a belt sander. I put the new grips on both sides with the compressed air method. My old air compressor is a bit feeble, too feeble for pneumatic tools, but just right for inflating tires, and that's enough for this job. I put on a thin tube nozzle and used that to inflate the new grips; they blew up a bit, like balloons, and slid onto the handlebar and the throttle tube without any trouble. (I didn't use any lubricating stuff in there, or any adhesive - the Biltwell site has a video recommending WD-40 and not much else.) End result - the new RH grip is expanded to a larger diameter than its left-hand brother because of the large throttle tube it's stretched over.I had to cut out the closed outer ends of the Biltwell grips. I did a rough cut with an Xacto knife with a nice new blade, then widened the holes to the right size with a Dremel tool. The little coarse Dremel grinding tips work well on this rubber, even though they're intended for metal.The photo shows the new grip installed, and the original RE grip sitting on top for size comparison. The end cap in the photo is a custom piece of 1018 steel I machined to fit my bar-end mirror, and disguise the fact that the new grip is a tad short and would look funny if I didn't hide the exposed bit of handlebar.

And again - one more product, that claims to be more than it really is.I own Toyota Corolla 2010. I tried to do something with it's dim low-beam headlights, and purchased Philips HIR2 bulbs, but they are may be 10% brighter. Now I tried more expensive PIAAs, which claim to emit light equal to 115W bulb, with common 55W. Well, definitely does not work with Toyota Corolla 2010. They are as bright as Philips and a bit brighter than my stock Silvania bulbs.I was hoping to get better performance.Check out the comparison, done with the same camera and same car. LOW-BEAM ONLY![...]

High quality thick rubber, yes I received 2 stabilizers and they are thick, supple rubber. The hole in my wheel is 1 3/4" so I trimmed slightly and it fits tight and in my opinion very neatly. I never found inserts for my size wheel so I made them work. Picture below. I recommend this product.

I bought these lights 2 weeks after purchasing my vehicle. As soon as they came in I installed them in my car. At the time of buying I thought they were just going to be a cheap blue led that gives off barely any light. But after installation I couldn't be more happy with the results. These lights are pretty bright and give off plenty of light  at night. They look just like what is shown in the pictures.  As far as customer service, these guys are beyond great. They looked into the problem and dealt with it in a fast professional manner.  I will definitely buy from this seller again, and would recommend everyone else to buy from this seller also

I bought this filter to put on the return line from my transmission cooler.  It's a 4R100 in a '99 F250 SD 4x4 with 3/8" lines and it attaches without any problems.  Can't say enough good about it.  I cut the thing open after running it for 1500 miles and found quite a bit of material inside, both on the magnet and the paper filter.  The paper filter looks just like a small version of the old-school canister filters you'd find on tractors and the like, along with late model BMW engines.  The magnet wraps around the outside of the cylindrical case.I installed this due to the fact that my remanufactured transmission seemed to have some particulate in the new torque converter and on the input shaft when I received it from shipping.  As you can see from the pics, there was a lot of dirt in my "new" transmission after only 1500 miles, and this little filter probably saved it from getting destroyed right away.  For good measure, I pulled off the cooler bypass fittings as well, and I found a large chunk of black paint stuck inside the return port.  This was from when the hack who put my transmission together contaminated it with junk.  So while I'm not hopeful that the transmission will last very long, I'm confident that this little filter does its job.  I had a replacement sitting there that I swapped in place of the dirty one.  I just ordered 3 more; one to replace this one, and one each for my other Fords that have integral filters that can't be serviced.

It is well made. The "plug" provided has a countersunk Allen rather than the hex head as is shown in the ad's photo. The remainder of the photo is accurate. I did not use the product as intended. This design can either loosen and/or leak. The sealing washer, plug and the "inside" nut were not used. A longitudinal cut was made (by hacksaw) in the "stem" (which penetrates the pan) down to the inside surface of the pan. The "bung" was then brazed to the pan (outside & inside). The finished version will not leak or loosen, and will allow complete draining of the fluid. A magnetic square head plug was substituted for the Allen plug.

I am accustomed to quality at or better than factory OEM when I buy Wix alternatives among oil, air and cabin filters for our various cars.  This product is just a slight disappointment, and I'm surprised.The factory original cabin filter (see customer supplied photo) has a line of glue down the middle that stiffens the pleats against a strong flow of air, and keeps the pleats separated among the rows to achieve maximum filtration and airflow.The Wix, as seen in the vendor's photo, does not have this reinforcement, and I will be watching whether there is any distortion of the filter insert after a period of use.Other minor details include the printed airflow arrow and model nomenclature, which are on the side that is not visible when the filter is correctly inserted. You see this label on the end of factory filter when you prepare to pull it out. Since the filter is slightly rectangular, it will go in but not fully seat if incorrectly rotated 90 degrees.On the upper right corner in the photo, you can see a slight flange of paper. These flanges can provide a visual cue for installation. The flanges parallel the length of the car for the filter to be oriented correctly. The arrow "should" point down, but that doesn't seem to matter since each surface on the filter looks identical.The quality/thickness of the paper is about the same as the original, as is the number of pleats.  This is an adequate substitute encouraging an owner to replace the filter and save a lot of money compared to the dealer price for parts and labor.  Took me about 10 minutes.

Mr. Gasket 3678 Starter Motor Heat ShieldI have another heat shield set-up and after buying this type and trying to get it installed I can't give this a rave review. :0(#1 The heat shield is way to close to the battery cable terminal and getting to get to the connections with the shield installed is a real pita.#2 When tightening the small ear that holds the shield in place at the solenoid, the aluminum tab spreads open and is not tight enough for my liking plus I fear it could vibrate loose and then what?Every installation is different I know, if your not afraid of re-engineering the shield then this is for you.I took some pictures and you be the judge.Thumbs down on this one.RagenRat

Here is my somewhat extensive review of the Rugged Ridge low and high mount snorkel 4 weeks after install.The overall product is good and works well. The quality of the low and high mount seems kind of cheap, but it holds up well. I have driven down the highway at 90+ mph and it didn't fly off or whistle. I actually got this snorkel as I didn't want to drill a lot out of the body of my Rubicon and I wanted something that required the least amount of drilling. This requires you to make a cut about 6-8 inches long behind one of the quarter panels on the hood, and if done properly you would never even know it was cut (my cuts were about a quarter inch off due to using a dremmel instead of an angle grinder and its kind of noticeable.....)Installation was easy, but I made sure I had every single tool and item in the directions. It took me 8 hours to install, though I spent probably an hour playing with my dog and another hour and half trying to somehow get my aftermarket Cold Air Intake to fit to the factory air box (as the stock intake tube is a joke and seriously affects the air intake into the engine). I wasn't able to do it either. So back to the crapping stock intake.I had heard from several other reviews that there are 3 issues with this snorkel set-up. The 1st being is that they whistle in the wind. I have not yet once had that happen on either the high or low mount. The 2nd issue was that the pipe leading from the bottom of the air box will touch the heat shield and cause some serious vibrations and rattling. I did have this happen, but only at a SPECIFIC point which ties into point #3, which is that you need to cut the plastic fender flare shield inside the wheel well (see images). When installing the snorkel I made sure I used a hammer to get the heat shield back about a half inch, which was plenty. It was about an 1/8 inch away from the pipe and it never touched, great! But when I went to put back on the fender flare, it now wouldn't fit and was rubbing against the pipe and pushing it back into the heat shield and then creating a lot of vibrations and noise. So as you can see from the pictures I had to cut inside the fender a little (very easy) and it makes it look a little crappy but it doesn't rub anymore. I plan on finding some sort of black plastic which I can bend of fit in to cover that spot but which doesn't touch the pipe.Otherwise the product is good and I'm not complaining.

The brackets them selfs are good and they fit my 2014 f150. The hardware that comes with it is pretty much trash. I tried countless times to use the little crush fittings and almost gave up, so I ended up using the 4 large bolts I had laying around that use to secure my satellite dish to my house and it works perfect. I'm using a 52" curved light bar from yita motor.

Seller claims 400W light!!!!! Bull S...t!!!!! It pulls 5.6A in 12V so it is around 60W light input. If it was 400W it would take around 36A. I know it is LED, but doesn't produce output light needed. What a scam!!! Return it, so disappointed

Easy install on my 2014 Harley Breakout only sticking point is fitting wires in the assembly. Solid construction and much brighter than the factory headlight.

First time using a product like this and this is amazing. First off Ive seen a few reviews stating it left a haze in the car...Im not buying it! I used it on my car that has a ceramic coating and it drier perfectly. I also used it on a rental with no wax or polish on it and it dried perfectly with no residue or haze! And it LOOKS FANTASTIC! Beautiful mirror shine and soft soft to the touch. I wouldnt use it in the windows. But it works well on them also! I highly recommend this product to anyone! Its great!!!

Worked just as expected. Had to install 6 ohm load resisters in parallel with the turn signal circuit to cancel the hyper flash. I am very pleased with these bulbs. The picture is with these bulbs on the top and JDM's h10 led fog lights on the bottom.

Very nice quality. One of them came with a ding on it right out of the box but it was very minor. Packaged tight in foam. This has to be done before it was packaged. It is not noticible so I won't deduct a star.

Exact OEM replacements for 1/4 the price. Local RAM dealer wanted 400.00 to replace the plugs in my truck. It took 45 min at home to replace my plugs. They came gapped and ready to go. I recommend the GearWrench 80546 5/8-Inch x 6-Inch spark plug wrench for the ram 5.7. There are some tight spots on the drivers side. The original plugs have 51,000 miles on them. As you can see from the photos they are bad and the gap was almost .20 over spec. Over all great product and super fast shipping.

Great thought and design, but not built from quality materials.  Eleven months and only a few trips, it's done.First installation had a clip break.  Took a trip to the local outdoor rec. store and got a replacement.Second, about the third trip and we noticed the fade.  Pulled up a photo of when it was new and the difference was night and day.Now, the fabric is so UV rotted, the fabric is simply pulling apart.I'm patiently waiting for Blue Ridge Overland Gear's spare tire bag to hit - the smaller one has been released.That's where I'm at with it.First pic, second pick is from about 10 months of use.*************************Update - Bought a new one to do a weekend camoing trip.  It was on for a total of five days.  Third photo shows the degree of fading.  It won't be long for the area around the straps to let go.

Comes with wiring harness for the compressor and also built into the harnes 2 more switches for your air lockers and also comes with one rocker switch and a wiring diagrams the only trouble I had wiring was what the diagram said ignition that held me up for a couple of hours I ended up splicing it to the cigaret lighter because it only turns on when the key is in the ignition. You will need to buy seprate the tire inflator kit in order to use it as a compressor also u will need a tank if you wish to run air tools if u don't want to use a tank get the arb twin compressor it can work your air tools at a constant rate.

I bought these at $15, and now they are $10 so the value is even better. They fit great in the bar ends of my stunt built ninja 250, and when I broke one (this thing happens when practicing stunting) I was able to just put the other in the same side no problem.

I put this filter on our 77 VW Westfalia in preparation for a 4K mile road trip this summer.  It performed well and protected my engine.I use 15w40 Delo 400 in my bus. Air cooled VW engines produce a lot of heat and are hard on oil. Especially when they're doing a lot of mixed driving (read freeway, back roads, dirt roads, climbs, etc). This filter kept the oil relatively clean and caught a ton of stuff.After our trip I disassembled the filter. First, the can is tough and thick metal with quality joints. Second, the filter is assembled well with metal end caps, even gluing and dense pleats. Third, the filter media is dense and well made synthetic material just like Purolator says.Ive never used purolator before this but all 3 of my cars will get purolator filters from now on.

Fits great on '09 Camry Hybrid.  I wasn't too excited about buying an OEM pump when the original died after only 40k miles.  Many people have had OEM pumps replaced, only to have them leak again soon thereafter.Will keep review updated as miles add up on car, but so far very pleased.  This comes with a gasket.  It has a groove in the mating surface where it's recommended that you also use something like a PermaTex gasket maker.Removal and replacement took about 1 hour on the Camry.  The PermaTex (not included) takes about a day to set up completely, so if you're using that, plan the job for your day off.  See photo for where the OEM pump was leaking... indicating a seal failure.UPDATE NOVEMBER 2017:. the Delco pump has failed after 28k miles.  I've added a second photo to show the failure mode is the same as the original pump with a bad seal evidenced by coolant residue at the weep hole.  The second picture has the Delco logo on the failed pump.

I have mixed reviews on this product. It works well, has lots of useful features but has its issues. I have a 2017 Harley Davidson Iron 883 and have a high flow air filter and Vance and Hines 3" slipon exhaust. The canned tune caused my check engine light to come on.  I ran an autotune and the results caused flat spots at certain rpm's and popping. I've read that it's a learning process and with some time and effort I'm sure it'll come to working out the bugs. I feel the results should be more positive quicker.

Complete ready to install kit, carriage bolts make it possible for one person install.  These are heavy duty with a large backing plate that should provide plenty of support.  I have 8 of these installed in my enclosed trailer and couldn't be happier.It should be noted the photos show after I painted these with Rustoleum spray on bedliner.  These come with a zinc plated finish.

Great jack for lowered cars! It's quite heavy and extremely well made. Rolls easily though on the garage floor. The padded handle has lots of control too for slowly and carefully lowering it back down. After using the stock jack for the past couple years for all my automotive projects I wish I got this sooner!

After using this can for a few months now, I wish I could give it 6 stars. It's a beast! It's extremely well made, as I'd expect it to be for the price. I have to store it in the cap on my truck, so I wanted one that wouldn't leak or give off fumes. This fits the bill! I'll even sleep in the back with this in there and there are no problems.

I generally don't talk bad about a company on internet forums but really wanted to share this incase it can help save someone else save the time, money and frustration Ive wasted.POR 15 rust preventive coating has its uses, while I don't think its necessarily a great product, I can see in certain applications where it can work to do what its designed to do. This post is not about the rust preventive coating everybody is familiar with, its about the TOP Coat product they sell in spray cans.When stripping an auto frame down to refinish I will generally send it out to be blasted and powder coated. On my current project I decided I wanted to do everything in my shop since it is a father/son project for my dad. We decided to use POR 15 rust preventive coating, metal etch primer followed by their chassis black top coat. I normally like Rustoleum if using spray cans, but thought It would be an upgrade using the POR 15 products since the rust preventive base coat was used. We followed surface prep to a T, absolutely overdoing each step and even taking extra steps than recommended by the manufacturer. What we were left with was a top coat that basically flakes off so easy it makes my blood boil thinking about it, especially since now the truck is back together and I cannot strip it again and do it right.Again we used all POR 15 products. Rust preventive coating followed by a light scuff, POR 15 metal etch primer and then POR 15 chassis black Top Coat. The top coat bond is so bad that it will peel up if even motor oil sits on it for any period of time (minutes)! I applied some painters tape to the top of the frame rails to protect the paint while mounting my radiator. When I pulled the tape off, 100% of the POR 15 Top Coat came off with the tape leaving bare primer on the frame rails (see picture). There was absolutely no resistance bond when pulling this tape off either, and the edges where the tape pulled it off can easily be flakes off with fingernail pressure. I'm sure within a years time the frame is going to look terrible and be all chipped and flaked.How can an established company put out products that fail so miserably (and charge a premium for them to boot!) These spray cans were close to $25 each! I thought maybe it was just a bad batch of Top Coat paint, but I bought these from different vendors weeks apart so it cant be isolated to just the cans I received. I feel sick when I think about all the hard work we put into building the truck and the fact that Im going to be plagued by the terrible decision to use these products. If nothing else I will use this hard lesson to teach others to spend their money on better products that also happen to cost much less.

The decal seems to be of good quality Vynal, but the logo has a flaw in the "I." You can actually see it in the stock picture. There is about 10% of the "I" that is white and should be yellow. I got two of them and they are both like this. No one but me has ever noticed it though, it's not a major issue.

I bought a can of this Nu Finish Paste and then began to seriously question whether I had made a good decision or not and whether I should keep it or return it.  All the the other products were at least twice the price so I figured maybe there was something wrong with it.  I read every review from Meguires, Mothers, and pretty much all the others together withh all the reviews for this Nu Finish as well.  In the end I decided to try it and use the money back guarantee if needed so I set out to do my 2003 Harley Electra Glide Ultra.  I have to say I was truly blown away by how good this stuff works.To apply the product I used the Meguires DA Dual Action Drill Attachment - It applied extremely easily, and dried to haze quickly.  It is a smooth paste with no abrasives in it (which was one of the things I was concerned about).  One dried it removed extremely easily as well and it left no white marks in the black paint or on the black rubber & plastic trim.  On completion my bike looked sensational -  like new - with a deep rich gloss - honestly.  I've included some photos.  Like I said this bike is an original Black 2003 Anniversary Edition.  Last year the dealer dropped my bike and had to replace the the front fairing and the gas tank so those two parts were essentially brand new with new factory paint.  There rest of the bike is original 13 years old.  Take a look at the pictures - the whole bike looks incredible with no real difference between the new and the old except for some of the scratches in the old parts which are now greatly mitigated.I was so impressed after finishing the bike which was a much easier job than i was anticipating, that I did my wife's car - an electric metallic blue Veloster and it too looks sensational.I don't understand the negative reviews or comments, they certainly don't math my experience.  I've now used this stuff and am more than ecstatic with the result.  I don't think there's a need to spend $20 to $30 for a container of the "other" polishes.  This stuff just works, it works well and it is easy to work with. The one thing I didn't do was Claybar the surface of the vehicle before polishing.  I can see how that would have taken some of the imprefections out of the paint dsurface before polishing.  But lets be clear, no polish is designed to remover the imperfections.  Thats why detailing a vehicle is a multi step process.  But having said that, I'm still impressed with the result and will claybar first the next time I polish.The Meguires DA (Dual Action) Power System Drill Attachment is a great tool for applying the the Nu Finish or any other polish . It distributs the product in perfect circular motion and ensures distribution of a thin even film.  I highly reccomend both the Meguires Tool and the Nu Finish Soft Paste but am certain that the soft paste would have been just as easy to work with without the orbital applicator.  For removing the polish I simply used Microfiber cloths and it came off easily leaving behind a smooth shiny finish.Bottom Line - I can highly recommended Nu Finish Once A Year Car Polish!

My choice for a new garage roller seat was between this Traxion seat and "The Bone". Two things sold me on the Traxion - adjustable height and the spinning tool tray. No idea why Bone doesn't have a tool tray on their model. I do a lot of auto and motorcycle detailing and I keep all my waxes, spray shine, tire wet and chrome cleaner on the tray. No, I don't use tire shine on my cycles, only for cars. Pre-emptive strike to prevent THAT reply.Pro- Large wheels roll over the expansion cracks in my shop floor. It will NOT roll over power cords, small wrenches or even my 1/2" rubber anti-fatigue rubber stable mats i have in my shop- Wide, comfortable padded seat. I would have preferred a solid plastic seat like the Bone for longevity but this will do- Spinning tool tray is a "must have" for me for tools and other things I mentioned in the intro- Adjustable height works well, even for a 215 pound guy like me- Grab handle is nice - didn't have that on my old creeper seat - a definite improvement- Plastic tray and padded seat less likely to damage car finishes- Simple assembly as long as you have the required Torx for the wheels. I bought mine from Amazon Warehouse and it may come with a once and done Torx tool in the original packaging - someone let me know. No matter, I have a full service shop and just pulled the Torx rail out- Looks good - nice color scheme in red and black- It wheels up and down my angled driveway with easeCon- Spinning tray is chintzy - would prefer a better grade and thickness of plastic- Some spare parts are available on the Traxion website but not everything. Replacement wheels are stupid expensive at $16 each- When I grab the seat by the handle, sometimes the seat pulls right off the post no matter how hard I press it in place. Bad engineering. I installed a set screw under the seat to hold it to the seat post but Traxion really should have welded a threaded boss onto the seat themselves, sort of lame that they didn't.I bought mine from Amazon warehouse for about $90 or $25 off the current price new on Amazon. I did have to make a repair on the unit - there is a metal washer welded to the bottom of the seat plate and it was off center. I could not get the seat to fit properly on the post and the hydraulic adjustment would not work until I used a Vix bit and drilled the hole out about 30% larger. Then it was fine - I guess I know why it was on Amazon Warehouse $25 cheaper than new.See the attached photos. To the far left is a photo of the seat plate washer that I had to enlarge because the hole was off-center, too far to the right to allow the seat to fit on the seat post. I'm guessing it was early Monday morning or late Friday afternoon in China when they built the one I got. Seriously, Traxion is close to having a top rate unit here but they had some brain gas, cut corners on key details and it shows.The middle photo is of the 1/4 x 20 stainless bolt I added to hold the seat onto the pneumatic seat post. I thought I'd have to weld a 1/4" x 20 bolt onto the seat plate but there was enough metal to thread and allow the bolt to securely hold the seat in place.The final photo on the far right is the seat in it's lowest position next to a very low bobber style custom cycle to give you an idea of how low this can go when required.In summary, this seat is OK, nothing special, needs attention to some glaring details, is cheaply built in certain areas and does not quite live up to all it's claims, particularly the one about carrying it around via the seat handle - that requires user modification as I described. If this comes up again on Amazon Warehouse, read the "condition" details closely and if it says other than "new  without damage" or "new in a different box" or it is a LOT cheaper, buy it new and even then you might need to make some changes to the weak engineering on this seat.  Hope that helps! Tretiak

These lights are awesome.  Well worth the $12 I paid for them.  I purchased these lights to replace old worn out fog lights on my 2004 Jeep Wrangler.The lights were easy to install on the stock Jeep bumper.  I reused the stock wiring harness on the fog light.  I soldered the wires and used some heat shrink to insulate the connections.Just some helpful information:If your fog lights were stock like mine you will need a 1/2" socket to remove the old lights.  The new lights may require both a 1/2" socket and open end wrench.  I also had to use a small flat head screwdriver to help get the wiring harness separated.The stock wiring harness has two wires, Gray and Black on one side of the harness (from Jeep) and Blue and Black on the other side (from fog light). Gray and Blue are positive, Black on both sides is negative.

Installed these bulbs in my wife's 2013 Hyundai Accent. They are the perfect brightness. I used 4 out of the pack and they all worked.I would estimate these are in the 6000k / 350 lumen range which is about as bright as standard incandescent bulbs (maybe slightly brighter)The Philips bulb guide called for 31mm festoon. As I was installing them I had a bit of an issue with the heat sink fitting between the socket prongs. A little tweak on the prongs and  they fit. A 29mm would have been ideal all be it that is an uncommon size. I am over all happy with them.

Relatively easy to install for an amateur - most difficult part was removing the rubber hangers to lower the muffler. Definitely need a pair of helping hands to hold this heavy piece of metal while you carefully line it up with the screws to ensure you don't end up pushing them back up into the frame.Pros: Looks great, feels VERY stable, does not stick out further than the bumper.Cons: Was a tight fit on my 2015 Dodge Journey Crossroad - the center piece of the hitch is digging into my spare well cover pretty well. I have yet to lower the spare, but it seems like I will have trouble with the hitch blocking it when the time comes (see images). Finally, this is a very heavy duty hitch, adding a good amount of weight to your vehicle, but I am assuming that is to be expected with a class III hitch (apparently only CURT option available for the 2015 Crossroad).

It looks and feel solid. The mounting bracket is strong and not flimsy like the aluminum. The light is bright with a spot beam. It's not as bright as a Rigid dually. I would like to see this in a flood and/or spot combo or just flood option. Update, 2/5/17, I park my Runner outside in our recent California heavy storm. No condensation.

These were easy to install in my daughter's 2000 Lexus ES300 (with a variable valve timing engine).  Her engine has 245K + miles on it.We purchased these because my daughter's car had a P0302 engine code, which can be spark plug, engine coil , or wiring (to start).  I swapped the #2 coil with the #4 and we got P0300 and P0302 still.  I guess I still figured it must be the coil.  We replaced the coils (actually, I taught my 20 year old daughter how replace the coils) but the idle was still rough and the code was still faulting at P0302.  Turns out, in the end her spark plug in #2 was seized, and once replaced, her car runs fine now.  We still replaced all 3 engine coils in the top half of the block and all 3 spark plugs since we were at it.As far as value ... local parts store wanted $480 for all 6 engine coils and who knows what labor would be.  As far as the top half of the engine block, replacing those 3 coils is a (less than) 10 min job that ANYONE could do.  Really. All you need is a 10mm socket wrench. The back half near the firewall could prove to be more tricky as some of the air intake needs to come off to get to the coils.  We are saving that half for another project.My daughter's car runs smooth with these coils, no problems and no more engine codes.  We saved our 3 old coils, since they all ended up being 'good', that way if one of these ignition coils fails, we will have something to fall back on.  I will update if any of these fails and if you have any questions feel free to ask and I will try to help if I can.Oh, another plus ... I have a 2001 Lexus RX300, and these coils fit my SUV's engine as well.  Which is one of the reasons I bought that particular SUV after I sold the ES300 to my daughter, same engine that I was familiar with.

Oops, the last hole I took care of was the one at the hinge.  Mistake.  Start with that one first.  And install the large bag on the top row of the molle panel.  If you put significant weight in that bag, it will hang low and possibly interfere with tailgate closure.  So, it looks good and my gear is put away.  Good enough for $50.

It is my opinion that this tool is of unsafe design and potentially dangerous.The way this tool is designed, the head of the tool is forced back to the locking nut when the Schrader valve is removed.  Refrigerant gas is held in by an o-ring that seats against the shaft.However, the head is held to the shaft only by a small, relatively weak, locking pin, with no backup attachment.  On my tool, this locking pin was either too short, or sheared off during the first use --- as a result, the head separated from the shaft.  Lucky for me, this happened before I managed to remove the Schrader valve.  If this were to happen after the Schrader valve has been removed and before the ball valve had been closed, the handle and shaft would be forced out of the body of the tool at speed, and the entire contents of the AC system vented onto the user.If you own this tool, I strongly recommend you inspect the joint of your tool at the head, and consider whether you deem it safe to use.

I hate mice. Mice? Yep. Mice. A stupid mouse chewed up the plastic underneath my car all the way across the front from passenger to driver's side. There are thousands of little tooth marks. He must have been at it for hours. When he got to the driver's side he chewed on my radiator's plastic side tank until some sweet green liquid started coming out. He drank it right up and I found his little corpse under my car. Serves him right.Unfortunately for me this left me with a dilemma; pay $400 for a new radiator and spend four hours installing it myself, pay a shop nearly $1,000 for a new radiator and install, or try to repair the damage myself. After some research I found this gem of a tool and had my radiator fixed in no time. It was so quick and easy that at first I thought I'd done it wrong, and then thought that it wouldn't possibly hold, but it's hard as a rock. It came out looking like hard, dirty bubble gum, but it works. I've got over 1,000 miles on the repair and haven't had any issues at all. Amazing. So glad I found this!If you have to repair a tank holding liquid, you must drain the liquid. I couldn't get every drop out of my radiator and it was still a bit damp at repair time, but it worked just fine.This worked so well that I'm going to use this kit for any plastic welding I need.

Apparently, during the course of one week that I had this topcase, I accidentally overloaded it with a little bit too much stuff and the lock mechanism is made so cheaply that the plastic part where the lock mechanism comes down, started to come off from one end of where one of the screws goes in (SEE PICTURES).To the company who made this product: is it really that difficult to make that tiny part, steel? How difficult is it to do that? Sure, it might up the cost a bit more on this product, but it will give the consumer peace of mind as it will be harder for this product to be damaged. The lock mechanism is so cheap that it could EASILY be defeated by a thief because if a little pressure from the stuff packed in my topcase can do that, a thief would surely need a simple flat-head screwdriver to pop it open!I opted to purchase a 55-liter Givi topcase&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Givi-E55NT-Maxia-III-Monokey-Top-Case-55-Ltr-Matte-Black/dp/B0076L7522/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Givi E55NT Maxia III Monokey Top Case 55 Ltr Matte Black</a>&nbsp;and I couldn't be happier. It looks NICER too! I'm able to fit a 17.3 inch laptop inside a laptop bag and a full face helmet. Yes, I was able to do that AS WELL with this TMS topcase, but the lack of security features because of the lock mechanism is not worth the risk for me! Note: the Givi topcase costs at least $250 more ($328.00 currently but REMEMBER this is a case of "you get what you pay for!").

Almost perfect :) I was lost at the beginning of installation, easy after viewing a youtube online, piece of cake ;)Bought large to test on Honda FIT 2013 & Honda Pilot 2016 & fit well on both modelsPros:- best one so far compare to my other ones for driver seat- provide great shade in Arizona (sunny state), shades more than any other stick-on I have tried- lower temperature in car- cover 3/5 to 2/3 front windows but still leave gap for clear view to side-view mirrors- rolling up and down windows without any issueNote:- becomes too dark to see thru on at night, I do not recommend having it on at night for safer drivingCons:- must open door to take top off (especially for night driving or when stopped by police/border patrol), hopefully the future version has velcro-type connectors for easier on/off handling for day & night use

These wheels are lighter weight than traditional steelies, and look much more refined as well. They hold up great with 35s on the trail. The center caps do come off easily by hand, but I haven't had one fall off yet... looks good but yet not flashy

Good product. Good material. Nothing to complain about the product itself. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the cost. No it's not expensive but $10 is ridiculous. Oh well. $10 well spent (:

The first thing I did was verify  the red and black wire pinout and as stated on other reviews the Red and Black wires are still switched.  There's no way I could sleep knowing  that I soldered  a red and black wire together. So I popped them off and switched them all in about five minutes. I may post some pics on how to bend the pins to remove the wire from the connector if you need to switch any wires, it's really easy.Other than that it's a really great deal and I'll  definitely be buying more.Thank you.

Original window motor-brushes cracked, buying the full assembly was the most cost effective choice. These cables are not lithium greased; they will fray and mangle in the nylon sprocket, plastic cover plate, and nylon articulating surfaces. This is a high friction assembly so it will not be as fast as original AC Delco or Dorman regulators with the cable pulleys and metal sprocket and metal cover plate. This window regulator failed after about 13 months

My wife bought these for me off my Amazon wish list and so far I'm very happy with them.  The finish is very nice powder coated steel  on the tubes and the mounting brackets (not sure how long it'll hold up, but I'll update this review if anything changes).  Installation was simple and took about an hour... the product does rely on lock washers to keep everything tight, which have a tendency to back out over time, so I put some blue thread lock on as an added layer of protection.

I want to give this a 5 star but it lacks quality. It's good enough for the price I will say. The zippers arnt that great and the headrest covers don't fit at all on a 18' Colorado. The covers fit great on the seats though. Its not baggy. Good fit.

Completely engulfed in corrosion like all my other moog parts only after 1 season.  I replaced this as preventative maintenance and would throw the original one from 1999 back on if I didn't tear the rubber seal removing it.  By the way the that rusty pile of metal above the idler arm is the moog bracket that I replaced at the same time, just as rusty.

Purchased this product through the FilterWears official website.  Ended up costing the same $$ amount as on Amazon after shipping/tax.  For some reason I couldn't get Amazon to ship this pre-filer it to my address that I usually have tons of packages delivered to on the regular.  Oh well, shipped fine from their direct website.  This product fit nice & snug on my K&N CAI product# 77-9034KP.  I made sure to be careful when slipping this pre-filter on so it wouldn't rip (like others have mentioned).  Definitely seemed like it could be damaged upon installation, so beware of that & go nice and slow.  Looks good having the cool blue color in my engine bay.  I love the idea of added protection against water & dirt/mud because my 4Runner is found off road frequently.  I would def purchase this again & will prob do so in a couple years when this thing isn't water proof anymore.

Very powerful lights that produce a wider beam than the pencil type beams. These are perfect for extending your high-beam's reach for off-road driving. High-beams tend to be about 65 watts, these are nearly twice that. Rather well made they take a pretty good beating. Reasonably water tight with gaskets around the front for the lens and rear around the power cable.

Should work ok once I clean up the threads. Was not impressed as soon as I opened the case, noticed the threads on one of the bolts was completely packed with what looks like carbon and grease. I'm sure the tool will work fine, I just shouldn't have to clean the tools that are new. Ordered a used set from Amazon at the same time and they are in better condition than these.

I used this bulb in my GC SRT8 and I really liked it, comparing with 80W high quality brand I think sylvania is doing great beside the real excellent quality.Advice for who want to purchase this type, if you car tail light has a mirrored reflector these bulbs will fit and work good with you, but if you car has a polished silver reflector this bulb may not be bright as you imagine and this is because of the design of the LED Chips location which is 70% depend on the reflection.I think sylvania is the greatest brand that I used in my all cars.

Extremely nice bulbs for the price. They have that yellow color that I was looking for which was not too yellow. Trust me these do look yellow from a distance and almost have the same color as my brothers HID bulbs which I like a lot! I installed these on my Acura TSX.

**It is not necessary to buy the special crimping tool to use this. I crimped all my connections with a small needlenose pliers and then lightly soldered the connections.**This firewall plug is a must for someone wiring their car from scratch. I can now remove my entire front end without tearing it all apart. Unplug this 22 pin connector and you're done. Great product.

This is a great pair of high-quality wiper blades of specific lengths for your particular vehicle (24" and 19" in my case). They are packaged in a frustration-free, cardboard box that is fully recyclable. An illustrated instruction sheet is included to show you how to install them on your particular vehicle.These wiper blades are 3/4" wide and have a full-length, curved steel backplate enclosed in a three-part rubber/plastic housing. The housing consists of a hard plastic middle part that has a built-in adaptor for the wiper arm of your vehicle, and two heavy-duty rubber covers that run through both halves of the wiper blade. It is a frameless design in which the blade is mainly framed by two rubber sheath-like covers that don't place any restriction on the curvature of the blade as it guides across a curved windshield. Most wiper blades use an articulated rigid frame that could possibly limit the maximum curvature of the blade.The actual rubber blade tip looks like a regular rubber with no special coating or sheen to it. There is a milky, plastic V-shaped cover running the entire length of the blade for protection. A yellow circular label on it warns that it must be removed after installation. It's interesting that the manufacturer ships these wiper blades with a cover to protect the edge of the blade. I haven't seen such a cover on most other wiper blades, even the expensive ones.The plastic adaptor on the wiper blade is designed to accommodate a wide variety of wiper arms. It is compatible with the following wiper arm styles: "J" Hook-type, Top Lock Style I, Top Lock Style II, Bayonet, Side Lock and Side Pin.I'm quite pleased with the performance of these wiper blades. They guide smoothly across my windshield without skipping a bit. They are quiet and don't leave any streaks on the windshield. Essentially, they are no-frills blades, with no graphite coating or any high-tech stuff, but they work very well. At the time of writing this review, there is no pricing information yet. As such, I cannot evaluate if these are a good value. However, from the sole perspective of the build quality and performance, they are great and I would give them 5 stars.

I have no clue why there is only one review so far on this thing, and it's low?!!!So far, I have only received the hardware (XKchrome Moto Advance), and have plugged it in and tested it (as they recommend BEFORE you start getting serious on the install).Originally the unit would not sync to bluetooth (but the lights lit up when plugged in...  true to all other XKGLOW reviews I read, they were SUPER good at taking my call (an actual person answered!!! - and he answered by name...  Randy I think), and within a minute, decided the controller was a problem, and had a new one in the mail to me (shipping and tracking confirmation) with a return envelope for the defect...  I had the replacement in two days.  It worked no problem.  I strung ALL lights and extensions together to ensure all connections and hardware worked..  all did perfectly.  Then I played with the software...  I was a 50 year old man like a kid at Christmas...  so freaked out at how awesome this thing was.  I'm now playing with HOW I will wire this up and configure it on my hog, because there are so many ways it could be done...  truly flexible, and have since ordered some extras (splitters AND the signal light kit).Based on my experience with their Customer Service and the ratings at Amazon, I have NO doubt these guys will ensure I'm happy with how I end up.  This is not a cheap investment for my bike at $214, and then another $80 for extras since...  but I feel like I'm being taken care of like a gut that spend solid cash, and they seem to act like they're confident in a solid product.  I can't provide product install reviews because I'm taking my time on that part, but other Amazon reviews had no indications of prevalent hardware issues on lights...My 5 stars are based on what the product is expected to do, and do well.  And it does.  The Customer Service is the 5 star clincher - VERY important to me.  Could some things be better...  sure.  But I'm not rating them on what I wish was better...  they were awesome at answering all my questions by email as well, and super fast, and did make note of my suggestions.  This is where they might get a bit better...  a PDF manual that I can print or read through on how to use all the software capabilities, and what it can / can't do.  Mostly it's intuitive...  a couple things weren't (the cycling of lighting from the divot).Oh...  one driver for me is SAFETY...  the Red lighting when brakes are on, and orange (on either side) when signal are on is a huge plug for my decision as well.  Once you have the base controller, you can add, configure and customize 1000 differeny ways, and add items economically as you go.I will provide more feedback once in place and perhaps include pics (I'm busy so I might not get back here for a couple months)...  but all in all, I did tons of research before I took the plunge.  This is "THE" solution to give you full color controls (say to  match another item that is already a set BLUE on my bike), and tons of control options...  can't wait.Tried to leave update...  lost all my words..  hope this works.Short version...  this is a great set.  Software is capable, but would benefit from a guide.Take lots of time to plan your wiring and lighting...  draw it out, and test different spots...  sometimes the most intuitive spot or part is not the best one.  See my pics and drawings.  The red version was when I hit the brakes.

Not quite the same shape as the stainless steel pair I took off my '06 Ultra Classic and they way a little tiny bit less but they seem well made and the chrome looks good. I wonder how Harley Davidson justifies charging over five times more for theirs.

Very nice quality seat covers.  I bought these to go over the leather seats and add protection to my seats.  The steel grey color looks great and has more of a silver gunmetal look.  These ALMOST fit perfect in my car. They add a lot of extra cushion and feel great.  I have a 370z roadster and these covers took FOREVER to install!  It's not the seatcovers themselves but the way the seats are made in this particular car was very difficult to install.  I could not for the life of me get the bottom straps attached because of limited space to get under and behind the seat and all the components under the seat.  The top part of the seat was easy.  There's two straps for the headrest and one for the middle of the seat.  Once I got those attached I thought the rest would be pretty easy.  Boy was I wrong!  The bottom half of the seat is a whole different story.  On the bottom part of the seat there's two straps that go in the crease between the top and bottom seat that  I finally got  attached.  Then there's another bottom strap that goes across the middle under the seat and there was no possible way I was gonna get that strap attached unless I removed the entire seat from the car.  The last 2 bottom straps are in the front of the seat but there was no where to strap these down tight to secure them on my seats. I would assume other 2 seaters may have similar issues especially if your seats have electrical components under the seat and having limited space to work with.  I finally gave up and left the straps for the bottom half of the seat unattached and they still stay in place so far.  There is a different material that's like fleece or faux on the bottom part of the seat where it pulls down over the front of the seat where your legs don't touch if that makes sense.  Thats the only part of the seat cover that is different material.  These did not smell bad and actually had a faint new car smell to them.UPDATE:  8-20-2018.  I've been on multiple long trips and been in and out of the car numerous times.  The seat covers are still in place even without the bottom straps being used and I finally just cut the bottom straps off to get them out of the way.  They are not a 100% perfect fit for my style seats but the more they are sat in the more they conform to the seat.  I live in FL and trust me when I say these do not make you hot.  There has been no shedding onto my clothes.  They are super comfortable. I'm loving these seat covers!

The real review...Even for the price I'd expect a better qualitly.  I could see the quality as soon as i recieved them.the casting was never degated,"or cleaned up at the factory". Flash inside and out. While installing the casting that the peg is attached to broke. Seems more like potmetal than aluminium. This will also be writen to the company that makes these due to the fact that this could have broke while in the highway and my passanger could have lost there foot or worse we could both be dead. All it would have taken is a decent bump in the road for it to break off completely and their foot to fall into the chain or get ran over by the rear tire. Again don't buy from this manufacturer.

The Bulbeats 900 Lumen Super Bright LED bulb arrived very quickly from the seller.  In fact, I received a notification from Amazon shipping that there was a delay, but it arrived within typical Amazon Prime time frames.  It arrived in very profession looking packaging and was very well protected in an anti-static bag inside the box.The bulbs seem to be well-made and not super fragile.  The package states it is compatible with 921, which is the code for a 2008 Ford F-150.  Unfortunately, when I removed the old reverse light bulb and attempted to insert this bult, the base is not the same size and this does not fit into the OEM bulb socket.  It is about half the size of the OEM bulb.As much as I would love to switch these out with my factory bulbs, I cannot since they do not fit.  Therefore, I am unable to attest to the brightness or functionality of these bulbs.  I will still give this a 3-star rating, but again cannot attest to the actual functionality.I received this item at a discounted rate for my honest review.***UPDATE***Alright, assumed when they said brake light and reverse light, they were talking about your normal brake light and reverse light (tail light), not the 3rd brake light and bed light on my F-150. So, changing the 3-star rating to 5 stars. These are awesome and definitely throw off some light. Included pictures of the 3rd light reverse (bed) lights before and after and the 3rd light brake light after (sorry...forgot to get a before picture). Just removed the two screws on my 3rd light cover...popped out the old bulbs and popped in the new ones. Simple as that. These light definitely got me interested in replacing the remainder of my bulbs with LEDs...just ordered license bulb replacements from Bulbeats also. We will see how those go. Will probably replace the tail lights and front blinkers later...that'll take more work since you have to install 50W 6ohm resistors on blinkers.***UPDATE***So these are still working great in my truck...I love them. But, I have started to encounter one issue. One of the bulbs will begin to flash about once ever 1.5 seconds after it has been on for around 2 minutes. So when I have my door open and am putting my gear in my truck, by the time I am getting in, it is beginning to turn off and back on steadily about 2 seconds on and 1.5 seconds off. When I shut my door or lock my doors, shutting off the lights and turn them back on, the cycle starts all over. Wondering if it is something to do with the bulbs or my truck computer system. I would think the system if it was both bulbs, but it is just the one. I haven't tried switching them yet to see if the problem persists or switches to the other side. I will update and contact Bulbeats after I do some more testing.

Fits 2008 Audi A5 but does give a bulb error reading on dashboard. Poor output for the light but it does match the headlight LED color. Gave it a 3 star because it did the job I wanted for it to do, which was to match the color of the LED headlights. Can't hardly tell on the pictures but it really does matches the LED headlights.

Worked great for me - as usual, I did not need this silicone for the intended use (engines). I have a gas fire pit with a copper bowl (or base) and a marble outer edge.  There have always been slight gaps between the bowl and edge.  This copper colored, high heat Permatex worked great to seal the gap and give my fire pit a more finished, professional look.

Does this manufacturer think we are all foolish or something?  Sure the switches that arrived are sturdily built, function properly, and do everything a rocker switch is supposed to do (and the little rubber pope hats are a nice touch), but look at the font.The photos in this listing have apparently not been updated since 1940 (or so).  That nifty vintage-looking font on the display picture is not what was on the switches that arrived.  Sheesh.  What they chose instead (see picture) may not be comic sans, but it might as well be.  If I wanted modern(ish) looking fonts I would have, umm  well, I'm not sure what I would have done, but it would not have been ordering these.And do they really think that taking a few thousand dollars off of the price (see you save amount in other picture) will soften the impact of an uncool font?  If so, they clearly have not before dealt with a switch-savvy font aficionado.For real though, these are good sturdy switches at a good price. I've been using one of them on a piece of equipment that often gets left out in the weather. After about half a year of being exposed to weather, the switch and rubber cover are still like new.There should be three images attached to this review. (Currently Amazon seems to be having trouble processing images.)

PlastX is a very good polisher for the final step in restoring your headlights.  I prefer to use wetsanding to get the inital haze off and then finish the headlight off with this polish followed by some good sealer such as Blue Magic Headlight Sealer.  Below are pics of a set of headlights I restored on my buddy's Toyota SUV using the PlastX polisher after some wetsanding.  They now look brand new.  Be sure to use some form of sealer or wax made for headlights after polishing to keep your lights looking new long-term.  I highly recommend this product.

Took six months sitting in the honey-do pile and 6 minutes to put it up (after taking 10 minutes to read reviews and learn I was to use the existing screws of the vent to mount it)- genius - and sad that was not on the package. I hate new holes so used a 1 1/2 inch command hook to hold it open (see photo of the shape that worked). We retract it every morning so there is light after we are up - you need to reach the "button" on the side to retract it so you may want to place it facing one direction or the other so you can retract easily.  Between this in the Summer and vent pillow in the Winter we are all set.

I was contemplating whether to buy this or not due to the bad reviews on the plastic handle. It ended up working flawlessly. The build quality was better than expected and made my brake job go so much smoother. Make sure you compress the caliper slowly and it'll be fine. If it can't compress your caliper easily then chances are you need a new one or your brake reservoir cap is still on.Works great on BMW brakes. I used this on my 2008 BMW 335i rear brakes. It should work on any BMW with disk brakes, front and rear.FYI, this will not work on MKIV Jetta rear brakes or any other car with screw style calipers on the rear brakes. You need a specially tool that twists the caliper while it compresses them inward at the same time.

Used this on my 2011 Silverado 1500. It worked as described and beats buying a whole new door panel. I recommend not using superglue before installing the screws, I used a product called JB Plastic available at most automotive stores. This creates more plastic area (theoretically) and binds stronger so that the screws won't pull out of the panel again. It worked great with no flaws (no noises or clicking like some described in their review). The picture I have posted will show white areas, that is the JB Plastic that bonds to the panel and handle.

After having the original struts on my 06 Ram for 130,000 miles, it was long overdue for a replacement. Original strut forks were practically welded to the bolt and bushings on both sides the rust was so bad. After cutting them off the bushings also had to be replaced so be prepared for a headache. After installment I felt an immediate difference and much smoother ride.Only downside was purchasing them, that's why I deducted a star. For some reason the seller only allowed me to purchase one even though I need both. I couldn't even put 2 in my shopping cart. I actually ended up using two separate Amazon accounts to get them delivered as a set. Kind of a headache but well worth it in the end.

From what I read online, it's a pretty common problem with VWs to have your resistor go, so the heat & AC will only work on setting 4 (full blast). I like it on 2 or 3 so it's not too loud. I was hesitant to buy a part made in China, since my VW is fussy and prefers German-made parts. But with OEM going for $48, I figured $7 was worth a try. This Chinese aftermarket part looks like the real deal. It was easy to install (I watched Youtube vids to figure it out). Now all settings of AC & heat work again. I do notice a slightly odd scent from the AC vents, which I'm not sure is due to this new part. I will post at a later time with updates, as I acquire new info on how it performs. For now, though, I am happy, and so is my car baby!

Update 4/10/2017: Fram has changed the filter to be less rigid, they have removed 2 of the sides that keep the filters firm. Left is the new filter and right is the filter I purchased a couple of months ago. You can tell they removed the side peices that keeps them from bending inside the hvac system. I'll update the review in a few months to see if this change makes these filters worse or notWell it is a cabin air filter. This went into my 2005 Toyota Corolla. I replace mine about 3 or so times a year. Fitment is just fine, doesn't seem to leave any gaps. Air flow comes in from below the windshield DOWN to the blower. But overall I like the carbon impregnated filters because I live in an area with lots of farms and pollen, and the filter helps quite a bit.

I ride in below freezing temperatures every winter so every bit of relief helps and these do work to keep some of the wind off your knees. I do notice a differance when I get off the bike, mainly that my knees aren't numb like they used to be. This won't keep you warm and toasty but it will save your knees ocasionally from the gravel truck and will cut back on the chill for those of us who ride in the colder elements. One Major Thing to keep in mind is that you will need to buy brackets to mount these that cost 120ish bucks. FYI. Once I got the brackets it mounted easy without any moding.

Dont get me wrong, whelens are top tier but you pay top dollar too. These are not going to be used for emergency,  mainly recreational use and it is bright and easy to wire. I loke the feel of the housing,  it comes with a rubber backing for mounting,  and has two screws included. The housing lets you mount directly to the side of your vehicle or whatever..or you need to buy a seperate mounting bracket. (Fyi i used a lens tint paint to smoke the lenses for "ninja look". Once again, recreational use)

Fits MK7 GTI almost perfectly.  I love the fact that Audi A3/S3 products fit Golfs (MQB Platform - 2015-2018 as of this review, I have 2017).  I uploaded pics to see the fit.  The ones thats are a little exposed are the Front Passenger mat (upper right portion) and maybe a little bit of the top of the aluminum foot rest on the driver side.  If you or your passenger step into your car with dirty/wet/salty shoes, these areas could get dirty.  In my opinion, this is not a deal breaker.  Coverage is still excellent.The mat is cupped around which should prevent liquid spills from doing serious damage (note, liquids probably will penetrate the front mats button/clip area but this area is cupped too so only if the liquid lands on top of the button.  The button/clip doesn't feel as solid as the VW OEM mats do.  (Again, not a deal killer for me).  It is possible the Audi buttons are a little different.Compared to the GTI VW Monster mats, these are alot thinner and look more cloth like.  Think of cloth with a slightly rubbery feel.  These cover alot better than the VW OEM Monster mats which are flat.Glad I got these over Weathertech's which have a slippery plastic feel and an annoying (to me) tapping sound against shoes.  The cloth/fiberous feel to these are better.Personally, I like these on many levels.  Looks, feel, quality are pluses.  It would be perfect if the oem button clips were on it, the coverage was just a little better in the areas noted above and had a GTI logo on it (hmm, these are advertised for A3/S3's... Maybe not).

This is a perfect fit for my Cyclone Mustang. I didn't want a cold air intake with the open cone style filter. So I purchased this and the aFe 31-80179 Direct Fit Inverted Replacement Filter for my factory cold air intake box. I installed both at the same time. This intake tube looks much better than the factory one and doesn't take up as much room in the engine bay. The car sounds better and has a little more pep in it's step.

OK for the price you pay. The directions are not that great, You have to match quanity of parts you have by number on directions. No pictures for parts. The pictures for assembly are awful!! I sorta knew this was coming but didn't think it would be this bad.. I went in the house and watched a youtube video on how to install westin step bars or nerf bars. The video helped a lot.  This kit does come with some extra brackets for certain years trucks in case you need them. One thing I noticed after removing all parts that this kit does not include a center bracket to mount to center of nerf bars for stability. I thought this might be a problem but after installing all brackets and mounting the bars and tightening everything up I was surprised how sturdy it was. So I guess you don't need the center brace. One thing less to rust anyway. The tubing seems thin but the price reflects that I suppose. It does look pretty good installed. I have the black painted nerf bars.. Not the stainless by the way.  One thing I did to slow down the rust is silicone all around the round tubing where it meets the bracket. And silicone the hole at the mounting bolts to the round tube.

I had a small hole show up in my leather love seat and still don't know how it got there. Must have had a screw driver in my hip pocket or something. The hole was about the size that would be made by a large flat bladed screwdriver, and showed signs of growing larger, as it was in the middle of the place I usually sit in the evenings. I tried the usual leather repair products to no avail; after a few days they tore out and the hole grew a bit bigger. I thought of sewing it together, but that would have not only looked terrible, I'm not sure it would have lasted as the leather is quite thin. Seeing this on Amazon led me to try it, as I love superglue, which is an incredible product. I squirted the mender directly into the hole, then on top of it. Finally, I smoothed it out a little and left it alone for 24 hours. As promised, it fixed the hole, with a new layer of vinyl. Yep, it is easy to see (not as easy as the photo, but easy nevertheless). But it is a whole lot better than the hole, and the repair is tough. I recommend you color any tear you wish to repair before you use this product, because the color of the tear will show through the clear vinyl. Thumbs up for this great repair product!

This product is a great bang for your buck.  It's been 4 or 5 months since I bought this product and it still looks like I put it on yesterday. I did have trouble with the areas that I was more meticulous (slower) it resulted in Tiny Bubbles and when I was more quick with the application it turned out flawlessly.  Take it for what its worth.  I highly recommend this product.  Watch a video or two on how to apply it.  I used a credit card as a squeegee.  It worked great.

3-24-18.  Installed today and so far impressed. Good grade bolts and well built brackets.  Word of caution the small bolts, which connect the steps to the brackets, will shear off with to much force.I bought to tighten up the steps to the body vs factory, these do that well.

I bought this product off the official Rough Country website. It was on sale for $79.95. They removed my review as it was discrediting their product. here it is as posted before:Works for what it is. Although, I'm fairly disappointed with Rough Country when comparing it to their other products, and one of my friends eBay knock offs.First off, it is a well built mount. The steel is thick and more than adequate for supporting a 50" lightbar. But, the positives end there. The welds are shoddy at best. The powder coating is a nice touch, but seems lightly applied. The mounts leave an air gap between the windshield frame. It doesn't sit flush against the frame. So, even when installed correctly, it still looks "off."Now, in comparison to one of my buddies that own an RC light bar mounting kit for his TJ, the YJ one doesn't even compare. The quality control with the welds on the TJ version seemed amazing. Also, the RC logo was stamped on top of the mount. So it had branding on it. The YJ one does not. And looks generic.Speaking of being generic, my buddy bought an eBay special mounting kit, and hilariously enough, it seemed just on par with the RC mount. Since both of them have no branding anywhere to be found, you couldn't tell which was which. The quality was about the same of the RC one, but when the RC one is not on sale, it would personally be a better option for $40 less. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Solid-Steel-50-Straight-LED-Light-Bar-Mount-Brackets-For-Jeep-YJ-Wrangler-87-95-/181957091967?hash=item2a5d7ce27f:g:4poAAOSwwE5WaPOh&vxp=mtrAlso, if you're running KC daylighters or any other after market windshield lights, you have to ditch them. The other mounts will not piggyback over the RC mounts. I had to saw off some the RC mounts elbow to fit my KC lights in flush, so I could run both. It's doable, but requires extensive modification and RC doesn't even warn you that it's incompatible with any other mounting solutions.Although, if you are just wanting to run a light bar only, and could overlook the minor inconveniences, the light bar mount does exactly as it should. It will perfectly fit a 50" bar. Now, make sure when you order a light bar its 50" FROM END TO END of the BAR ITSELF. NOT including the mounts. I'll link the light bar I used, it fit perfectly. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NAQUJ34?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_8

Awesome bars, love the height. 02 Electra Glide, some say they fit without changing cables and lines. My brake lines had to be extended, but the throttle cables do reach.  I have a hydraulic clutch, which had ample length. I would assume the clutch cable would need to be extended as well.

Great design! Looks fantastic, built very well and fits perfect. I just installed these yesterday and though it is a bit of work to wrestle the factory roll cage cross bar where they mount to, I was able to do this by myself. They look so good and are totally out of the way of anything else. I could not be happier with these. Just as a note, I had to cut a very small notch in the factory plastic top piece this made it sit up a tad bit higher, which I wanted and it is not noticeable at all. Just an FYI... In the picture they have a double row light bar, but I prefer a single row light bar, so that is what  I installed and it looks outstanding and fit is perfect with either a single or double row light bar.

Update October 25th. Well I finally got total to someone at maxxair today. I called and pressed 1 for the technician help line. He was very helpful. Asked me about the voltages at the fan so I had to do some testing. The control board is replaceable so after asking me some questions he agreed to send me out a new control board. I gave him my name and address and he said it was in the way. So I'm hopeful I'll be able to get my fan fixed.Update October 23,2016.Well the camper has been out in 2 camping trips and this fan has failed. I was sleeping one night when it was 31 degrees out. Woke up to the fan running. The fan had turned itself on, opened the dome, and was running at full speed. I quickly tried to shut it off. Neither the remote or the controls on the fan would shut it off. I finally pulled the fuse and closed it manually. Up on reinserting the fuse after a few minutes the fan reset and worked briefly, then died all together. It now does not work. It's too late to return through Amazon. Supposedly it's covered under a 2 year warranty. So I called the number on the manufacturer website for warranty repair. Waited on hold for nearly an hour to get a recording asking me to leave a message. Then I found a spot on their website where you can submit a warranty request electronically. I did that and have not heard from them. This fan cost over $260 and failed after 2 trips. And at present is broken with no support from the manufacturer. It worked great until it died. Now it's just a useless bump on the roof. I sincerely hope they come through. What good is a 2 year warranty if no one answers the phone or replies to the online warranty requests. I'm very disappointed at this point.Installs pretty easy. Cut the hole. Install the flange. Drop in the fan. Tighten the screws. I even managed to get it to work in a slightly curved roof. The flange flexed just enough to get a good looking installation. It's very quiet. Doesn't move as much air as I thought it would. But it works well. I like it far better than the fantastic fan models.

Upon first use, the pin bent a little bit.  Not the end of the world, but I was disappointed.  All in all, I pressed out two rivets successfully.  Upon peening the rivets on the new master link, the peening attachment shattered on the first rivet.  Pieces of it shot wildly around the garage.  I only recovered two of three pieces.  It seems that the design of this attachment is just too small and weak for the job.I'm sending it back for a refund tomorrow and trying the Motion pro Jumbo next.  Wish me luck!I've seen a few mentions of a failed drive bolt.  It doesn't say this in the instructions, but the threads of the bolt need to be lubricated prior to use.  Any type of oil or anti-sieze will do.  Reducing friction at the threads will reduce the amount of force needed, which will probably save the drive bolt every time.

You can't beat this for the price!Gone are the days of me going to the local parts store to get raped for a small can of oil and some degreaser.I use a spice/mustard type bottle to apply it.  The bottle top allows for a more restrictive opening so it's not poring out. For smaller applications I use a non medical syringe.I used this oil on a non-K&N filter, but it was indeed, a gauze cotton filter.  For a degreaser I used a 50/50 mix of Purple Power and water.

Extremely easy to install. All completely plug and play. Canbus ballast are incredibly small so you able to find a nice place to tuck them away. Installation took me about a hour once I decided how I was going to hide the ballasts. Have had them in for 2 weeks now and have no issues at all.Any change and I will update.UPDATEIt has been a couple of months. One of the lights doesn't come on all the time. When you unlock the vehicle the lights come on. At first they both did and now one never does. When you turn the headlights on sometimes that particular one comes on right away and sometimes you have to turn the headlight switch a few times for it to turn on. Installed the relay and still no change. Plus the relay hummed extremely loud when I turned the lights on. Had to remove.Update 9/2016.Continued to have the same issue with the headlights. Contacted Opt7 about it they had me switch everything from the divers side to the passenger side to see if the problem is in the bulb or the ballast. Still had the same issue. A day after putting it all back to the way it was the drivers side stopped working.Getting more frustrated with the kit I asked them for a refund. Can not use something that only works half the time. They informed me that I was 3 days past the refund period so they could not process the refund.I would not buy.

For a beginner grease monkey, I highly value this equipment.  I no longer have to go to a quick lube establishment to ask them to read my engine code for free then have to deal with their sales pitches.  This unit resets the engine code and also tells me what is wrong.  I can look at the code then begin to figure out what is wrong with my car.  I did receive this product at a discount for an honest review, but I can honestly say no car guy can be without an engine code reader.  There are fancier versions that have bluetooth but for a simple tool this is great!

Nice bright LED light, programmable to any color you can imagine. Quality connectors and plenty of extension cable to get it under the vehicle. The remotes are RF, not IR, so you can place the controller almost anywhere and the remotes will communicate. This really attracts people at car shows. Problems: In this and the other OPT7 kit I have, the button battery provided with the kit needed to be replaced before the credit card remote worked properly. And the mounting hole at one end of each light stick is covered by its wire, so be careful putting a screw through there. But OPT7 customer service was great! Now how do I get a poster of the promotional image for my garage?

All I can say regarding these bulbs is wow. I'm using them for my front marker lights. They are extremely bright and make it incredibly easy for other drivers to see the front sides of my car. The construction of these bulbs are much better than most 194 bulbs out there. They're solid and I'm not afraid of pushing them into the socket or pulling them out like I might be with more cheaply made bulbs. LUYED is awesome and I'm really loving their products. I hope they keep up the amazing work. Oh and I find it important to mention that their bulbs all come packed inside an antistatic zip bag which is placed nicely in a really cool padded and fancy black box.Please be advised I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review. All of my reviews are strictly my thoughts and opinions. My goal is to help other customers make the best decision for what they're shopping for. None of my statements are biased or untrue.

My Vehicle - 2014 Toyota 4Runner Trail (Magnetic Grey Metallic)I bought this Thule 859 Canyon Roof Mount Cargo Basket to supplement the Pro Series rear receiver mounted cargo basket I already have.When I had my Tundra space was not an issue. Now with 3 adults going on vacation to the beach for a week, and with 2 of them being women, the inside of the 4Runner can get a little cramped. Now, I didn't do a trial run to determine if I needed a roof mounted cargo basket but just figured it would be nice to be ready in case. Also, I would prefer not to take the rear mounted basket if it's not needed. Simply because it is very large, and very heavy and even though it folds up, it can still be a nuisance.Unless your vehicle comes with roof rail cross member, you will need to buy those too. Toyota 4Runners do not come with them from the factory. Hmmm. Fortunately I found some on eBay that were supposed to be used, but wound up being new, and were half as much as anywhere else on the internet, and 4 times less than buying them from the dealer.The Thule 859 Canyon Roof Basket mounted to the OEM 4Runner roof rails with no problem. It comes with 3 different sized U shaped bolts for various thickness flat cross members (I used the smallest), and it comes with two different bolt down set-ups for slotted cross member. So they definitely have just about every type of cross member covered.I did do some personal modifications to things though. Since I used the provided U shaped mounting bolts I added some 1/4" dia. clear fuel line hose to keep them from damaging the underside of the cross members, and to help make the contact more grippy. I also added some foam rubber weather stripping to the underside of the metal brackets, and to the underside of the basket tubes where they came into contact with the cross members to keep from scratching the tops of the cross members. You don't have to do any of this. I am just OCD and anal about certain things.The brackets and those thumb style triangular nuts are all covered by a plastic cover and makes everything invisible and very clean looking. I like how the U bolts in the brackets can be loosened by hand and the entire basket can be removed without any tools at all. That is to say, as long as you are tall enough to get it off the roof by yourself. For that, and for loading the basket, I was going to get one of those tire mounted steps. I have a folding leg platform I bought to paint the inside of my house with and thought, its aluminum and lightweight, folds up, somewhat compact, and when unfolded stands 18 tall.  This platform is absolutely perfect for getting up on the roof to load/unload cargo! I have to recommend one of these if your vehicle is taller than you can reach.Ok, so installation took me about 2 hours in 90ish degree weather and I needed help getting the basket onto the roof. I recommend that you leave everything loose (all the nuts and bolts) until you have the basket up on the rails to make sure you can tweak things perfectly. When I was done and everything was tightened down I grabbed the roof basket and shook it until the entire vehicle was rocking. Not a squeak, strain or groan from the basket. It feels like it is part of the vehicle and only your cross members and roof rails will limit how much weight this thing will hold.It is rock solid and built to last a lifetime. All the welds are professionally done. Very clean. Most roof racks come in two pieces and so does this one but Thule went the extra mile here too by adding a flat round blank (basically, a piece of metal about the size and shape of a quarter/coin) inside the tubes where the joints are that I suppose keeps water from getting inside the tubes and ultimately leading to premature rust through. In my search for a roof rack, I actually read about problems like this with some racks. I added a bead of clear silicone inside the tubes anyway, but I probably didn't need to.The package, sold by FlyMotorsports, arrived in record time well ahead of the stated date. By almost a week. So that was really nice, since the cross members arrived the day before. I was able, thanks to FlyMotorsports, to install everything in the same weekend. I would buy from them again in a heartbeat based on this alone.Ok, so the Rob test......I took the 4Runner out and had to push the limit. At all speeds up to, and including 80 (ish +) there was not a single whistle or vibration. Yes, you can hear the wind rushing around the rack but if you are talking with the radio off you would not even notice. Turn on the radio at even the lowest volume and "what noise?".  Of course not every vehicle will be the same and it sits closer to the back of the roof on the 4Runner and I don't have sun roof, but I did have all my windows down and the noise of the wind from that is louder than the wind noise from the rack. You can only hear it when all the windows are up and no one is talking or the radio is off.I would have to say I looked at every possible option and had it narrowed down to less than a handful. The unique design, cost, and reputation of Thule are what swayed me in this direction and I do not regret it at all. For the money, and for what you get, the Thule 859 Canyon Roof Basket looks great, and doesn't look like all the other roof mounted baskets you see. It functions as it's supposed to, and should last for many years. I am very happy with this decision.I bought the Keeper 07203-1 Waterproof Roof Top Cargo Bag (15 Cubic Feet) here on amazon to throw things in I want to keep dry on trips because the price was right, and the size is perfect for this basket.I also bought the Thule 692 Roof Rack Mount Cargo Basket Net here on Amazon when the Keeper bag is not full to help keep it from flapping around in the wind. And for when I want to throw things up there without the bag.I feel like I am now prepared for any trip, no matter how many suitcases the women say they need to bring, LOL.Rob

This LED headlight by Eagle Lights is hands down one of the best investments I've made for my bike. Installation was a snap. I used this on my 2016 Softail Slim S. It is a direct plug and play application for this bike, you don't need any other adapter or harness, as the light will plug directly into the bikes connector. It puts out significantly more light than the stock bulb. I haven't tried it out at night yet, but the difference in my dark garage at night is huge! See and be seen with one of these bad boys. Another plus is the price point, at around $300.00 less than the HD Daymaker! I've heard that this company makes the Daymaker for Harley, but I don't know how accurate that is.Update: 11/12/16: I took a night ride with the Eagle Lights LED, huge difference over stock. I can actually see the road now. I was really uncomfortable riding at night with the stock bulb, but not at all with this LED.

I got this for the aluminum utility trailer I bought. I like it. It's roomy, well designed and constructed and much less expensive than the aluminum tongue boxes I was considering.The A-frame on my trailer is not 'flat' so I constructed a bracket out of 2" aluminum angle stock. I also put some simple weatherstripping along the edge of the lid to reduce the likelihood of water and dust getting in; I'm pretty sure that's going to work, considering the generous 'lip' on the lid / box interface.

Overall the mat is very grippy and plenty thick so it solves my sliding gear issue. It should take a good amount of abuse. What imperfections are there shouldn't be noticeable after getting scuffed and worn. The mat I got was nowhere near as bad as others have reviewed. Just a few small lumps and uneven surface textures in areas. Not really noticeable from a distance. -1 star because it isn't perfect, as most people would normally expect from a Toyota product.

This is the perfect combination for both my electric start motocross bike and my jeep. It comes with two separate attachments that allows me to leave one hooked directly to my FC450's battery and the other so I can use on any other batteries.During the offseason my bikes battery usually dies if I don't start it often. So after using one of these on my R6 this one will keep my bikes battery dialed in so it will start every time.I also like that it has the "jumper cable" option so I can use it on my jeep on nights after I install things that may drain the battery. This is kind of a backup in case I have a slow drain somewhere.If you're on the fence just pick one up. It's cheap insurance and well worth your time.

Usually these come with no instructions and beat up packaging leaving you to fend for yourself. As you can see it came packaged extremely well and came with not only mounting hardware, but a long wiring harness ready to go and most importantly instructions that you can read.What I also like about this light bar in particular is that it's the perfect size and brightness to put in a lower location so that you can actually use it on the trails when you're following people. I'm going to mount this to our bumper or make it work behind the grill so that it's not shining directly into someone's rear view mirror like most roof mounted lights do. You can obviously mount it there also but for my needs this is perfect. Especially for the price!

The Bosch filter is very sturdy and made of high quality material.  Used synthetic oil with this filter and my RX300 runs smooth.I didn't have to jack up the RX300 to drain the oil and change the filter.  The oil drain plug is very easy to access from the front passenger side, but the oil filter is very difficult to access and is mounted horizontally.  Used plenty of paper towels and accessed it from the top.  Was able to hand twist the old filter off and put the new one in a few minutes.Used the following synthetic oil.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/MAG1-61790-pk6-Full-Synthetic-5W30-SM-Motor-Oil-32-oz-Pack-of-6/dp/B006P0WNMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">MAG1 61790-pk6 Full Synthetic 5W30 SM Motor Oil - 32 oz., (Pack of 6)</a>

Purchased these for my 2005 Audi A6 Quattro which has light beige interior carpeting that you see everything on...First thing I noticed was no rubber smell. Yay! :)They're not very heavy but appear solid.They're flexible which is nice because it means they better conform to the floor you're putting them on.I trimmed two corners, upper and lower left to create the space needed for my driver's side floor. Didn't cut anything from the passenger side's mat. For now I placed them over top of the original carpet mats. So far nothing has moved, they are wedged in and grippy from the underside.The star deduction: The color says "beige" and lighter would have been nice but they're really more of a light brown - a bit darker even than the photos.There is no *perfect* fit to be had here but for a non-Audi "generic" mat, these are pretty good and they'll help me keep the dirt out at a decent price. We'll see how they hold up over time.I'll let the photos speak for themselves.

The Good:1. Looks great2. Seems very tough3. Great price ($80 cheaper than other retailers)4. Arrived ahead of schedule5. Can be installed at home (with the right tools)The Bad:1. 117 lbs or about 93 lbs more than stock2. Mine was missing some hardware while having extra brackets, nuts and screws without explanation how to use them.3. An oversimplified wiring diagram with no directions on how to mount the included LED lights or utilize the above hardware if you already have a towing package wiring harness. Hint: install lights in the bumper before mounting the bumper to the vehicle. You'd think since this was made specifically for the Jeep Wrangler the wiring instructions would tell you exactly which wires to splice into on the factory brake/reverse light harness.4. The installation problems can be overcome. But it more than doubled my install time due to less than stellar instructions and missing hardware that had to be purchased after I had already put down $517 to start with. Maybe a small annoyance compared to the big picture. But for this kind of money I expect the best.

This stuff is amazing. i actually dilute it slightly because its so costly but I use it everyday on my car as a quick detail spray. My paint is always slick. Make sure to use a good high quality micro fiber towel to prevent swirls or marring on the paint.

I've had the lights now for a couple of weeks and they are a great replacement over the stock bulbs on my F-150! They are slightly brighter than stock and they are simple to install. I was expecting a slightly "whiter" light but all in all they are a great replacement. The reason why I give these bulbs 5 stars is because of the packaging and attention to detail in making sure you get everything you need to safely and efficiently remove your old bulbs and install these ones. The bulbs arrived in a nice, sturdy, clear-plastic case inside of a cardboard box. Inside the case you have:2 - H13/9008 Replacement Bulbs1 Pair of rubber gloves1 Packet of Silicone Grease1 "HELLA" sticker and 1 HELLA booklet showing you their other products.I was very impressed by the shipping that it took it over the top for me. I would definitely recommend these bulbs to anyone who is looking to replace their burned out lights and you can rest assured they will arrive in perfect condition.

I opted to buy one that was previously opened from Amazon Warehouse Deals. Item was in like new condition and I saved $20. I will start by saying that I'm not sure that I would put 500 pounds on this thing but definitely would trust it to carry 200 or 300 pounds. Both bikes that I am carrying have a combined weight of 62 pounds. This thing is solid and has the standard amount of hitch slop but this is corrected if you use a StowAway Hitch Tightener <http://www.amazon.com/StowAway-Cargo-Carriers-20-6-Tightener/dp/B0001CMUV4?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01>.I was looking for a light weight Cargo Carrier to build a bike rack on. I wanted something that could carry two bikes with ease but I also wanted dual purpose. I didn't just want a bike rack or I wouldn't have bothered with this project. This thing is light but leaves you confident that your bikes will not come off on a rough 4x4 road. The two bikes that I am carrying on this thing would cost me over $6,000 to replace. That being said, the total investment on this project was totally worth it. I have about $270 total in this custom rack and I don't have to worry about my bikes coming off or hitting each other going down rough roads. The cool thing is that this is still a very functional cargo carrier too! Total weight after build is around 30 pounds.If you decide to build something like this, make sure to use nylon locking nuts and Loctite blue on all bolts. I also had to build the rack closest to the vehicle over a few inches to keep the bars away from my camper. That meant that I also had to move over the locking mechanism too. You probably wouldn't need to do this on a smaller car or wagon. I plan on making another one for my Girlfriend's Outback.

This pencil-type tire gauge was designed to be used for both car tires (low pressures) and bicycle tires (high pressures). Versatility is good, right? Actually, not so much if you plan to use this for your car. The problem is that the indicator stick has to encompass the whole pressure range from 20-120 PSI, rather than the usual 5-50 PSI range for gauges designed just for car tires. This means that the stick barely extends a centimeter for a pressure of 30 PSI (see photo). Thus, it's nearly impossible to read the gauge more accurately than +/- 3 PSI.

These fit my 2016 F150 perfectly and were very easy to install. I debated between these and the WeatherTech mats, which my wife has and loves. I decided to try the Husky Liners because Amazon briefly had them on sale and even had a 10% off coupon in addition.I am very happy with the decision. The mats seem very sturdy and they have a lifetime warranty (compared to WeatherTech's three warranty).If you are debating between the two, I don't think you can go wrong with either.  Both are very high quality, American made products.

I would put zero stars if possible. These were advertised as waterproof and shock resistant, but after opening the box it was obvious that they are straight up lying. All the 5 star reviews are bogus and very generic. Stay away and spend your money elsewhere. You would be better off with something cheap from harbor freight tools. I removed the cover and took pictures. There are no gaskets and it's made with very cheap metal. Buyer beware!!

There is NO WAY this Extang product seals the tailgate on a 2015 Ford F-150 XL. My truck is a Styleside version which is pretty standard. The Extang will seal the bottom of the tailgate, however the sides of this tailgate are much, much, much too wide at both the top and bottom for this narrow thickness seal to close the opening. As you can see in the photo, the gap between the tailgate and the truck bed is NOT uniform but widens at both the top and bottom. ABSOLUTELY NO WAY this product can seal the opening. If anyone knows a better solution....please let me know as I really want to seal my 2015 F-150 tailgate. I have to return my purchase to Amazon.

It just amazes me that these camper cover sellers don't post the simple fit diagram or dimensions in the ad.  This is the second one I've bought (not the same vendor) and they are very vague about how they fit for truck campers.  Here is my photo of the box guide, so maybe the rest of you buyers can finally have a shot at getting what you need..  I have an Alaskan Camper, which is an odd pop-up truck camper in the first place, so I don't expect any cover to fit very well.  I lucked out and got the one that was the closest for what I needed (the red dot indicates which one). I may go ahead and sew some folds under permanently, like I did for a previous cover (for a previous camper). Good part:  Material is okay, though a bit soft.  If I cover some camper corners with thin rubber, it should not tear (an exercise mat from Goodwill, cut up, works great).  It will not be "waterproof" but will shed water off, which is good enough for me.  A nice thing for the seller is that they did include a photo of the 45771, the one I purchased.  There are lots of straps to pull it in.The box is not that heavy, but USPS will require you to sign for it and not leave it at the door by default. Just be ready for that issue to come up.The last good thing:  This is an inexpensive purchase.  It is more than 1/2 the price of the next comparable cover.  If it lasts only half as long as the next expensive one, so what?  Buy it again.

I regularly waxy my Car using Meguiar's Car Wax and let me tell you that it is a wonderful product - it keeps my car shiny, neat till the next wash.  And the best part about Meguiar's car was is that water beads - does not stick to the surface.This product behaves exactly like the wax - but what the company claims is that it will last longer - it has been about a week since I applied this and I have to see how long it lasts.Overall - I am impressed by the product.

I bought this for my 2014 Altima. Perfect fit! See the before and after. I'm not sure this has ever been changed so definitely worth the money. I followed some of the reviews about removing your glove box, which I did. But I found out after i installed it that I could have done it without removing the glove box. You have to reach all the way behind and there is a slim black cover that you remove and you get access to the filter. Even though I removed the glove box, the whole install took about 35 min.

I noticed that some of the reviews were good, so I ordered this item, but once I got it connected it was only putting out 94 volts. I am not sure if this is a signal of a faulty unit or if it is supposed to be under a higher load to produce more voltage. I am not satisfied with this unit; therefore, I will possibly return it.I connected the inverter straight to the battery using #2 awg cable and terminal connectors. The distance between the inverter and the battery is less than 10', which provides sufficient voltage with limited voltage drop to the inverter. The extension cord I was using during the test was a 3 conductor 12; The items I tested on the inverter were a 55" TV, a 10" fan, and a lamp. At this point the output voltage dropped to 93.1UODATE 9/9/2017:  After much review and study, I have found that you are correct, a conventional meter does not read a modified sine-wave inverter correctly and the expected voltage from the conventional meter should be between 90 and 100 volts. My conclusion with this new information is that there is nothing wrong with the inverter you sent me.

The boards are a great fit on my 2015 RAM 2500 and I like how sturdy they are.  A word of warning for those who live in areas with salty roads in the winter.  After 1 month of Maine winter I'm seeing surface rust on the mounts and the aluminum finish is taking a beating.  The attached photo shows the rear facing side of front passenger side mount.  I wash my truck (including undercarriage) at least once per week so I was a little disappointed to see the rust after 1 month.  Had a known I would have treated mounts with a product like Fluid Film and I would have applied a wax finish to the aluminum.** Update September 2016 **  After 8 months the bolts and brackets are all heavily rusted.  Once again, I wash the undercarriage of my truck weekly during winter months and monthly during the summer.  This weekend I spent several hours cleaning up the brackets / bolts and applying POR 15 just so I can get another year or two out of these boards.  Unless product quality improves I cannot recommend these boards.

Had to drill out the bar end of my bike a little to mount these. There were previously screw in bar ends. The aluminum is nice and they hold their position well. The glass is slightly convex and give you an ok view, everything is gonna look smaller and further away. Only complaint is the edge of the mirror/glass is not cleanly cut and you can see the slightly rough edge. They can be mounted upside down also.

I bought these to do some trail riding after dark when it gets too hot out in the summer. Attached them to an aluminum flat bar and mounted that to my handguards. Tapped into the high beam indicator with some quick disconnects. With a 3600 lumen headlight bulb, these auxiliary lights and a 5000 lumen headlamp I am good to go anywhere after dark. Haven't tested the durability, but at $16/pair I can replace them every year.

I am a girly girl and love anything pink.  I drive a little white Mazda3 that I love but that is not very girly looking.  I put little pink caps on the tire valves but that was about it.  Until now.  I do want to make it clear that while I love pink, I would never pick color over performance.  I have high expectations of any wiper blade I put on my car and would never tolerate anything but the best.  I drive close to 30,000 miles a year in this car, and as such visibility is incredibly important to me.That said, these wiper blades fit perfectly, were incredibly easy to put on, and work as good as (if not better) than the ones that came with my car. I look forward to using them in the winter time as they should have less ice built up than my old ones.  I will continue to use these and evaluate them in various weather conditions and update this review as needed.I received a free sample of these wiper blades in exchange for my review.  I rate them an easy 5 stars based on my experience with them so far.  I will come back and update my review after using them through the various seasons.

Mirror quality seems to be okay as received but when I tried to install the mirrors on my truck one of them stalled fine, but the other one, after pressing on it for 30 seconds to hold it in place cracked. So I had to use another mirror of the 4 to install the mirror again with the remaining quantity of mirrors and it then mounted okay. But now I'm short a mirror which I was going to install the other pair on my golf cart windshield. Also be aware that the double stick foam backing sticks out from the Mirror by about 2 mm so it really is not a flat flush mount.

Used this product to seal the oil pan on a 2003 Infiniti G35 Coupe - worked like a charm, no leaks yet. Followed instructions per factory service manual for loosening/tightening order and appropriate torque specifications.UPDATE: noticed that using factory torque spec actually causes the oil pan to deform a bit. Suggest cutting the suggested torque specs in half when using this type of gasket.

Used these as side marker lights after one of the incandescent bulbs blew. They are a great upgrade, much brighter than the factory bulbs and should last much longer. They project a brilliant white color that perfectly matches my L.E.D headlights.Installation:Very simple, pop out the old bulbs and squeeze in these L.E.D.s. You might have to put a bit of umph into it though as they are slightly more robust than the bulbs they replace, but they will still fit and more securely at that. These are at least 10x brighter than the bulbs they replaced and put out a really nice clean pure white light. As they are L.E.D they should last for many years.For my application they were error free and worked *almost* immediately.F.Y.I: These are polarity sensitive, so if they don't light up simply pull out and flip them, they will light up then.

I replaced the OEM transmission cooler with this unit on my '99 Sierra 1500 (GMT800). Many people choose to go with a Tru-Cool 40k unit, but since I rarely tow, I went with the Tru-Cool 28k. The 28k (24,000 BTU) is easily twice the size of the OEM tranny cooler, and consistently keeps transmission temps ~20* lower than before. I am using Torque Pro to monitor temperatures.Transmission Fluid Temp Test (60* ambient):OEM Cooler: 150*Tru-Cool 28k: 130*If you have a factory GM transmission cooler, the fluid path goes from Transmission > Radiator > Trans Cooler > Transmission. Some people elect to bypass the radiator for more cooling, but I did not. Transmission fluid is heated as it passes through the radiator, essentially removing the need for an external thermal bypass. We have a few brisk days of cold weather here in Colorado, and I didn't want to have to worry about over-cooling the transmission fluid. I wanted something that would keep the transmission cool, but not too cool. This is another reason I didn't chose the 40k cooler. If I lived in an area that rarely saw freezing weather -OR- if I had a vehicle that is known to internally fail, thus causing transmission fluid and coolant to mix... I would bypass the radiator.Install was very easy on my Sierra. The original transmission cooler lines are 3/8", and I had no issue with the 11/32" on this cooler (that's a whopping 1/32" difference - don't stress over it). The kit comes with everything you need; however, I wasn't aware of all the fittings in the kit before ordering, so I used the Hayden 397 fitting (I honestly may not have needed this fitting, but wanted to be sure I had no snags during installation). The included transmission hose was also of sufficient length. As minor as it may be, I also much preferred the black color of the 28k over the 40k.

Looks and installation instructions are top notch, but after having light installed for 16 months, one of the red and white LED's have went out. Beware of the return policy that states you must ship defective item back prior to them shipping new. Keep your packaging for the entire warranty period as the cost of a package and return shipping will not be cost effective when removing, packaging, shipping AND re-installation is considered

It turns on and works.This is not Snap-On or Matco.About the same grade of tool that you can get from Harbor Freight.  Be gentle.  Don't drop it.  Don't pull on the cord.  Don't leave it in the bottom of a bucket, all the while throwing heavy things on top of it.  I keep it in the drawer of my work bench.  I use it.  I put it away.  Mine has yet to break.

Seems Ok. Threaded easily into bowl, no leaks..so we are happy.I would note the cap is not what is pictured (no 1/2" drive hole) but an open web. Which is fine though filters with the square hole to accept 1/2" ratchet just easier to install, especially removing. Filters with flat perimeter raised sides, like factory cap or others, you can use a strap wrench, but thats why I started using filters with cap that had hole. Course installing with 1/2" drive could lead to easily over tightening so maybe a good thing for some. Lightly coating all the gaskets, 2 included o-rings and the base gasket, with deisel, threaded on. Once snug laid 3/8" extension across web to nudged a tad past goodnsnug.For the price and convenience appears decent filter. Likely though will not repurchase due to cap design, I'd rather buy filters I have tools for than a 'special' tool.

Stay away from these unless you want problems.I had these on my vehicle and the lug key broke while changing out a flat- not once, but on 3 different subsequent occasions. Luckily for me the first one that came with my vehicle brand new broke after I put the spare tire on while tightening the wheel lug lock back on. The second and third occasion I was not so lucky. I had to go through McGard's customer service department to order replacement lug keys at approximately $15 (plus shipping if you want it expedited otherwise expect to wait 2 weeks) on 2 different occasions. In the end, both replacement lug keys from McGard broke. I couldn't believe it. Three keys breaking like this in about as many months with the last 2 being ordered back-to-back at an additional costs to me. On top of it their customer service doesnt even care that they may have a quality control issuecrazy! Short version is I decided to break the lug locks off manually, without further playing around with any of their cheap keys, delays, and wanting more money for a product they cannot even stand by.Now some may wonder about the lug locks being put on too tight, however that was not the case. I tighten all my lug nuts and lug locks by hand with a torque wrench. In this particular application, specs call for 135 ft-lbs per lug nut, however with the lug locks I go much less at 90 ft-lbs (as a precautionary measure).My conclusion is the metal they are using for these lug keys are of cheap grade, and is too malleable for its purpose (you can be judge from the pictures). My belief is they quite possibly have a quality control issue in their production machine shop and or the manufacturing of these for it to be a repetitive problem as I experienced. My advice, if you must have lug locks, I highly recommend you go with the spline type.

Nice quality light, comes with 3 mounts, used 2 and seems to be solid, nice light output. Mine does not seem to be a spot/ flood combo. Appears to be just a spot, but the beam is wide enough that it does a good job on back country roads. Made the mistake of mounting the brackets all the way on the outside. Now to adjust it i have to take the bar off. Time will tell how it holds up.

I've only tested the light with a drill battery but it seems to be very bright. I will update after I have it installed on my Jeep. I gave a 4 star rating because the instructions say that you can use side mounts but only the bottom mounts are included.Update: I installed the light on my fairlead and it's bright. Probably not as bright as a more expensive light but I'm happy with it. Only time will tell if it's really waterproof though. I kinda doubt the waterproof and dust proof rating is accurate.

This item absolutely DOES NOT FIT on an OEM track bar.  The sleeve is MUCH wider than the OEM bolt, and unless you are welding a new bracket on the axle or have found a captive nut that can accommodate a wider bolt, there is no easy solution for this problem.  I'm returning this and will be buying an OEM part.You can see in the picture that there is a significant amount of space between the sleeve and the bolt.  This would ride like absolute hell.

Excellent product for anyone that lives in a 4 season state.  Mainly including snow and rain.  With all the snow up in the northeast you know there's gonna be tons of sand and salt on the roads and not even mention the moisture from rain/snow itself.  These mats are digitally cut for your specific car. That means no sliding around of the mats or the mats getting pushed all the way up. NOPE they stay right where they're supposed to.If you've ever spilled something in your car. You know what these mats would do for you.  Save you the trouble to cleaning your carpets and keeping your car clean. With these mats they will be able to me taken right out and dumped in seconds!  You'll question how you ever lived without these liners in the first place!

This is a very bright LED light bar that I mounted on my Grizzly 700 ATV.Very bright.  Almost punishingly so when you are viewing objects at a close distance.  You really can't even see the stock headlights with this this on.Good mounting hardware.  It is nice to have stainless steel instead of cheaply painted steel.The build quality leaves a little to be desired.  The allen bolts on the side that hold the end caps on, have very little to thread into.  They are threaded into the side extrusion fins.  I'd say they have about 40% of the normal 'bite' that a bolt in a blind or through hole would have.The cast aluminum bracket (that has 4 tiny set screws) was not machined all of the way through.  It prevented me from attaching it to my atv and required me to redrill and retap 2 of the set screw locations.  The stainless brakets are good, but this is a cheesy setup even if executed well. I'm worried those set screws will just rust and or fall out.  See attached picture.VERY easy mounting to my atv rack.

Had these on my tahoe for a 6 months now, work great, look great. Gives my right a aggressive stance on these 35s. I gave them 4 stars bc there's no lip in the center for the rim to sit on so they're basically sitting on the studs. Still a great buy though. I off road on them and they hold up.

I really like this speedo. My 12' KTM 250 XC-W stock speedo got water in it and stopped working. I feel like this one is easier to use and if you make a trip to the hardware store for longer bolts and some nylon spacers, you can make it fit in the location of the stock speedo. It works and looks great.

Ordered a new cover because my last $30 one flew away over the weekend. New cover arrived promptly, in a convenient carrying bag made of the same material as the cover itself. Thicker, soft cotton inner lining, and a strap at the bottom (to prevent blowing away) makes this cover 10x better than the last for only a bit more money. Left cover on and left for a few days, so an update will be made when I return home. Happy so far, and would recommend based on the preliminary test.EDIT 4/17/17Girlfriend just bought a 1985 Kawasaki 454 LTD and needed a cover, and I didn't think twice about reordering this one. I never fear my bike getting wet when it rains, and the strap on the bottom prevents blowing as expected. I love this cover, and would recommend it to anyone who needs one.

First off, the dimensions in the description are off. The length (would be inlet to outlet on a muffler) is 17 inches and the width is 10 inches (closer to 11 inches but squeezes to about 10 when clamps are tight). The measurements given in the description are closer to the size of the box it comes packaged in.But if you have a 50 series Flowmaster, then you really don't need the dimensions.As for another reviewer complaining how it does not fit and the clamps are too short, This fits perfect. The clamps are plenty long too. Flowmaster would NOT package a shield that does not fit their mufflers. Just make sure you know what you have. The photo I added of this heat shield on the Flowmaster under my Camaro should prove that it fits and the clamps are long enough. In fact the clamps could have been a bit shorter(simple worm clamps like a hose clamp... a 23" long hose clamp).I also added some strips of Cool It Thermo Tec Aluminized heat barrier to the inside of this shield. It would have been nice if something like this was already added and no additional cost, But I don't see that as a reason to take any stars away from this product.

I was looking for an IR flood light to light up a screened in patio. I really didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars and be disappointed at the results or purchase some big hulking light that stuck out, so I ordered the IR30 illuminator.The IR 30 is described as a wide angle, LED illuminator. I found that the lighting is surprisingly uniform. The patio is roughly 20 feet by 25 feet, with a IR camera placed 15 feet away. The patio went from being completely black at night to very visible. I did not expect it to come with a power supply so I ordered a CCTV power cable splitter and used an extra CCTV power cord I had laying around. For the price, less than $10, I do not feel I went wrong. It serves it's purpose, it's small enough to almost be unnoticeable, and automatically turns on and off.

Got it to replace my positive terminal that is copper and after 10 years of corroding/tightening it was starting to break the soft copper.  I did get a fair bit of corrosion on the old terminal despite using felt pads, etc. so perhaps this non-copper terminal with the plastic under it will help with that.  Seems like a solid replacement so I'm happy with it.

Update:  I have had these on my car for 13 months now and none have fallen off.  The automatic cartwash doesn't scratch or pull these off. I couldn't be happier!Many customers who have purchased other brands of wheel covers complain that they fall off after a few miles.  These have stayed put after several hundred miles.  The key with these is to put the steel tension ring on the inside of the plastic tabs and not within or outside the tabs.The covers do not come with any instructions at all and the YouTube videos are mostly wrong for this brand of wheel cover.

I was going to give this product a 5 stars but today I found out it ripped. The poor quality stitching only lasted a month and gave up. I was really happy about the product because I driver a lot and used to hate driving because I would always feel uncomfortable after an hour. After installing the cooling car seat, i started to enjoy my drives even more because I didn't had a sweaty back. It's a great concept but the poor quality of the stictching made this product a fail.

I've used this a few times. First was on a set of faded OEM floor mats. Worked great. brought them back to life and has held up to daily use for over a year. Bought a second can to change the color of the carpeted door panel inserts on my car (I used SEM for the plastic and vinyl parts). Worked great. Will buy this again for any carpet recoloring/restoring I need to do.

I put these on my new 2016 R1200GS Adventure.  I did have to cut them down to fit lengthwise but these are almost identical to the old "grip puppies" I had on my 2006 GSA.I let them soak in HOT.. VERY HOT soapy water for a little while and then I was able to force them on over my existing grips.  Love the larger diameter now for the long rides.  I have zero ill effect noticed when riding the back roads and dirt roads.

I have a pair of these 48w square LED lights and a pair of the 27w round LED lights on my motorcycle.  FYI they draw just under 8 amps for all four lights.  Although the round lights were brighter than my stock headlight,  I'd estimate these square lights to be about 50-75% brighter than the 27w versions.  They are BRIGHT,  way brighter than my stock headlight.  I'm super happy with this purchase and how can you beat the pricing? $18.80 for two 48w square LED lights with prime shipping (that only took one day too!) A+ in my opinion.That said,  they aren't perfect, but the price makes my nitpicking moot. The mounting brackets were pretty chintzy, 1/2 as thick as the brackets that came with the round lights.  Who cares though, it's not like they don't do the job just fine....I'm just being a nitpick.

I did a side by side test of this and a product called Evapo-rust that I bought at rural king for $16/gal. I soaked equally rusty bolts and nuts in both for about 2 days and here are the results.Evapo-rust is on the left, Naval Jelly on the right. As you can see, the Naval jelly did not perform as well at penetrating the rust and lifting it. I will note that both products ask that you clean the metal before soaking...I didn't do this.One advantage that Naval Jelly does have is it's thick viscosity. It could be painted on where evaporust cannot.

These work pretty well.  I am actually using them on 1/2 stainless braided vacuum hoses.  I had to drill out the opening on the ends to get these clamps over the 1/2 fittings.  But they work great and look very good.  I was able to hide the screw clamp parts on the bottom so they don't show very much.  These seem to be well made for what they are.

I love the bumper. But it came with about an inch size dent, right out of the box. I took a lot of time and consideration on what bumper to buy and what company to buy it from. I'm the new car sales manager of a Jeep dealership, and I regret not buying this product through my dealership and paying the extra money. At least that way I would not have received a damaged part with no recourse.

Excellent fit and finish. This thing is long but fits perfectly next to the radiator. The mounting option is good but not intuitive, places the bracket at the back of the tank. Others have complained about slightly angled piping, at this price point I would say that its still a amazing value.

Bought this to test the waters of Recon products, as you can see I had to buy their tails also soon after. Love it. As others say the cargo lights are on full time except when the key is out of the ignition or off with lights off, that being said it is very dimly lit, when the cargo light is actually turned on it is many times brighter. Love the look! And NO LEAK!

Bought this as a wash/ wax alternative for a 38 ft 5th wheel RV. The degreaser works well for stubborn spots and black streaks with little effort. Did the entire coach in less than 4 hours and the finished result was as desired. A clean shiny coach and the water beads up and rolls off. Edit: Just wanted to add that the idiot that gave a one star because he let his finish get oxidized needs a wake up call. No wash or wax on the planet is going to put a shine on a neglected oxidized finish. Like anything else you have to maintain it. If you have let your finish go from pure neglect you will need to use polishing compound and remove the oxidation regardless of what product you choose to preserve the finish. Photos added after having used this product for 2 years now. RV looks like new.

These were a perfect fit for my truck. These bulbs are a little longer than the stock bulbs, but all of the locations I put these in had plenty of room to spare, except the glove box light. I love the aluminum housing and the bright light that comes from these bulbs. I put these on my Ram Truck on the 3rd brake light, the license plate light, and the glove box light. I needed 6 bulbs, so these fit exactly where I needed them to go. I was going to replace my 3rd brake light with an aftermarket light, but with these in there, there is no need for me to change it (save me some $ and I get the brightness of LED). I did encounter 2 instances where I had to turn the bulbs to match the correct polarity, but the other 4 went in correctly. If I had put in the first bulb with the wrong polarity, I might have guessed these weren't compatible with my truck, but luckily I got all 6 to work. I didn't get a chance to take pics of the 3rd brake light with the old bulbs in them, but trust me these were a vast improvement. I did take pictures of the license plate lights for comparison (yellow one is the old bulb and the really bright white light is the LED). I rarely use the glove box light, but rest assured, it too was just as bright.I received these bulbs at a discount for my honest feedback.

Think I might put some glue in the loop that holds the tubing.  Couple times now I've had the tubing come out and remaining in the awning channel with the holder in my hand.  I don't leave them sitting in the channel all the time as we have a sun screen to use in the day, so sliding them in and out creates problems with the tubing falling out - especially when it wasn't the last one to go in.Updated: 6/2015.  The more I learn about Camco, the more I consider them the K-mart of RV/Camping.  Cheap chineese products, if you roll up your awning after a rain or in the morning with dew on it, like when leaving the camground to hit the road, the eyelets will rust and of course stain your awning material.  Look for a stainless product, or always take these out if it's rolled up for a while.  Here's a picture after one night at a beachside campground when I need to roll up the awning before sleeping as if got pretty windy out. The awning had already collected dew.  You can see the ring left in the awning above the holder after I tried to wipe it off.Wonder if amazon sells CLR.....

I ordered these foot pegs bc I was tired of placing my foot on the little stub of the lower door hinge. These pegs are super sturdy and very well made. They screw on tight and do not move once tightened down. I have used them twice so far and haven't had any issues at all. The only thing I can think of is its not very comfortable for those who are shorter. My wife is 5'3 and she finds that the peg is a little far for her reach. Of course, she could just scoot the chair forward....but she prefers to stay where she's comfortable. I received this product at a discounted price in return for an unbiased review.

Saw this dude selling this lip on the forums. Based on the reviews, seemed legit and purchased on Amazon for the added protection.Install took about few hours, but that's because I'm a perfectionist. You'll definitely need a heat gun. Purchased the "PORTER-CABLE PC1500HG 1500-Watt Heat Gun" just for this lip. End results were great. No gaps! But one must be very patient.My secret was first centering the lip. Once centered, screwing in the center 4 screws. Now this is where patients comes in handy - One side at a time, begin heating the lip from the center outwards. Do about 1-2 feet at a time. Once it begins to heat up, use a clamp to hold the back of the lip and bumper together. As they cool, the lip will mold to the bumper. Don't get greedy, take your time! Once its cooled, put a screw in and move another 1-2 feet down and repeat.For $50, I'm very pleased! Peace my NA brothas!

These LED's are fairly bright, but not near a standard H11 Sylvania bulb, see the pictures.  And not only are they not as bright but these bulbs with their high speed fan are louder than my 2016 Subaru Legacy 2.5i engine at idle!  I can seriously hear these over the engine, in and out of the car with the car running.  I had these in for less than 10 minutes and as much as I want to like them, I can't.  They just don't have the sight distance, again, see pictures.  To top it off, the polarity of the plug is backward, it is reversible, but backward.  If you reverse this plug it takes very little effort and the light disconnects.  How many of these reviews were paid for to get the star rating these have?  On a side note these would be a pretty good fog light, just definitely not a main head light.  I'd say my sight distance dropped around 50 feet, that could definitely be the deciding factor in hitting someone or not.  In the pictures the car was not moved and I was standing in the same place and took the picture.  The first picture is halogen, second LED, 3rd halogen cropped to show distance detail and the 4th LED cropped to show distance detail.

Please see photos! Lots of Rear Fit photos! Purchased for 2007 Jeep Wrangler JK strictly for beach sand issues. It does not snow or rain here so I cannot attest to wet. Fits very, very well. No problems. Light smell. The soft top is down w/ just the Spider Web Shade on. I expect the smell to go away since the Jeep will be well aired. That mats fit well. Took lots of photos of the rear mats so please look! (Also please ignore the dog hair. I have a golden retriever. It's a losing battle.)

The is a very nice inexpensive bumper with a simple clean design for two D - rings. - weighs around 60 lbs.- bolted on easy and perfect fit on my 2015 JK. It is a close match to my front Rampage texture black finish bumper. The rear bumper sits right above the factory tow hitch receiver and I did not have to move the trailer wire plug receptacle.

Solid little valve.  Will definitely make changing the oil faster and cleaner.  It will also allow the oil to be changed while it is hot.  I was a little concerned about how secure the valve would be and was surprised how well it locks in place when closed.  As added security I put a lock tie on it which can simply be cut off at my next change.  The valve will also allow you to take an oil sample for testing if you want.*I added the blue cap I happened to have laying around just to keep the valve hole clean.

First off, I love cars and always have.  I am not a pro- detailer but have been scrubbing and rubbing on cars since I was a kid in the mid 1980's.  I have used all sorts of products to clean, shine and make the most out of a variety of paint finishes and conditions.  Over the years I have used some OK waxes, some really good waxes and some great waxes.  That said, this is really my new favorite and that is saying a lot as there are some great brands to be had at any auto parts store.I used it on a well buffed and polished Ford Wimbledon white paint job and it came out far better than I have ever seen a white paint come out.  I have owned this car for several years and polish often just to relieve stress... but this was is amazing on this color.  I buffed a small spot on a metallic deep orange paint as well as black and was equally impressed.  Will do those cars/trucks later this summer.  Over all a great product and I am also really happy with the overall recent batch of Chemical Guys stuff that I got and believe that I will phase out all my older products and stick with this brand.  Rain and water beads off well.One odd note:  This wax also smells really good.  I noticed that small flying bugs also noticed as there were about 10 on my car hanging out.

This item was purchased for my 2013 Impreza with Moda MD20 Rims. They fit perfectly no over hang etc. However note that the diameter clearance is a snug thin wall 19mm, so pick your lug wrench/ sockets wisely. I ordered a spare McGard Key which was too thick and could not be used. the diameter as measured are seen in the photo attachments

I will give this 5 stars as it does what it says.  I clipped the RAZO on the mirror of my 2014 Tacoma.  I went from just seeing the three back seat head rests, to seeing from my face over to the passenger window. Many blind spots are now visible. The only thing is that it is not a double angle mirror. Meaning, when you flip your standard mirror to dim headlights, it does not work like a flip mirror where the headlights are dimmed. That said, I found that lights do not appear as bright in this mirror like my standard.  The truth is, the electric mirror market is still evolving. You won't find an electric with wide angle capabilities.  This worked great, AND the don't affect the sun visor from coming down.

The opening in the Anco blade is smaller than the original therefore it will not fit and snap into place on the wiper arm there's not enough room for that as you can see in the photo that I posted. original blade shown on top... Amco blade shown on the bottom of picture you can tell they are not the same. The opening on the left is not large enough. Im sure the blade itself would work just fine if it fit but it dont.

Bought these to put on my golf cart at camp. Have yet to install them but they are similar to the ones I had on it before. Last pair stopped working after about 7 years. Nice thing about these is they have a remote control. Last set I had I had to keep pushing a button repeatedly to get the setting I wanted. Uploaded some photos. Will add some better ones next time I am at camp

Installed these on my 98 XJ Dana 30 HP front differential. I do have ABS, and a previous review had stated that these would not work if you have ABS because they will rub. I am not sure of his setup but mine fit perfectly with no rubbing or interference issues whatsoever. Good product. Only downside I see is that if your inner axle seals are leaking, these will prevent you from seeing that and the only way to tell is to pull your axles. A good idea to replace the inner seals while you install these to give you peace of mind if you know they have a lot of miles on them. Inner seals are only a couple dollars so it's a cheap insurance. Best thing to do is point the grease zerk towards the rear of the vehicle, this way if you are plowing through mud it doesn't directly force any dirt into the fitting in which you want to grease each time before you go wheeling. This keeps the seal

Basic cooling system pressure tester for the old style radiators & caps.  It includes 12270 tester, one radiator cap adapter, one 12559 rubber spacer washer for deep necks, an instruction manual, and a plastic blomold case.  Barrel wasn't tight so first couple of tries wouldn't test properly, but after tightening it works well.  Gauge has a plastic face with easy to read numbers & color coded pressure areas.  The hose says made in USA and is a Thermoid brand.  I cannot distinguish where the unit was assembled.

Put these on my 2016 Silverado Crew Cab High Country.  Mud flaps were put on with the wheels off on purchase day.  Cut excess with a Drexel tool.  Cuts hot so don't melt the rubber.  Watch the angle especially toward the wheel well.  The mud flaps I show on here are just a sample not the ones on the truck.  Used screws, but you might have to use a bit 1/64" larger on one or two holes.I am very satisfied with the look.  Thanks Putco.

I bought this mirror to replace the side mirror on my '66 International 1000a pickup. The arm and pivot ball were still on the truck, but the mirror portion was missing. I wasn't sure if this would fit or not, but it did, perfectly.You have to remove the mirror glass to be able to take it apart, do so by GENTLY inserting a small flat screwdriver or similar tool around the outside edge of the rubber. Push it gently until you 'feel' it go past the edge of the glass, then pry the mirror out. It's not glued in or otherwise secured, so with a gentle pull it'll 'pop' out.Once it's off, you can remove the arm by removing the three screws on the back of the mirror, the same ones you'd use to adjust the angle. Then you have to remove a screw on the mounting bracket, and pull the whole assembly through the mirror.For my application, it was a simple matter of replacing the pivot ball with the one that was on my truck, it was almost the same size. Depending on how you're using it, you might need to modify the pivot ball, or use the one that the mirror came with (it's permanently attached to the arm, so you'll probably have to cut it). But it's a cheap, and decent quality, replacement.Oh- And IF you plan to just use it as intended right out of the package, it looks like a pretty well made part, fairly solid and well built. Seems to be a good deal compared to some of the other ones that you see out there.

Finally! Fits perfectly on my 2016 Harley Davidson Softail Heritage Classic.  Height can be adjusted. However, even at its lowest setting, it reaches just below my mid back. It'd be great if could reach my lower back.I also adjusted the handlebars towards me, making all a more comfortable ride.I haven't gone on long rides yet, just in city streets. But so far, so good.Well worth it.

Hey all this seat recline block set is very well made from auxmart  factory seat angle  is 16 degrees  and after the install it's at 27 degrees  it doesnt mess with the folding down of the seat. The hardest part of the whole install was taking out the factory bolts  I used the red rope in the photos  to hold the lower seat up to get to the back bolts

First of all I am glad to be an Amazon Prime Member.  I looked around for this alternator locally and it was priced a lot more.  I paid to have the Bosch Alternator delivered next day because I have been having difficulty starting my 2005 Chevrolet Tahoe each morning.  Due to the age of the alternator I opted to purchase a brand new part instead of trying to rebuild it.  The item arrived on the date that Amazon said it was going to be delivered on.  I came home and found that that the Bosch AL8782N was an exact match to my original stock alternator that came with my 2005 Chevrolet Tahoe.  The only thing which I had to reuse was the nut from the back of my old alternator which held the wire covered by the rubber boot cover that is on the back of the both alternators.  It is a 10mm nut and it screwed on the back of the Bosch AL8782N without any problems.  It did not take very long to remove the old alternator and install the Bosch AL8782N.  My car is running fine without any problems thanks to my new part.

3 stars because it works... but it needs some modifications. So Im using this on a 2000 Ram 3500 Cummins 47re. On my 2000 and I suspect 98.5-02, the fitting on the heat exchanger has a check valve in it vs the 94-98 it was in the line like this one is. So to use it on a newer truck you need to remove one of the check valves, or both. I removed mine all together long ago when I built my trans, theses valves can clog and toast the trans. They are also restrictive and don't help cooling in that regard. The only downside is the tc will drain when its not running so you will notice it takes a few seconds when you start the truck for it to move as you wait for it to refill. My trans flows in park now, but stock you need to put it in drive or neutral to get it to fill.So, I just removed the entire rubber end price and put a bar fitting on it to hook up to my existing hose and barb setup.Also as you can see in my pics the temp port has a tiny off centered hole drilled in it, so I drilled it out to full size. Poor quality here imo. Make sure to clean it out good if you do this.I installed this line because I had been running straight hose for some time and I didn't like the way the hose dangled under the trans, it was starting to wear in some spots. This oem like steel line gave me something solid to zip tie the other hose/line too. I kept the hose setup after this because I run custom coolers and the other steel lines didn't line up with. I also had a big bulky brass tee fitting for the temp sensor, this was much cleaner for the sensor mount.Overall with the mods, the line worked out well. Well worth it over the cost of the dealer line imo. At least with Amazons price on it.Edit: after my install I was messing around with the unused end peice (rubber hose with fittings), I was able to just pull the check valve fitting off the rubber hose that it came with with my bare hands, probably because the barbs are smooth not sharp like a normal fitting. I would highly highly recommend NOT useing the rubber hose bits on this product buy it for the steel line thats it!. Also OMG look at the size of the check valve fitting!!!! Thats a trans killer!

Used these to get the clamps off the heater control valve of a 2005 F350.  The valve is located towards the rear of the engine compartment.  Being able to put these clamps on, ratchet it down till the clamps loosened and the slide the clamp off made the job easy.  I could have seen me spending another hour+ fussing with those clamps.  I really like that these ratchet tight and then hold until released.  Perfect.

I did not have high hopes for $24 lights. But I wanted a cheap set for the back of my jeep because I tend to bump trees and didn't want to waste an expensive set.  I set these up using a harness designed to turn on with my reverse lights, and also have an override to turn them in whenever.I am more then happy, they are nearly as bright as my headlights! Quality seemed good, access to tighten the mounting bolts isn't that great if you're in a tight spot but manageable.  I do wish there were left and right lights, having the cables both come out the same side messes with my OCD a bit.I may buy these for the front too since they are 15% the cost of the competition.

I was skeptical based on the price, but with as many positive reviews I figured I didn't have much to lose.  This set is fantastic.  The install was very easy.  I painted the shrouds and the internal parts of my lamps to match.  Easy to fit and adjust.  This kit looked to me like another name brand projector kit available online.  This kit includes the shrouds - not that I really cared, but without them it would look odd.Fantastic kit, easy to install, perfect price.  WIN.  Get this if you are doing your first retrofit, then buy it again for the next job - I know I will.

I consider this a must-own for any cyclist who rides on the road. It works exactly as advertised and is literally like having a digital partner to yell "Car back!" to you when you're out on the road. I was extremely (pleasantly) surprised at how far away it detects cars coming up behind me, and the fact that it can show multiple cars is a bonus. It's especially good when you're pedaling into a headwind - when your ears are getting blasted with wind noise. The GPS chirp is still quite audible and more than once it's detected a car coming up on me when my "cycling spidey sense" didn't.I paid $149 for this via Prime and I think it's the best cycling purchase I've ever made. I do 4-5000 miles a year, and think that this could be a life saver. It only has to work once to more than pay for itself. Absolutely 5 stars all the way - I've had some issues with Garmin devices in the past but this thing does exactly what's advertised.

I bought a used Explorer 4.6L with over 200,000 miles and figured it would be a good idea to at least change out the plugs.  Boy am I glad I did!  The ones that were in there were in horrible shape!  These new ones are what should have been in there from the factory and I set all of the plugs to a 0.54 gap and voila!  I added a pic of the old plugs to show why you should consider replacing your plugs every 100,000 miles!  Best of luck!!

I got this knowing that the hi-lift would probably block some of the windshield spray which it does, but after having my tire carrier crack I figured a little less weight on it wouldn't hurt. I installed it with the base on the passenger side and the handle towards the front which allowed the most spray to hit the windshield. It didn't take long to install as the hood mounts come with very detailed instructions with color pictures. You do need a t50 torx, a couple hex / Allen wrenches and an adjustable wrench or 5/8 open end wrench. I went to install it but couldn't find my t50 torx bit that I thought I had, so I went and got one and after getting the hi-lift installed I found it right where I put it so I wouldn't forget where I put it. Overall I am happy with it. It could have had a little more thought put into the design so that it wouldn't block any of the spray but it does what it's supposed to do plus makes the jeep look way tougher.UPDATE: While driving, the wind seems to push the washer spray down just enough to mostly miss the hi-lift. Very little actually hit the hi-lift while traveling at 55mph.

Disappointing performance. Lowsided in mud at 10mph ONE time and the shifter literally bent completely backwards over top of the footpeg. Check the picture for evidence; the blue circle is my footpeg, the red circle is where the shifter ended up.I was able to bend it *somewhat* back into position, long enough to finish the ride home anyways but I'll have to replace it for sure.Disappointingly fragile, the bending tip didn't seem to help at all. I'd give it less than 3 stars but at least I was able to bend it back and get home, rather than it simply snapping off plus it wasn't particularly expensive. So I'm trying to be generous here.

My last several cars have had some sort of visors installed, usually another brand. That brand doesn't currently make one to fit my Subaru Crosstrek, so I had to find another company that made them. After researching several options,  (there's really only three) I decided on the WellVisors. Amazon was out of them, so we ordered from the manufacturer's website.The set came nicely packaged, with each visor in its own foam sleeve. The visors match the black colors on the door frames almost exactly. I was expecting them to have "Crosstrek" stamped on them, per other reviews, but they say "WellVisors" instead, which is fine. Impreza owners will be pleased ;)Installation was simple, and took me about an hour, with me REALLY taking my time. I didn't want to mess it up, so I read the instructions thoroughly several times, and found a nice video on their website (direct link to YouTube [...]) There are some extra mounting hardware pieces included. I did need to use one of the extra pins because I didn't hold the "nut" portion close enough to the bracket for it to grab properly. Make sure you get the nut part tightly up against the back side before you push the locking pin through the sleeve. That was the hardest part, as my fingers aren't that strong. The brackets were easy to slide into place between the door frame and weatherstripping. There is also adhesive tape to hold the visors on - 3M, I think.I do not notice any increase in wind noise with these installed. I love that I can open the windows when it's raining without water getting in. I can even use my windshield washer without getting drenched on the drivers side. With the windows open, I can have them further down with a noticeable reduction in that annoying gale force winds coming in. My dog really appreciates that part :) My son says the car looks "sporty and outdoorsy" with these on.

I would not mount this part and trust my life to this with 700-800 lbs going down the highway and this spinning at 1200 RPM.1. Dent in one side plate of the pulley which pushes the lip inward about 102. Inner side plate has 2 angles, not one flat plane, resulting in a sharp gap in the corner of where the belt goes. I'm not sure if this is by design, but it's 10-12 only one side of the belt. The other side is perpendicular.3. Sharp spike on inner plate from the stamping process. Sloppy work.4. Metal shavings in the box.  Come on.  Have a little pride or send it through a parts washer.5. Light visible through a gap between the side plate and center pulley section.  Again, sloppy machining work.6. All things considered, it seems that one side plate is warped and I think the belt rides on the inner side on this bike, IIRC, which means that the belt would be rubbing against a warped surface with every revolution.  I'd imagine this would prematurely wear the belt and maybe the pulley too, and it would probably make some awful shrieking or squeaking noises.I will be exchanging my pulley for another and will leave a full review once a good pulley arrives.

Made my car have a deep-rich shine. Almost made the paint look like moving water it was so nice. It went on very nicely, like butter. Came off very easily with a microfiber towel. I used it on my WRB WRX and it still looks fantastic 1 month later. I only used about 1/10 of this to cover my entire car. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a deep shine, I can only imagine it makes black cars look absolutely amazing.UPDATE: I have recently used this on my father's black Fusion. The results speak for themselves. This paint had not been properly detailed in over 2 years. It now has glossy, wet, black paint. I highly recommend this to anyone with black paint.

I got this bag for my Sport Touring bike so I could do some day trips without having to wear a backpack. Overall the bag is great. It holds everything I need for a day trip (raincoat, drinks, snacks, map, cellphone, and mp3 player). There are plenty of pockets to keep things organized. My only complaint is that the map pocket is so-so. The spot where you put the map in, is smaller than what a normal map folds down to. So in order to get the map in it, you have to either refold it and make more creases, or just try to stuff it in. Neither option works great, but so far that is the only thing I have found that was sub-great.UPDATE 8. Oct. 2013I have now switched to a more dual-sport style bike (2013 KLR650) and I continue to use this tank bag. This bag has held up great in the high altitude Colorado sun. There is no UV fading, the map pocket is still crystal clear, every zipper still works, rain-fly is still waterproof...the list goes on and on. Aside from just common wear over the years, this bag is like new. I would buy this bag again if I had to do it all over again. I love it.

They're brightER than my stock incandescent bulbs, but they're not overpoweringly bright or stupidly bright. For some reason they have a very slightly purpleish-blue hue to them. It's not what I'd call "cool white" but it's really not noticeable unless you're looking directly at them and trying to nitpick. Makes my car 2x nicer feeling inside.

This is a great dressing. I like the fact that you can dilute it and make it work for what you want it to do. I have used this at 2:1 for tires and the fender wells too. Being that I use this as a spray it makes it really easy to apply on the tires and fender wells on the car. I just spray a few light mists on the entire tire and then I use a microfiber brick pad to rub it into the tire. The dressing goes on very easily and does not streak or smear. Due to the spray application and being a little thinner this gets into all the nooks in the tires easily. This is way easier than using one of those thick tire gels and foam applicators to apply with. At this dilution it does give the tires a very dark look with a bit of shine. I have not had any issue with it being sticky or slinging off the tires. The shine does actually last for quite awhile even after it rains or through a wash.  I also really like that it is a water based dressing. It doesn't seem to "attract" dirt or dust.

The reason why I bought this Hood Protector is because of it's low profile. I didn't want to add anymore chrome because I didn't want my 2013 Silverado to look tacky. The pictures that was provided by you fellow truck owers is what made me get this Hood Protector. So I decided to add a pic as well. Thanks!

I was looking at this for a while.  I finally purchased it after looking at the other options out there.  I just received it and installed it so I can't give a lengthy write up how it will stand up over time, but this appears to be a sturdy piece of equipment that will do the job.  My advice is watch the installation videos a couple times.  Have a short Phillips head ready to secure the bottom screws.  Use the the tip in one of the videos to drop the back part of the unit to line up the screws in the rear flange.  If possible have someone around to help hold things while you are trying to screw things in.  Installation was easy, but the bigger you are the more difficult it is because of the space and the small screws.  Another helpful tip was to remove the rubber mat on the bottom of the console before installation.  That makes it fit better and you just place it over the cross members when you are done.  I included some pictures of the box, the unit before installation, the installed unit with the rubber mat back in place and the unit closed with the junk tray in place.  The tray will have to stay on the driver's side of the lock due to spacing.  I like this console safe but we will see how it holds up over time.

Looks great and simple to install. Fit my 2015 Nissan Frontier SV Crew Cab. You will remove 4 plastic rivets holding the rubber seal to the hood. Then slide this in between the hood and seal. Use the provided washers and screws in place of the plastic rivets to secure it. Takes about 15 minutes. I can't really speak to how well it keeps bugs off windshields. I just installed it and the bugs are dying off this time of year anyway. Really bought this more for looks than anything else and it does look sharp. A nice contrast to the silver color of my truck.  Followed the lead of another post'er and placed the stick-on bumpers on the back side of the deflector as opposed to on the truck itself. Makes more sense that way. One end of the deflector is definitely closer to the body than the other. I loosened up the bolts and tried to readjust but no dice. Not a big deal; can't even tell when looking front on. A nice, inexpensive addition to your vehicle and everyone raves about AVS being the best. I'm happy with it.

I use these gloves everyday, I like them because they are cheap and they are comfortable, I love the knuckles protections and the palm plastic part. However this is my 3rd pair, their are cheap but they are not so good quality. For me it starts to break around the Velcro area every time. But Im happy with them, so when they break I just spend another $10 and purchase new ones.

fits perfect and looks great as promises.  It does have a strong odor as indicated by a few reviews I saw.  It has the new car smell from the rubber and I am assuming the protective sealant that may be on it.  But I did not find it offensive and like all things new, it will disappear in time.  installation went as predicted.  It is best to put these things on when the temperature is above 80 and also leave the new cover in the vehicle for about an hour prior to installation.  It slips right on.  Today the weather was about 65 yo 70.  Putting it on took about 5 minutes and patients.About the only thing I can see that could be criticized was the packaging.  The box was entirely too big for the product and a basic waste of space for the driver delivering the package.  It was in a huge box 25 times larger than the item and had a scrap of paper put in like it was gonna protect it.  It would have been simpler and more efficient to place it in a sleeve type box and ship.  I am attaching a photo of the package to show.  Also who ever put it in the box looked like a 12 year did it.  Poor taping job.  The over sized, mostly empty box looked damaged and would appear that what every may be in the box would be trashed had it not just been a steering wheel cover.  I am giving a 5 star rating.  I got what I asked for.  I received it quickly and Fed Ex did an outstanding job.  Whoever packs your items though, lacks skill.

Looks great- the powder coating seems like it will hold up. I've uploaded a picture since no one has an installed one yet. I absolutely love the bumper but had to use oem brackets because mine were welded a little off leaving the bumper crooked. I deducted one star due to this issue.

I bought this for my Ford F150, and though the least expensive of all Tri-fold Tonneau covers, I can't imagine that anything else would have justified paying a higher price.  Went on very easy with the clamps all pre-attached.  Lay it out, line it up, slightly tighten the front clamps.  Unfold it, verify alignment, fold back up to finalize tightening of front clamps, the unfold it and tighten the back clamps.  That's it!  Looks great.  I'll update if it has any issues.  One slight engineering mishap.  My pickup has a plastic protective edge along the top.  I don't know if it comes that way from Ford or is after market.  But the lip of it drops about 3/16" inch below the lip of the metal. Just enough that the channel of the clamp isn't deep enough to miss it.  In order to have the clamp grab the metal lip and not bulge the plastic lip, I had to do a little trimming.  See picture.  But a minor adjustment.

I'm a bit mixed here. The bar itself, for the money, is spectacular. It's not a Rigid bar, but if you're expecting that for $40-ish, you need to change your expectations.The main issue I have with my purchase, is that I purchased this bar specifically because the title states it was curved. It is, in fact, totally flat. Not even a slight curve. I had hoped to mount this bar underneath the curved fairing on my roof basket. As it turns out, it was still a good fit, and I figured I'd give it a go anyway.My setup: I have this bar mounted between the two main support bars of a Thule MOAB roof basket on my 2005 Forester XT. The factory lighting began showing it's age when I bought a 2015 BRZ and the HID's were phenomenal. I knew my Forester XT needed some help. This is intended to be a winter setup, but I'm thinking it will stick around year round as long as the bar holds up. I have this wired into my high beams, with a cutoff switch, and it's very effective. I am using a relay, but when connected directly to the battery for testing I didn't notice a substantial difference in brightness. I expect that to be different with overall performance, however.Brightness/color: This is a very bright, clear bar. The color is about where the packaging estimates, 6000k. The outer flood lights do a good job lighting up the side of the road.I mounted these using two mounts intended for small LED spot lights, and with a bit of creativity. The included factory mounts look quite nice if they are what you're after!

Second Power Stop kit I've purchased and installed. Looks great and stops great. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was because the hardware kit they sent me was different that what my 2004 4Runner actually used. See pics for differences.1st. - My Runner used little clips on each slide pin, and the kit can with the long piece of wire that hooks into both pins.2nd. - The spring that keeps tension on the pads, pushing them out, were to long and wouldn't fit into the holes on the pads.Luckily my old hardware was good enough to use again.

This is an excellent product.I'm saying this because it managed to clean up heavy grease, dirt and other stains that the white wall tires of my T-bucket raked up over the last 8 years in my garage. It even managed to clean up an extremely heavy grease stain when one of the rear tires caught the corners of the ramp of a flat bed truck.One technique that helped me immensely was that I used a spray bottle with water to clean up after application.I first sprayed this cleaner on the white walls, let it bite for a minute. I followed this by scrubbing down the tires with a scotch bright pad to remove the stains. Grease stains will need a couple more applications and light scrubbing before they can be removed. Finally, I sprayed water on it and with the help of clean shop towels, wiped up the runs. I repeated the process for a couple of times until the tires were clean and did not feel "soapy" to my fingers. This meant no large messy runs and excessive use of water.Here are some before and after pictures .

I have used a lot of chemical guys products over the last year and love them! This product was awesome! Before winter hit in MN i moved it from garage to basement with all my other car care products so they would freeze. After a month of sitting in my basement that NEVER reaches below 65 degrees i came down to find this jug completely empty! It was sitting upright and somehow ALL of the product had leaked out! I had this same issue with a few other the other gallons that came of CG products in shipping that i ordered at the same time that were replaced for the same reason. I don't see the point of buying gallon jugs if they cant be stored for a month or two. Loved the product, but cant believe every drop leaked out since last time i used it a month ago!

High quality and looks awesome. It's not large enough for my full face XL Shoei helmet otherwise would of been 5 stars but tons of space for other storage.  Great lock and can add to small locks to quick release straps if needed for extra security.  I used 1/2" rubber cushioned pipe clamps to my luggage rack  with large fender washers with 1/4 size 1" length bolts.  Clean and classic looks.  Also added 3 ' of leather fringe around front and sides with Barge cement and looks old school cool.  Overall best looking and priced bag out there. I also added a different concho instead of the Viking concho.  I just bought a three-quarter size concho with a buffalo nickel design.  Also  had to go to the hardware store to buy a longer screw and washers for the concho to fit on the bag since the Conho comes with a short screw.

This looks exactly like the original oem part but the plastic used might be slightly weaker than oem because as others have said it bounces around a bit due to the bracket, thus, only 4 stars. However, it's very easy to swap the mounting bracket from the oem part and now it's as solid as ever. In the picture is both new and old parts, swapping brackets.Great price and works just fine so far.

One would think that the design of a motorcycle license plate frame would be identical to an automobile license frame at a reduced size. If the bottom of the frame is thicker than the top, the lower bolt holes of the license plate are covered by the thicker lower portion of the frame. two tabs on the bottom rear of the thicker lower portion eliminate the need for the lower screws. As soon as I opened it, i could tell It was manufactured very well so i tossed the packaging in the trash never thinking there would be any reason to return it oh well, i guess i'm out ten bucks

I love these lights. The 50 inch curved light shines way brighter than expected. The only thing i dislike is the fact you have to use the relay in the wiring harness or else it flickers. I used the pod lights as reverse lights. It was a great idea concidering i do a lot of things off-road and the extra light really helps me to see.

My unit came in non-functioning, its a simple circuit so I figured how hard could it be to repair.  After opening up the light I found a bad solder on the switch, just touched it up with more solder and the unit was good as new.I still gave them full stars because it came with a little plastic carrying case to keep everything organised, a welcome surprise.The dye was easy to apply and showed up bright.  Plenty of length on the cord to move about.  No batteries to fuss with is the best.

Absolutely love these, which is why I ordered a total of 12. They are a must-have if you have a Polaris ATV/UTV product. We use them on my Sportsman570, my sons ACE150 and my wifes RZR900. They fit perfectly and are installed in seconds. Strong enough to hold down gas cans, coolers and our tool/gear storage over all the terrain we ride on. Makes bungy-ing down cargo a breeze.

Good lights, very bright, switchback works perfectly. Only complaint is the base is very loose in the socket. I had to use electrical tape and go around the bulb and socket a few times to make sure it won't pop out over time. These bulbs came with resistors but it was hard enough to install these on my car (2013 Chevy Volt) so I just went without. They will blink normally 3 times then start the hyperblink but that's my car's fault and not the bulb. As long as I have some music on I don't really notice the fast blinker noise so its not really a problem.

I bought this for my 2013 Nissan Leaf I just got. It's just fine--all you need.The Nissan dealerships try to push their $1,000 option, and then a $1,000 base install price. Ha! I bought this and had it installed for less than $900. I would certainly recommend having an electrician install given the voltage you are dealing with, but if you know what you are doing, you might be able to handle it, at your own risk.I have it installed outside. It seems to be fine outside. Rain is no problem.In terms of length, you pretty much need to pull in front-wise--no backing in. It might reach, but it'd be a stretch. Go for the longer cord if that's what you need. Personally, I'm fine with it, and I don't need to unwind it at all to plug it in. Very convenient.Some chargers have all sorts of options, controls, etc. You don't need all that. The car has the smarts necessary (at least on the Leaf).In terms of charging, it seems to go from about 20% to 100% in 4-4.5 hours I think. Not 100% sure on that as I use the charging timer. I need to setup the alerts, but it's plenty fast to be sure.I'd definitely recommend it over most of the other options I looked at.

Great solid rack, I use it to carry small race bikes (Honda NSR50's and Honda CRF's).  Built extremely well, heavy duty, and has a nice 2 or 3" rise to provide extra ground clearance.  I added reflective strips to mine.  I opted for this solid one vs. the foldable one since it's stronger and the swivel mechanism could be a weak point with extensive use.Options upgrades sold by Amazon:-"Hitch Tightener": Prevents the rack from wobbling left to right.  Keeps it tight to the hitch, good peace of mind.-ROLA 20174 Red Cargo Carrier Light Kit:  Adds brake/turn signal/running lights to the rear, extra safety in case you don't put reflective tape.  There is also an LED version which costs double, but lasts longer.-Hitch locking pin:  Hitch pin with key lock so no one steals your rack.PS: If you have a 1999 - 2004 Honda Odyssey, you'll want to upgrade your rear shocks from OEM to either heavy duty OEM shocks (e.g. Monroe with springs) or air bags.  Else you will be sagging pretty noticeably.

This was my first effort in vinyl wrapping and I wanted to do my car's center console trim. It took two tries to get the ashtray cover to where I was happy with it and the rest was on one attempt. The material is stiff but with a heat gun becomes far more malleable than I expected. I'm very happy with the way my project turned out. I used a razor, scissors, 3M adhesion promoter wipes for the edges, and a heat gun.

Great wheel chocks to use with the Race Ramp ramps.  Expensive.  I did use a carriage bolt and rope to keep them together.  They don't slide, are sturdy and keep my vehicle in place.  I like the smaller size so they clear the rear mud flaps when the front of the car is elevated.

Just super long lasting suds, has a great smell, need to use very little product. I added two cap lids to about two gallons of water in a bucket and it kept up the bubbles well past the others that I've bought at any brick and mortar place. This is great for not taking off any protective finish on your car. If you or someone that washes their own vehicle, this is a must have product.

I've been a Meguiar's user for over 10 years, and this is a great starter kit for anyone that is interested in taking the time to detail their own car versus taking it to a car wash or giving to someone as a gift.  Some people can't find the time or would rather take their vehicle through a car wash than spend a couple hours washing, waxing and detailing their car.  Maybe it's just me, but I find the experience a bit therapeutic.So here's what you get: 16-ounce Gold Class wash shampoo and conditioner, 16-ounce Quik detailer, 16-ounce Quik interior detailer, 16-ounce cleaner wax liquid , 24-ounce Hot Rims all wheel cleaner, washing sponge, foam applicator, and Supreme Shine microfiber towel.1.) 16-ounce Gold Class wash shampoo and conditioner: Just add a few capfuls to a bucket and it provides a sudsy and silky cleaner for your car that won't remove the wax that is on your car.2.) 16-ounce Quik detailer: Great to use between washes with the microfiber cloth  to clean of any bugs or grime on the paint.3.) 16-ounce Quik interior detailer: Use on the interior plastics and vinyl of your car.  Use a different microfiber cloth than the one you use for the exterior.  Recommend you apply to cloth first to avoid overspray.  Brings out the color of your interior without the greasy look. (see picture)4.) 16-ounce cleaner wax liquid:  This is Meguiar's entry level wax, but it works well at providing a layer of protection for your paint.  Water beeds up and makes it easier the next time you wash.5.) 24-ounce Hot Rims all wheel cleaner: This product works amazing at cleaning the grease and brake dust from your rims.  Just be sure to read the instructions on how to apply and rinse thoroughly. When used correctly, your rims will look brand new again.6.) Washing sponge:  It's a good sponge; mines lasted over 3 years.7.) Foam applicator: Use to apply the Cleaner Wax8.) Supreme Shine microfiber towel: This 16"x24" towel is best used to remove the wax you've applied to the car or for use with the Quick detailer.  It's very soft and should not leave any swirls or marring of your clear coat paint. Again, don't use the same microfiber towel for the interior detailer as you do for the wax removal.The only item missing from this kit is probably one of Meguiar's tire dressing products. They have other kits that include the tire dressing, but it should probably been included in this one, too.I hope you found this review helpful in making your purchase decision.

So these are one of the best things you can do for yourself if you live anywhere it will randomly rain throughout the day, like florida. They're priceless if your like me and own a black car with black leather interior, and live in a hot climate. Its  extremely important to crack my windows in the middle of summer and these things keep any random rain showers from ruining my interior. They also look really good!! Even tho i have frame less windows, thanks to the instructions install was super easy and only took like 15 min.Most of these will install on the door frame so alignment isn't an issue. On the legacy alignment is important due to the mounting above the window, the window opens with the door, so if your not careful you can mount these too low and the window will hit them. BUT follow the instructions and mount to the car and not the trim and youll be just fine!!

Got it in, shipping was okay since it was bundled up by Amazon with other stuff I oredered. Put it on, looks great but you may need to have your car raised for a cleaner and better looking application. The item itself does not have a guide so doing the bottom portions of the wheel was quite difficult, even while sitting or lying down on cardboard. Other than application, the product itself was great.

Fit perfectly. Liked that it has two size extensions to choose from. In my case I went with the shorter one. No instructions but it's a pretty straight forward installation. Word of advise: apply some anti-seize to the threads. They like to rust fuse after a couple of years. Snapped another brand off trying to remove it.

If they're too full to fit inside the net, tuck 'em between the net and the lip of the cargo bay.  Now you can pull away from green lights at a quick but sensible speed and glide through turns without scattering the groceries all over the cargo bay.When you don't need it, unhook it, neatly roll it up and stow it under the floorboard in the spare tire well.

*I received this product free in exchange for my unbiased review. This did not however have any influence on my review of this product. the following is my honest opinion.I am really in love with this motorcycle jacket. I do not ride, but I have always been a fan of this style of jacket. I love leather and the short "bad girl" look that leather motorcycle jackets have. It is really well made. The stitching is well done and the zippers are sturdy. The collar has silver buttons that hold the collar down and in place. It is also quite warm with a nice quilted lining. The jacket is a little bulky in the shoulders and it is short. This is intentional in order to make the jacket perfect for a motorcycle ride.The fit is perfect. It is tighter, but very flattering. It is a short jacket that lays at the perfect spot of my lower back. As I stated above, the shoulders are a little bulky. However, that is how it is designed. The arms are the perfect length. This jacket would really help to protect your skin if there were an accident while on a bike. The leather is genuine and feels amazing.Overall, I am super impressed with the quality of this jacket for the price. I love it and I can't wait for cooler weather so that I can wear it. I highly recommend this leather jacket.

Awesome oil for a great price. I use this in a desert racing atv. The oil recieves high speed, high revs, hot weather and overall abuse with intervals around three hundred miles per weekend ride. Before I made the switch to this oil the KTM RFS in my polaris outlaw was plagued with clutch squak. The high end oils all squaked annoyingly. Once I made the change years ago to Castrol R4 Superbike and now RS 10 50 it has improved 90%. Shifting is smoother and the fan engages less. Oil consumption dropped significantly and is now almost zero. I have no idea how many miles are total on this unit after almost 10 years of hard but maintained miles by me but it is still strong, sounds tight and still suprises me and others.Thanks Castrol for great oil.

You can see by the picture that it looks factory installed. Well it does to me anyway. But does it keep time?I have seen different reviews, some that it just didn't work. I did not get that one. I got one that will not stop working. The installation was pretty straight forward. You might think it is too small to fit, but if it looks really close, it fits. I am a little concerned about when I eventually have to take it off.I set the time with my phone on day one. It has not varied yet. I had the clock for two weeks when I noticed one day that the crystal was gone. I have no idea when it left; I was riding a lot.I was concerned because it was perfect, and I thought it would be ruined now because it was exposed to the elements. and then I forgot that there was no crystal the next time I washed my bike. I thought I trashed it. I dabbed it gently with a soft towel, and the next day the time still matched my phone. I have been rained on, and I had forgotten again when I washed my bike, and didn't use a soft towel anymore; and it is still on time 2 months later.I bought this so that I would know what time it is. You can lose track when you are riding. I ordered another one in case this one ever quits. I will make sure that the crystal is secure this time.

Great tool for keeping the camper rock solid still. Definitely need to take care to not crank them too tight. Also, these do not negate the need to traditional chocks. These are only to be installed once the trailer has been parked, disconnected, and leveled (so you'll need the traditional chocks during that process). Only after all that do you install these. The difference is noticeable, would highly suggest these to anyone with a camper trailer.

Purchased from Amazon Warehouse "Used- Like New," and it definitely was like new.  Fit like a glove under the seat of my 2016 GMC Sierra All Terrain Double Cab.  I did have to bend the tool holder a little to get the wing nut to tighten to my liking without too much issue (this workaround wouldn't be necessary with a simple update in design eliminating the lip along the back for about the length of the tire tools in-bag), however, those tools don't HAVE to be fastened down with that.  Now that I have this handy box to just drop them in, I can use that nut for nothing more than anchoring the DU-HA.It's worth noting that this product is made in America, which I LOVE!  I'm extremely pleased with the product, including the color, the fit and the quality.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone with the 14-17 model year GMC/Chevy Double Cab.

I didn't think about how high and bulky the connector would appear to sit on the windshield of my wife's 2013 Mercedes C350. I can echo what a few others have said that is just doesn't look as sleek as it should. So I have now ordered a set of Aerotwins instead and will keep this as a backup in case one of the others tear.

The picture of this product is very deceiving and should be changed.  I've own multiple similar, plastic, products in the past and all have broken over time. The whole point of purchasing this product was that the picture made it appear high quality and metal; this is not the case!  The handle looks nothing like the picture and is cheap plastic.  I expect it will last about the same amount of time as the cheaper products (it will probably break at the movable neck).  The bottom of the foam was also damaged, although I doubt it would cause any scratching or damage during use.

Update: 1/10/2017I have had this for about a year now and decided it's time to update my review. Simply put, this is junk. Do not buy it. There are three problems that I have found since my original review. First, it cracked! I don't recall ever dropping my keys. 99.9% of the time they are either in my pocket, in my truck or on my nightstand. I'm not sure how this happened. Second, I would say that about 75% of the paint has worn off the front of it. Lastly, the panic button gets pressed inadvertently ALL the time! This is VERY annoying and the straw that broke the camel's back for me!Original review: Feb. 2016I purchased this about a month ago (Jan 2016) to replace the keyless remote case when I purchased a new truck, 2004 Chevy Silverado 2500. It's okay. The guts from the old factory unit fit well inside this and the buttons looked good. The first thing I noticed was that I couldn't get it to snap together completely. There is always one section by the indent to pry it open that doesn't snap together. That wasn't a big deal to me. The second issue is that the color is not accurate. The unit I received has a green tint to it, not grey. The last, and biggest, issue is that the buttons are already worn and I've only had it a month! I don't think this will last long before you won't be able to tell what the buttons do. Although, it's just the paint on the buttons that has worn, the buttons themselves are still great.Pros:Old guts fit well inside this new shellCons:Color is green instead of greyBoth sides don't snap together tightlyButtons are already worn (but not worn out)All in all I would not recommend this.

I've always one to not believe something in a "can" works especially when it comes to automotive products.No any longer do I think that way, I put the amount according to direction, yes I read them... filled up and took a vacation trip to Northern Michigan.  I gained at least 1/2 to 1 mile per gallon in my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500 Hemi, while towing my Harley.I am thrilled, and it takes a lot to get this 56 yr. old excited.  My previous best was 14-15 MPG on the highway, I came with 15.85 MPG on this trip, oh and I was not always going the speed limit, it is a Hemi after all. People this stuff just plan works, I've trusted my Ram with Royal Purple 5W-30 motor oil for over five years now, I've had it since new and it runs, I swear better than NEW!

It took me a while to install because I take my time to make sure everything fits correctly. I am pleased with the look it gives my 2001 HD Ultra Classic. Very cool. I did not have to splice any wires it was mostly plug and play. I did have to use the chrome ring and plate provided. Some of the wires I did not need, overall satisfied for now. Will update if anything changes after I ride tonight.

First off, this seems to be a good product. I have not been able to test it yet because....A word of warning: You MUST have a MASTER key for your vehicle in order to program the car to accept this key. (You don't program keys. You program the car...) Anyway, I didn't. I have a valet key. Therefore I am unable to put the car's module into programming mode. This is why I gave the item 4 stars - I don't know if the chip is any good. After I go to the lock smith and get the key working, I will update the review as far as how well the chip works.So here's a tip. If you have a Toyota vehicle, at least post 2009, and if your key has a BLACK plastic cap on it, it is likely a master key IF it has the original Toyota logo on it. If your key has a GREY plastic cap, it is likely to be a Valet key. Also, Valet keys will (should) not open the trunk.So long story short, make sure you have a master key. I am sadly going to need a trip to the locksmith...*sigh*On a good note, the key came well packaged, and well before the expected arrival date, so happy with that. :)

I keep a waverunner on a lake and needed something to keep the battery trickled charge.... this one fits the bill and at a good price. The kit comes with an extension cord to the solar panel so I could run the battery hookup all the way to the front of the waverunner and then put the cover over it... I then tie wrapped the solar panel on the wench.

Pros- Looks good, gets rid of the "amber" look in you clear housing  - Fits like the OEM bulb  - its a "Regular" bulb, so it works as a direct replacement. NO HYPERFLASH like LEDS do  - When ON, illuminates as AMBERCons- Not as bright as OEM fitted amber bulb or LEDSThese look awesome and clean up the amber tint that the stock bulbs emit when not activated (no power).  When turned on, the color is still amber, but since its like putting on mirror tint onto an amber bulb, the lumens are not as bright.  Basically they are dimmer but still are functional.  I tested them during the day and you can still see them activated, but once again OEM bulbs WILL BE BRIGHTER (OR LEDS but that is another different install).  Also, strangely the package said they are LED....but they are not...just regular filament type bulbs.

Tested this on a trip to Costco with 6 cases of water bottles (120 liters of water, about 265 lbs). Drove 45 mins home. The rise is claerly bent on one side, the basket is cockeyed, and it apears to have bent to one side at the hitch. If you are looking to carry weight, I would look elsewhere. Pics show wonky carrier and a view of how it seems to have twisted in the hitch receiver.

I bought this one over a competitor based solely on the reviews and on the price.  $150 and then another $20 rebate?!  Can't beat that.  Some mentioned the instructions to be lacking.  I found them OK til the middle and then it seemed like they glazed over stuff or left steps out.  But overall it was pretty easy to do.  Took about a half hour in my driveway. I actually notice the tone of my Magnaflow exhaust is QUIETER.  I am somewhat surprised there.  The truck also seems to rev a bit quicker and smoother too.

I received the seat covers on time. Box was free of damage. Took them out and installed them in about 15-20 minutes. Not very hard if you have experience installing seat covers. Now to the details. Fabric I don't see lasting for years to come, but then what can you expect. They are only $15.00. Remember that people. :) I paid $25.00 for the ones these replaced and they didn't even last a year. I put these on a 2017 Hyundai elantra and they fit pretty good. What I liked is there's two straps that go from the back to the front that you can adjust the tightness. What I also liked is these have a little pouch on the back that I can put my sun visor in, instead of leaving it on the floor. There are also 4 straps That secure the seat cover from left to right ( Remember LEFT TO RIGHT. NOT FRONT TO BACK). Now depending on your seat will determine on if you have to adjust these or not. My seats will need adjusting ( as you can see in the picture) What I'm going to do is tie a knot in one if the straps to make it smaller and then use the clamps provided to secure them together. ( remember you have 4 straps on each seat, total 8 but only 4 clamps, so yes they connect together) .Now for the instructions. Instructions are basic but if you have experience putting on seat covers  you probably won't need them. Myself I just looked at everything  and knew what I needed to do. However if you are having troubles they actually offer a video on how to put these on as well.See picture Overall for $15.00 I'm happy with them.

I should have used water to detail my interior with. It was left just as many streaks as this product did. It's not even about the lack of sheen, that's a personal choice. But it really doesn't do the trick in my opinion. Search elsewhere and don't waste your money. There are better products for less out there. Mothers VLR isn't high sheen, costs about the same if not less, and does a better job.

Installed 4 on my 24 foot camper. Just did a 1,000 mile round trip and they are doing fine. My wheels have no wiggle in them at all and the hubs stayed cool. I packed them by hand (The correct way) with Lithium / Molly bearing grease. The bearings are made in China and have some play in them. They shouldn't have that much play in my opinion. The ones installed in the front hubs on my 1968 GMC are OEM bearings made in the USA and they have no play in them. There is a very big difference in quality from a USA made product vs China made. 4 stars for fitting and working -1 for poor quality.

I have a 2001 Tacoma (4WD, 2 door), and bought this to use as a rear recovery point for offroading, so that I could hang a D-ring shackle receiver off of it. Install took about two hours by myself, with air tools. An extra set of hands would have been nice, but it's certainly doable alone. As with any older vehicle, getting some of the bits loose takes a little elbow grease so if your truck is older you'll definitely either want to use a compressor or copious amounts of WD40.Some notes - the way this is designed, there are two cutouts that the bumper mounts need to slip into from the side. My bumper mounts were unfortunately rusted to my bumper itself (old truck, New England winters) so I had to remove the bumper with the mounts attached. To that end, getting it back on was a bit tricker than it would have been if I could have removed both ends of the mounts (from the frame, and from the bumper).My truck had the factory frame replacement recall done to it, so it may be part of the reason - but this did not 100% line up with the stock mounting holes. It took a little finessing with a rubber mallet to get in there correctly, and even then I had to drill out the rearmost mounting hole slightly. This basically sandwiches between the frame and the stock bumper mounts, so when you screw it back in you need everything to line up so that you can go through the bumper mount, then the Curt mount, then back into the frame.All in all not too bad and certainly worth the DIY time vs. paying a local shop upwards of $300 for one installed.

GREEN FILTER 7159 installed on 2014 FORD FOCUS SEDAN AUTOMATIC.  For 50 bucks you can't go wrong i purchased to hopefully solve  throttle lag at take off! i am use to Honda's instant throttle response. It helped very little in that aspect but is better than stock any day. I do notice more torque when i launch from stopped position i installed filter in under 5 min cover fit perfectly. Tools needed a ratchet  6in or larger extension 8mm socket . I gave 5 stars because it is well made washable the nice deep sound my car makes when accelerating. I am going on a vegas trip from So.

I really don't understand why the bad reviews on this keychain.  I needed a nice looking key ring that could hold my three sets of keys: my home, my office and my personal file furnitures (8 keys in total).  I found that on this key fob and better yet, with BMW's logo to match my car's keychain.I haven't had a single problem with it, I've never experienced keys getting lose.  It is very well made, strong enough to take the beating I put to it (drops, in and out of pockets, etc).  It might be possible that those with many problems either got a defective one or are using like 20+ keys on it.I own this key fob since Oct. 12 and it works just like the first day I placed my keys in it. (I'll try to upload a picture so you can see).

My 2005 Ex Element side airbag: These visors fit perfectly and look better than the Honda part. I am very satisfied. Read the instructions on how to install and take your time. Make sure that the groove lines up at the mirror first then check lines against the back BEFORE you apply the entire length of tape. Tested at high speed and there is no noticeable noise. They are quiet. Definitely buy...

The orifice tube Is a very low priced component but it is also an extremely important part of the AC system. It serves two purposes, it filters out most contaminants from the oil and liquid refrigerant and also provides the correct pressure differential that is crucial to the proper and efficient performance of an air conditioning system.A partially clogged orifice tube will not provide the proper reduction of refrigerant pressure which will translate in inefficient cooling of passenger compartment air and increased strain on the compressor and other components. A severely or completely obstructed orifice tube will inevitably result in compresor failure.Before recharging your AC system always replace the orifice  tube, the few "extra" dollars spent and minimal additional repair work will go a long way towards ensuring the system operates as efficiently as it can operate and lasts as long as it should last.This orifice tube fit my 2003 GMC Yukon XL with rear AC perfectly. I understand there are two different sizes of orifice tubes and newer or different trucks use the "2nd design", which is larger in diameter.The outside diameter of the AC line where the (1st design) orifice tube is housed on my truck is exactly .500", if the line is larger than that, it means it takes the "2nd design" orifice tube.Overall I'm satisfied wit the quality of this AC Delco part, and recommend it to any one planning to work an air conditioning system.I have attached a picture of the orifice tube removed, which shows significant obstruction caused by very fine metal shavings.An important word of caution, i f you intent to work on your AC and if the system is still pressurized, please take it to a professional shop an have the system purged or drained by a professional certified technician using the correct equipment and procedures.

This product is fantastic for light rust and certain kinds of rusted metals, but its effectiveness varies a bit. It always eats off the rust, but the resulting surface might be totally like-new or have a new non-rust substance where the rust was. I tested it on some old tools, and the result on hand tools was remarkable. The wrenches (Craftsman steel alloy) lost the rust, but didn't look as good afterward.Regarding the photos: the one on linoleum is the after (sorry for mediocre lighting), concrete is the before, in liquid is the during. The pilers were really spectacularly de-rusted. Same with the Craftsman philips screwdriver. The file looked much better, the prybar was great, and the needle nose pliers were successes. The wrenches were improved, but not perfect. A bit of grinding work fixed them up, though.Pros:-Removes rust! I'm still hoping to try it on some vehicular rust, but it works great for hand tools.-Non-toxic, so I wasn't worried about it burning off my skin.-I used it at below the recommended temperature one round, but it still worked great.-Simple to use. Just soak the items, wash with water, dry, and you're done.-Can be used multiple times.Cons:-Won't work every miracle you might want. For example, don't expect it to release a set of pliers that has rusted shut. It helped on one I tried, but wasn't magic (WD-40 was more effective).-Doesn't stop rust moving forward from the treatment. You will want to put on oil or WD-40 or paint very soon, because the metal will re-rust.Other thoughts:-The stuff is a bit sticky and oily.

Idler for Alternator / Water Pump on over 150 BMW's. Direct fit and made in Canada - Not China!If your ride has over 100K miles and is squealing at idle and under load, this will take care of it.Also, while you're at it, replace the rest of the Idlers and the Main Belt Tensioner as they all tend to go bad at the same time.

WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG?!?  this is the one of the best purchases I have ever made.  the photo will show you how simple it is to use and how accurate you can be once you have used it once or twice.  the magnets are strong and the telescopic shafts work great for line of sight.  the adjustable shaft-angle is also a nice feature. this is not a criticism but they are not a "heavy duty" product but I think for 9 out of 10 applications their durability is completely acceptable.  I just thought it was important to make that clear.  Again, why did I wait so long when my spouse and I had so many tense times attaching our 5th wheel campers.  that headache is over...  THANK YOU FOR A GREAT PRODUCT!

I love these fender flares!!! They give the Jeep a very aggressive look and are made very well. Only problem is that if its raining or the ground is wet and you have the doors off, these fenders will not spot water from being sprayed into your Jeep by the wheels, but its a Jeep so it doesn't matter ;).Additionally, I cut the well liner that came with the stock fenders and attached them to the Jeep with some of the 10mm screws from the stock fenders in the front and just used the plastic rivets to attach the well liner in the back. Holding up great.

So far, so good. Everything arrived in good shape. No crushed box or rips. Everything was accounted for.I installed the top myself, and I have to say, it was pretty easy as installation goes. The hardest part was just lining it up on the rails before tightening it down. I eyeballed it about 6 times from one side to the other before locking it in place. The foam strips provided do a good job of almost completely sealing it off. I say almost because the design of the truck bed itself inherently leads to some small openings at the front corners. This is not a design flaw with the top. It's just how the truck is made.Folding up and securing the cover with the clips is pretty straightforward. The clamps fold up and tuck away out of the way, which is nice.The few things I would change would be to firstly, 86 the magnetic light fixture. I have a factory spray-on bed liner, and it doesn't do a good job of holding in place. The light itself is just an led with a reflective background. I have under rail lighting which does the job fine. The second thing I would change, and maybe it's just me - is the Tyger logo on the corner of the top. It's blue and stands out. My truck is silver and black. That blue grabs my eye every time. Good for the company to get free advertising,  but I'd prefer black.As far as sturdiness, I  have had it on for almost a week on local roads and highways at speed. It's been sunny and hot one day, and monsoon season the next. I have not had any water intrusion whatsoever in the bed; and my driveway is on an incline. I purposely parked it in both directions to see if there might be an opening for water at either end. Bone dry.The birds in my dogwood tree like to drop bombs on it. Washes off just fine.No sagging under the extreme sun and heat so far.No ridiculous flapping on the highway.That being said, I know this is still new, and that these things can change over time. If they do, I'll update this review, but so far, so good.As for expense, I think it's at a good price point for what you're getting, and way under what GM wants for the OEM covers.All in all, I am impressed by what I have seen so far.

Arrived today (2 days) in a very sturdy cardboard enclosure. I was a little worried about the packaging based on some reviews but it looks like they got the message. I anticipate the Optima product will be as reliable as all the other Optima batteries I have had over the years. I highly recommend this product and purchase method.

These are definitely rugged tail light protectors. Very sturdy and were pretty easy to install. I did use two of the existing screws to mount the guard, for the other two screws in the tail light I used the provided screws which were a little longer to account for the spacers. I also adjusted the feet on the guard to fit flush with the tail light by slightly bending them with my fingers. Just do a mock fit lining up the holes to determine if you need to make such adjustments. Over all I'm very happy with the look and fit.

Rubicon Express Oil Pan Skid Plate- 2013 JK 2DoorI bought this to cover my oil pan as it's cheaper to install this instead of dragging my Jeep out of the woods because I ripped the oil pan off. Out of the box this you'll find this skid plate is serious. It's made from heavy gauge steel and painted up nice with a durable black finish. Upon trying to install it I ran into a few issues. The two rear bolt holes did not line up exactly. Nothing a little drimmel couldn't fix. Then I noticed that between the same two rear tabs there was a little rubbing going on. I grinded down the edge and gave the clearance it needed. On the front however it took a bit more convincing with an angle grinder. The 3 tabs that secure the skid plate to the engine were a bit long and had to be grinded down so they wouldn't rub(especially the center tab). Then I noticed the plate would not slide into place because the far left tab(looking at it while lying on my back, underneath my rig) was getting hung up. I found that the left edge of the left tab needed to be trimmed. I taped it off and took about a 1/4" off and tried to fit it again and it fit perfectly. I took it off again and hit it with some black paint to prevent any future rust. I gave this a 4 star review simply because it wasn't exactly a bolt on part like it was advertised. I would recommend this part to anyone, just know your going have to put in a little work to get it to fit just right. Just remember DO NOT grind on your Jeep, only grind on your parts.

Works great as a replacement for a bad TFI unit for a 1989 Ford Mustang. Wish these were molded in black as opposed to the ugly grey they are made in. Definitely would look nicer and less obstrusive in appearance. Please make them in black!! looks as though it may be a generic TFI packaged in a Motorcraft box, but who knows. It does work as intended though.

Fits the GLC 300 as advertised and I love it has a bit of a "ridge" around the edges to help contain any spills that may occur.  This fits in the back with the second row of seats up so it's intended for protecting the cargo area only - i.e. if you fold the 2nd row seats down for extra cargo space, this liner does not cover the additional space.

I have been riding motorcycles for over 40 years. I own a RMZ250, Husqvarna CR 250 and a Honda CR 250. This is about my 300th motorcycle. I bought it to see what Chinese bikes were all about and have been impressed. It does not have much power compared to my other dirt bikes but it is a lot of fun ripping through the woods. The riding position is on the weird side with a higher than I am used to riding position. I removed the chain guard, kick stand, grips and bar pad the first hour. I put on Scott grips and a Renthal bar pad. Having electric start is nice and I do not have any carb issues that I read about. I run 92 octane Sunoco gas and it runs without any hesitation. I have been choosing this bike over the other lately because it is less work to ride. I did Loctite the whole bike so I have not had any loose bolts or lost any parts. I am 6'4" 240lbs. Power is fine. I climb everything with no issue. I have nothing bad to say about it.

Tricky to get it installed properly (especially the rear window clips), but was well worth it! I would much more prefer this style than the stick-on kind. Had an issue with the passenger front window not rolling up fully at first, so had to take it off and reinstall. Then leave the window fully rolled up for 2 days.

Perfect little kit.  The Harleys are famous for rattling things loose as the roll down the road.  Here is what you need to tighten that shifter back up before it falls off.  I have tried the tools on a Harley Heritage Softail.  Tools are there to remove the seat (Battery and fuses), adjust the grips (Torx) and change light bulbs (Phillips Screwdriver).  You will not rebuild the engine with this, but it has the basics covered well.  The case is nice and just the right size for the tools inside.Update:  I bought a different Harley and as soon as I got home I ordered another one of these kits.  These kits are just what you need and nothing more.  I prefer being able to patch things up on the road if I can rather than calling for a tow at the first problem.  This is just enough.

 I purchased this fuel filter as part of the process of revamping and overhauling my 2000 VW Jetta 2.0 AEG. I was replacing the fuel pump and decaying fuel hoses when I decided to replace the fuel filter as part of replacing the fuel system. My VW (manual transmission) has 260,000 miles and a fuel filter change was overdue. I have decided to continue driving it as I have replaced quite a bit of parts and it still drives well. When I removed the old fuel filter, it had dirt in the fuel, meaning that a change was overdue. I also bought the corresponding Bosch 0280160557 Fuel Pressure Regulator and the fuel filter bracket/clamp (see below)  Looking at the pictures, the parts look similar. The original VW fuel filter feels heavier and sturdier, but I have realized that aftermarket parts are just not as sturdy as original parts. This one has worked well though.  On a scale of 1-10 where 1 is replacing a fuse and 10 is replacing an engine, I would rate this a 5-6. It is not hard to change it yourself. It is just that the space underneath the car shall have you writhing if you don't have a professional car lift and are using wheel stands and a wheel jack to lift the car.  I would recommend this filter as part of revamping the fuel system. Below are instructions/directions on how to replace the fuel filter, assuming you are doing it yourself.  Before you start the job, save yourself time (and aggravation) by purchasing the Fuel filter Bracket/clamp for Volkswagen part # (N-024-522-6) or your corresponding vehicle's fuel filter bracket. Since you will be unscrewing an old clamp/bracket with a (most likely) rusty screw, it will be prudent to spend about $4 and use a new clamp/bracket. Also, removing the screw will most likely damage the top of the clamp/bracket screw, so using a new clamp/bracket is a no brainer! If you can or you have time and are planning on doing this, spray some PB blaster penetrator liquid on the screw a day or so before so that it can unscrew easily.  Relieve the fuel system pressure. Unhook battery terminals and the fuse that controls fuel pressure (fuse #28 on a 2000 VW Jetta I think, check your Haynes or other manual) Use the wheel jack and lift the vehicle on the rear passenger side. Place some vehicle jack stands to protect you just in case the whee jack fails. Make sure you have adequate space to work around the fuel filter. The fuel filter is located next to the fuel tank.  To remove the plastic fuel clamps from the metal filter, check carefully at some indentation that you press/depress to unclamp the fuel lines from the filter. You can use your fingers to depress the fuel line clasps. The fuel line clamps/clasps are black in color. Place rugs under the fuel lines, basically area under the fuel filter as you shall spill some fuel in the process. Remove the fuel filter clamp completely. Unclamp the white fuel line from the plastic clamp (that will slide out with the fuel filter clamp) and pull out the fuel filter. Have a plastic container ready to hold your old fuel filter as it has fuel and dirt in it.  On the new clamp/bracket, apply a dab of anti-seize so that it's easier to remove the screw the next time (hopefully there won't be a next time) Completely unscrew the clamp as you will need to run it in a metal bracket slot where the old bracket ran through. This metal bracket slot holds the clamp, which in turn holds the filter. Once you have run it through the slot, align the sides of the clamp and tighten slightly.  Push the fuel filter (and plastic fuel line holder which is curved to the shape of the fuel liner and align them) into the hole of the bracket. The fuel filter has arrows that point to the 'front' of the car and it has one side that has a 'lip' on it. This side with the lip is the one that 'goes to' or faces the front and is next to the blue, black and white fuel lines that are at a right angle. The side without a lip is at the back and only has the black fuel line that goes into it.  Once you have tightened it a bit and aligned the fuel filter to the 'lips' or edges of the metal bracket that holds the clamp that holds the filter, you can then insert the fuel line clamps into the fuel filter lines/openings. Make sure that the fuel line clamps are securely fastened into the filter as a non-secure connection shall result in fuel leaks.  Once the black fuel line clamps are in, tighten the screw of the fuel filter bracket completely. Once it is completely tight and flush with its metal bracket, insert the white fuel line onto the plastic black bracket/clamp that you have aligned to the metal fuel filter bracket. You may have unhooked a parking brake hook to provide you with easier access to the filter. Re-hook it and then reconnect the battery and return the fuse #28 for the fuel pressure/fuel pump. Put the ignition on (don't start the car) and activate the fuel pump. Check underneath to see if there are signs of fuel leakage. If not, go ahead and remove the jack stands and wheel jacks, remove the wheel chocks and start the car. Hopefully you have trouble-free driving for a while.

Best combo i've ever used -- for best performance;  1-place wax in sun or hot water then wash and clean car [may clay], ***-important -- use pre-wax cleaner on light cars ONLY!! Works better than other cleaner or cleaner wax. Do small area at a time or will be hard to remove  2- wax- shake well and apply a very thin coat to one section at a time [one bottle has lasted me through 3-cars and 2-SUV's]. I apply to trim & windows also. 3- As it starts to haze wipe off with soft terry cloth or towels, and Buff with clean towels, terry cloth, or buffer.  Major points of emphasis --- warm and shake wax b/f use -- apply very thin coat -- leaves a deep shine to body, trim and wheels. Make sure you buff the windows extra well or will leave a film noticed as sun comes in. I recommend applying a second coat no sooner than 1-hr after the first , gives it time to bond well. May use this or Collinite Marque D'Elegance Carnauba Paste Wax #915. r. Just don't use the #915 on trim or windows. The results you will find amazing!!! How long it lasts will depend on your habits of washing, climate and soaps you use, but it usually lasts much longer than anything you will find in auto or big box stores.I'm retired and do waxing and detailing part time as a hobby. So i've used a lot of products.

I was digging around in my 2001 Ford E-150 and I discovered a small box that said Viper. So I did some research and purchased this remote to pair up with the Van. After a couple of tries, I finally got the remote connected to the system and now I can arm and disarm the van, however, It does not physically lock or unlock the doors. I still have to manually do that by hand. It will lock and trigger the alarm if opened, but won't actually lock or unlock the doors. The van does have auto locks because it used to lock and unlock when shifted into park, but even that doesn't work anymore. Any help is appreciated. Other than that it has great range and it's a solid product.

Great water softener.  Even though everything is manually done (I used to have a system in a house, large tanks, automatic functions, etc.) it is easy to do and does not need to be done often.  I have been using mine for about four months and the water still comes out softer than without.  I have a garden hose set up at the spigot outside my RV, the water isn't as nice.I set mine up in my storage compartment and drilled two holes for hoses to the RV input.  I did this to avoid having the unit outside all the time and having to store and set back up every time.  Water in the tank would also freeze if left outside.  If you do this, be sure to place the tank in a 5-gallon bucket, it will develop condensation.  I attached a photo of my setup.  Really just needed a 4' hose between the tank and RV input with a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/90-Degree-Hose-Elbow/dp/B003BZD03K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">90 Degree Hose Elbow</a>&nbsp;at the input.  I also added the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/45-Degree-Hose-Elbow/dp/B003BZD06M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">45 Degree Hose Elbow</a>&nbsp;at the tank because the input does not rotate, making it hard to attach a 25' or 50' hose.  I also have a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Camco-Water-Filter/dp/B00BEDNXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Camco Water Filter</a>&nbsp;in line, which also helps but I currently do not have it on the softener but I am going to move it so it is inside my trailer for the winter.I am in an area with pretty normal water and didn't have a huge issue in the first place, this was recommended to me by another full time RVer (I had just started staying in an RV for work when I purchased this).  The main concern was actually yellowing of clothes after washing in the RV washing machine.Other reviews mentioning damaged Y and it not working after replacement.  I would assume those people did not replace the backpressure orifice on the normally unused side of the Y.  VERY IMPORTANT PIECE!  Cannot stress that enough.  That piece causes water to circulate in the tank to "re-soften" and move the salt around in the tank.  The Y is at max a $10 part.  DO NOT forget to keep the oriface.I highly recommend this item for anyone spending a lot of time in an RV.  This item works just as well as the previously mentioned full home system for a fraction of the cost.Update:  I recently put my&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Heated-Drinking-Water-Hose/dp/B01ABONAS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Heated Drinking Water Hose</a>&nbsp;in service and found out the holes I drilled were barely large enough to pull the heated hose through.  An extra 1/2" would have been perfect.

I bought these as replacements for the tail light / brake lights on my camper. And , well, they worked a little too good. as you can see in the included picture, they are significantly brighter than the incandescent bulb on the left. They were so bright, they were kind of washing out the red on the tail light lens.  While they would have been great for day use, I was concerned about using them at night.  They were so bright they could have easily been a distraction for a driver behind me in the dark. And applying the brakes would have only made the problem worse.They are very well made, and I do't think I'll have a problem using them.  Just not on the back of the camper.The size is slightly longer than a standard incandescent 3157 bulb, but not as wide.  The 3157 base is very easy to service, just a quick, straight pull of the bulb away from the socket to remove it, and a firm push to reinstall.  Not twisting or screwing needed.I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review

Light seems to be of good quality. While I haven't had the opportunity to use a great deal it does throw out some pretty good light for its size. I also have not had it long enough to expose to any adverse weather but with winter just around the corner it won't take long to see how it holds up in cold, wet weather.

The bars themselves are good quality, but the aluminum mounting hardware will have to be modified before it will slide in any rail. It is bent to the point it will not work. For some odd reason, the screws that mount the hardware to the rail is a Philips head screw....the hardware that mounts to the bar is a standard hex head.

I have been using this product for several years.  This is not your typical "tire gel" like coating that washes off in a month.  This is a dye. It dyes the plastic and does a really good job at it. It lasts years. I have never had to re-apply it.  I have used this on several vehicles. Fender flares, bumpers, side mirrors, side moldings, anything that is dark grey or black hard plastic. I have even dyed an entire dashboard and it looked great.Here is my application process that I find works very well.- Clean and dry the part.- If you are putting this on a large item like bumpers or fender flares I use a microfiber towel. Apply the dye to one area and immediately start rubbing it in evenly.  Once rubbed in and spread evenly you can fold the towel over and buff the area with a clean portion of the towel. This will help with darker or lighter spots.  When you do the next area of the bumper don't make a defined starting and stopping line.  You should overlap the area with the first area so that it blends well.  Use this same process for the entire part.  You will probably need to do a second coat.  The buffing in is key to a nice even finish.  This product is great.

After years of frustration using a cheap Harbor Freight air compressor, a hard 25' hose, a basic tire inflator nozzle and a pen style tire pressure gauge, and I finally decided to "treat myself" and bought some high quality equipment.  I bought a really nice, small California Air Tools compressor, highly rated coiled 25' hose and this JACO FlowPro Tire Inflator Guage and WOW...now I'm a happy camper!The gauge on this JACO unit is just the right size and very easy to read so you get the exact pressure in your tires that you want.  Inflate with the big lever, deflate with the smaller brass button on the side.  The high quality brass nozzle on the end of the hose has a little lever that you press, then push the nozzle onto the valve stem where it locks on.  I just inflated the tires on my two cars and two motorcycles and used to be a dreadful task is now quick and easy!  No wonder why this JACO unit gets such great reviews...it is awesome!  I recommend that you BUY IT!

I will re-edit this when I've put some heat to it and seen the miles it holds up to.As far as the product itself though, initial impressions are very good. I had the engine and transmission out of my miata so I could hopefully do this job the right way. There is a video out there of a gentleman putting one of these in with it installed and I can't imagine it would hold up as well. Reasons are numerous but I think the most important being there's no way you could get the tunnel clean enough for proper adhesion. Yes this product is extremely sticky, but like anything adhesive once you clog that surface up with contaminants it's going to lift off the surface and not provide the kind of bond intended.If you've come here, your car is too hot due to tunnel heat most likely. Though I suppose this product would work for lots of places. The aluminum side of this shield resembles the sort of thing I've seen on lots of new oem shields. It's got a cratered surface, it's somewhat reflective in nature. It is fairly stiff as a result, though it bends fairly easily.My application is for a race car (miata) and I've always found the tunnel gets just too hot from exhaust especially during the summer months (I usually don't have carpet either). So hopefully this helps this season. I've attached an image that shows how mine went in. I made sure to thoroughly clean the surface before-hand and started with the driver's side. Working it down and peeling back the adhesive protection layer of the product I was able to get it to finally adhere the way I wanted. Note, I cut my product with tin snips at the folds of the body to help ensure I didn't have any bubbles in where it applied. I don't believe there is any real way to not do this at least on a miata's tunnel. We'll see how well it works but I'm real hopeful it solves or at least helps to mitigate the heat issue. Hoping cutting it the way I did doesn't somehow ruin it's overall effectiveness or make it less long-lived. Will update with how it holds up.[...]

Installing them on my 1973 Holiday Rambler Trav'ler. These lights are a perfect match for the stock lights! The holes line up, the wires match up and lenses are the exact same size at the stock ones! Couldn't ask for better!

BE SURE TO CHECK WITH A DEALERSHIP PRIOR TO ORDERING!  I DID NOT BUY THIS ONE BUT WAS SOLD ONE THAT HAD INCORRECT AMP FUSES. CAN/WILL MELT WIRES OR THE FUSE BLOCK. DOUBLE CHECK YOUR ALTERNATOR AMPERAGE OUTPUT (if its a 120a alternator, you will need the 150a fuse in slot 5. If it's the 90a alternator,  you will need the 110a fuse in slot 5, etc.) The one I bought, from #1-#5(backwards when on battery, 5 is on the left (alternator wire)) #1 is a 30a, 2 is 40, 3 50, 4 110 & 5 150. The car is supposed to have, #1 & 2 are 50's, 3 is a 40, 4 is 110 and 5 should also be a 110, 90amp alternator. Since I installed the wrong one, the system was allowing more AMPERAGE through a wire that was too small causing it to get hot, melt the wire and the plastic divider causing the 110 to arc to the 50 and basically flash fired the whole case. BE CAREFUL IN YOUR SELECTION. BEST BET, CONTACT DEALER FOR EXACT PART # FOR YOUR VIN #.  Learned my lesson!!

I replaced the stock, anemic sounding horn on my Yamaha WR250/X motorcycle with a pair of Wolo horns. Wired in parallel, these horns are obnoxiously loud, which is a good thing when you're on a 320lb motorcycle, trying to get the attention of cellphone wielding, stereo blasting, inattentive drivers.I'm very happy with the horns, Just a little curious as to how they'll hold up over time, due to the fact that unlike in automotive applications, these horns are hanging out in the open and will be subjected to the elements.

This is a great replacement mirror.  My girlfriend smashed hers when she was driving and a trash can leaped out of nowhere into her car.  That's her story and she's sticking to it.  It is MANUAL meaning it has the little toggle to adjust the mirror manually from inside of the car.  So if you have a motorized/electronic mirror you need to buy a different product. This mounts easily with the three nuts (not included) from your original mirror.  Also it's worth noting the skull cap (the colored panel on the front of the mirror) that it comes with is black.  I managed to salvage the white one from her original mirror to stick it on for the picture.

Appears to be well built and has been working well for 600+ miles which include dirt roads and speed up to 120 mph.The mount is metal unlike another brands (one of which I tried and the LED died in 5 minutes and the mount broke in 30 miles).  When it arrived it had the single line lens on it BUT it ships with the correct lens in a little package.  It took all of 30 seconds to change out the lens.  I have it installed under the fender on my motorcycle and you cannot see the unit from the back nor can you tell where the light it coming from.  All you see is the design on the ground behind the bike.  I like that the power converter box and the light have a connector between them as it means I had more options when running the wires.My only gripe is that the wires that you connect the power and ground to are small, as in 22 gauge or so.  The wires on the motorcycle are 18 gauge and connecting those dissimilar sizes was interesting since I was trying to cover the connection with heat shrink.I'll update this review as I get more miles on the motorcycle and I'll get a picture of it.

It fits my 2016 ram 1500 crew cab perfectly . I see some improved little things that differed from the bed cover I purchased for my 2014 ram 1500 quad cab.1. Adjustable secure strap for when rolled back.2. Single centered handle pull release cable.3. More durable weather stripping not only for bulkhead side but tailgate also.4 The tensioners for the bed cover itself accessible from the tailgate end are very nice.One person install took me about 45min. Tools needed where a 14mm 17mm socket. Too easy! 5 stars.

This product is a great OBD2 live heads up display! It has a variety of different sensors and features which are all very tuneable to make sure they are just right for your car. Every single setting on here is 100% changeable which is absolutely great! One of my favorite sensors is the shift light/alarm which can be very helpful in a modified car or can be used by anyone who has a faulty meter on there dash. It can even clear engine codes! This product does everything that a normal Obd2 scanner does with torque pro without having to use your phone. Definitely something you don't see everyday and is definitely a attention grabber. Pro: Extremely Tunable, Plug and Play, Variety of sensors, Bright and Auto Adjusts, Metric and US Standard, Good Build Quality Con: Difficult to get reflection perfect, RPM does lag just a little, Not wireless, Refresh rate a little slow, Adjusting can be hard to figure out, Fuel Consumption in L/H not MPG *Quick tip, if you find your reflector is getting dirty on the adhesive because you messed with it, just use some packaging tape and stick it to the reflector side and pull it off to get any dirt or dust out of the reflector*

I bought my 2015 F150 Lariat last week and knew I needed to have a bed cover. I was worried when I started browsing the forums and everyone was talking about covers that were a minimum of $800! I really like the look of the tri-fold's, however I very much dislike the practicality (can only partially fold to expose the bed, or block your back window). This cover exceeds my expectations, and at an excellent price! Took about 30 minutes to install, with the most difficult part being getting the side rails level.  I started with the outside clamps and had to loosen and readjust a few times to get the weatherstrip to line up perfect with the edge.  Clamps were a bit annoying, but once you figure them out they work well.  I have a line-X spray in bed liner and that caused no issues.The only issue i had with quality was that metal on the back rail was bent where you slide in one of the carriage bolts and it wouldn't fit, however an easy fix was sliding it in from the other side all the way across.  Easy fix.  Also, I am just now noticing the "Elite" cover is only $30 more than this one, not sure why I didn't spend the extra few bucks for something that is advertised as a far superior product (no fade, waterproof, mold proof, etc). Oh well, on day one this current cover looks great! Also, driving on the highway at 75mph the cover moves a bit, but I hear no noise. Maybe just a little with the windows down, but definitely nothing with them up. Hope this cover lasts for many years to come!

I prefer brush painting and didn't want to spray so I opted for a product with good reviews all around: G2 Caliper Paint, a two part epoxy.The Good:-Brush on (precision and don't have to worry about accidental over spray)-You don't have to mask off everything like you do with sprays (recommended but not necessary if you have steady hands)-Easy to use-Directions are easy to follow-Vibrant and Shiny-It comes in a kit that includes everything you need even the brake cleanerThe Bad:-One of the priciest DIY options ($34.20 on eBay (as of 5/25/11) was the cheapest I could find)-These must be hung to paint them completely (I didn't, I'll explain below)-After the actuator is mixed with the paint you only have a 4 hour window to paint everything you need to paint: No room for touchups unless you buy another kit.-You can't buy just the actuator and paint, you have to buy the whole kitSummaryI purchased re-manufactured calipers for a brake over-hall and painted them before installing. You can paint them while on the vehicle but I wanted them completely painted - something you can only do if they are not installed.It comes with a sponge brush that I used for most of it but used a small brush I had lying around for the intricate parts. I recommend getting a small brush.I also recommend hanging them so you can reach everything without setting it down. I didn't think of this beforehand and I wish I had. Since you only have a four hour window to use the paint after mixing the actuator and paint you can't paint half a caliper and come back another day to paint the other half. I waited 15 minutes between coats but that wasn't long enough as the paint still came off a little while the calipers were resting. You can't come back later to touch up little misses or anything so do yourself a favor: hang the calipers when painting them!At six inches you can see the little mistakes I made (not the paint's fault, they're my mistakes) but outside of that they look outstanding. Rarely will anyone come close enough to see them so overall I am happy with the results.Despite the imperfections and other options on the market I would purchase the G2 system again.

Great product! Best price and you won't regret buying it. Aluminum ones cost $300+ and this one cost half of that (order reusable gasket - don't use the cork gasket it comes with $29 amazon). You won't need to upgrade your filter (I had a 4x4 filter) b/c theres a ledge built into the pan.What I forgot to do was remove my old magnet and install onto this pan. The magnetic bolt they include has a surface area of 3mm width by 6mm height???? Thats pathetic.7.3 4r100 (all years) take 7 quarts to drain and fill so with this pan, you need another 7qt for a total of 14qt. I used merc v and I reused my old fluid + 7 new. If its not black/brown/metallic flakes you had better reuse it or you're just throwing money away. I reuse antifreeze too - they do not go bad unless yours is tainted with fuel or rust.The temperature sensor is all the way on the bottom - another source to drain your fluids during regular fluid changes.Cheers!

I would like to give this top a Negative 1 as it has wasted allot of my time. It doesn't fit and will not stay on. Plus it looks awful because the ends on the windshield channel do not lock in. This is a really nice jeep and the cheap top make it look bad. I want to return it and the channel but have not received an authorization yet.

This is an excellent hook for car organization.  It fits well, it holds well.  Simple but effective.  The hooks fit on the back of headrest. The position of the headrest is very important for safety during a crash so be aware that the hooks lift the head rest about 3/4".  For a short driver like myself it raised the headrest from the optimal position for the neck protection. So I cannot use it the driver's side but it works well on the passenger side where the headrest is not in the lowest position.  Putting the hooks on the passenger side actually worked out very well because  I can reach my purse from the driver's seat.These hooks are provided by 365DIY for testing and review.Ali Julia review

When if comes time to recover your vehicle using your winch or a Hi Lift jack, you need to attach to something.  Sometimes it might be another vehicle, but sometimes you don't have anything but trees.It is not good for your winch cable to be wrapped around things and hooked to itself.  It's not good for trees either.  The cable can cut the bark and kill the tree.  You could use a tow strap but they're designed to stretch, which is not what you want when you're trying to winch.That's where the tree strap comes in.  It provides a safe anchor point for your recovery.  The strap is designed to support the forces of winching without stretching.  They also protect the tree from damage.If you buy a winch, get yourself a tree strap, a few d-shackles (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/WARN-13047-D-Shackle-0-75-in-Shackle-w-0-875-in-Pin-Dia-For-M6000-And-Larger-Winches/dp/B0002RR20W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">WARN 13047 D-Shackle; 0.75 in.

It kind of worked...but it doesn't fit the crank very well and slips off relatively easily.  However, it was critical when I was put 180 foot/lbs of torque on the crank pulley bolt after I got the new belt on the engine.  For removing the crank pulley bolt, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/dp/B00RGNCV1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Lisle 77080 19 mm Harmonic Balancer Socketfor Honda</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/DEWALT-DCF899P1-20V-MAX-XR-Brushless-High-Torque-1-2-34-Impact-Wrench-Kit-with-Detent-Anvil/dp/B00X52TWA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">DEWALT DCF899P1 20V MAX XR Brushless High Torque 1/2" Impact Wrench Kit with Detent Anvil</a>.  Those two will take the bolt off in seconds.I'd say 5 stars if they could get it to fit the crank pulley a little better, but I'm sure there's some good reason why they have it be a little loose...who knows. I am not affiliated with the manufacturer or a distributor.

I purchased this motor for a 2.5ci (2500lb) warn winch that the motor/armature was defective. The motor would overheat and stop working after 10-15 seconds of operation and smoke. This replacement motor from Amazon looks to be exact oem replacement except for no Warn decal. Installation was easy. Remove 2 nuts from new motor and discard plastic cover. Make sure you do not lose the thrust washer on shaft - see pic #1To verify if your warn motor/armature is defective, remove armature from housing and check with a volt-ohm meter, if your meter has an alarm it will beep when zeroing, if not it should read .000 when touching negative and positive probes together.Place negative probe on one of the lugs/bars of commutator and touch the positive probe to the remaining commutator lugs/bars one by one until you've tested each bar/lug while noting each of the readings... as can be seen in pics below the original warn motor is defective. The 3 lugs/bars that I marked with white dots have resistance signifying that three of the windings are either broken or burnt causing motor to malfunction.... only takes one bar/lug to have resistance and your warn motor is defective. A good motor will read .ooo on every lug/bar  -  see pic # 2 and # 3I deducted one star because my new motor was defective out of the box, motor would not operate after installation, upon removal and inspection I noted the burnt brush as can be seen in photo below... Instead of sending back I removed brushes from original motor and installed in new one....  see pic # 4Excuse the quality of pics, it was challenging trying to hold the leads of multimeter and take pics at same time...

Camco has come up with a clever and convenient way to organize and transport leveling blocks.  These blocks will support the weight of my 13-ton motorhome without damage.  They will interlock with my Tri-Lynx 00015 Lynx Levelers to make a taller stack when I need the extra height.  Although the Tri-Lynx 00019 LynxCaps won't mate with these leveling blocks, as long as I have a Tri-Lynx 00015 Lynx Leveler on top I can use a LynxCap to cap the stack.  I can use these under my tires or to extend the range of my coach's hydraulic leveling jacks.Leveling blocks such as these are much cleaner, neater and weigh less than wooden blocks and, of course, won't rot.  Aside from being handy for leveling my RV at campsites, I've used them under my tires to gain traction and get out of being stuck in mud.  Once used in that application, they're easy to wash clean before storage.  Having Camco's clever carrying handle to hold the stack is much more convenient than storing leveling blocks in a zip-up bag.  It's difficult for me to imagine being a serious RV camper without having leveling blocks, such as these, available to compensate for off-level campsites.  The photo that I've included shows these blocks supporting the entire front-end weight of my motorhome with its Triton V-10 engine.

I flushed/refilled my fluid around 70k, shortly after I got the car, and I used Nissan OEM NS-2 fluid with great results.  But I realized I hadn't cleaned the pan.  So that sat in the back of my mind for about 30k miles, then I dropped the pan, cleaned it (barely anything on the magnets, pan itself was spotless, go figure), and since the first flush this stuff had come out for about 1/2 the price of the NS-2, and it said NS-2 compatible, so I flushed/refilled with it because I'll take a chance on a good deal (I have Amazon Prime after all).Everything was fine until now, about 10k miles later, when I start hearing a dull, low-pitched whine around 40 mph.  Goes away around 50, returns a quieter around 60, and goes away up to 80 mph as far as I can tell (haven't tested faster, sorry).  So I'm thinking wheel bearing.  Bearings are silent when I turn the wheels by hand, no play... so I fire up the car and let it idle in drive up on the jacks, and I'm hearing a... not quite grinding, more of a scraping... kind of like a bad wheel bearing except... it's not coming from the wheels.  It's coming from my differential case... awesome.So I drop my pan to make sure I'm not just shaving off my diff gears, and I'm not, which is good, but the magnets are black and filmy with metal dust... so I AM wearing through my transmission at least 10x faster than with the NS-2 fluid.  Not acceptable.  I refilled with the only thing I had on hand, which was this stuff, but I'll be flushing and getting the good ol' OEM stuff back in there before I do any further damage.False advertising Valvoline.  I might as well have put heavy motor oil in my CVT for all the good this stuff did.  I was going to put the remaining 1/2 qt. in my trunk to top off if needed, and I came upon a genuine NS-2 bottle back there, so I decided to compare the colors (because I thought the Valvoline looked lighter, but I'd forgotten I had a little NS-2 left to compare until I stumbled upon it).  See attached pics.  Not the same dye, probably not the same formula, definitely inferior results. 0/5 would not buy again.

The picture for the red one shows a solid red one. That's what I wanted. The one I received is red on one side, and white on the other. My intial though upon opening the box was, " D@mit , I have to return these." Luckily my Honda has enough white in it that the colors will match, so I'll just deal with it.When you order these, namely the red ones, understand you will get this two tone color scheme.

Bought these to replace the ugly yellowish DRL bulbs on my 2010 camaro rs.  They were a bit of a pain to install.  They barely fit in the bulb housing.  They work as described and are quite brite.  Up close your light looks almost like a disco ball because of all the little led's.  From far away they look like normal bright white lights.  Cant comment on reliability as i just installed them a week ago.

Just received bestow and got it all on and the back window is way too long and doesn't fit my Jeep Wrangler 2 door.  Can you replace the back window to one that fits!  The zippers are much longer than the other windows!Update I am still waiting on my correct window which was told would be special order 2 - 4 weeks but I really am happy with the top itself!  I really like the safari top in the sunshine and can take the side windows out and put back on easily!  Hope my back window comes before the weather gets bad again!Update Bestop sent the right window and I am a happy camper!  Great Company!  Thanks Bestop!

Was looking for a very durable clearcoat to use on headlights. This seemed strong enough to last longer than using a Rustoleum like spray. What peaked my interest was that USC describes the spray as 'polishable'.When doing prepping the lights I removed all the clear coat and sanded from 350grit to 3.5k grit. Then prepped the raw plastic with rubbing alcohol. The second pic is prior to USC spray.  I did a light single coat, waited 10 minutes then added a heavier second coat, waited 10 minutes, then a 'normal' third coat. Have the lights two days in the garage to cure. The outside pic is the final product.I did go over the coat with a 3.5k grit sand paper and polished with a headlight restore polish and a finalizing polish to make smooth and even more clear.The durability under polish defiantly stood up to USC claims. There was no marring or cuts period in the clear coat, and the light sanding prior to polish were completely lifted.Curious as to how long this clear coat will last on the headlights, but I'm optimistic. A definite try for your headlight restore. And I will buy again when doing another headlight.

2013 Xterra S. Easy 1 person installation. Just follow the instructions. I dropped my spare, loosened my exhaust (per the instructions), removed the 4 lower bumper bolts, lifted the hitch into place, secured it with the 2ea M12 bolts (finger tight), rotated it into place, drove in the 4 replacement bumper bolts. Tightened exhaust and replaced my spare. Air tools are recommended. My hitch fit perfectly. No pounding required as mentioned in other reviews. 1 hour tops. With a short break.

Caution - these are the Akebono style, not the Teves style.  Jeep, in all their wisdom, apparently used two different style brake calipers for at least the 2000 production run of the Grand Cherokee Laredo - probably other years and models as well.  Amazon doesn't track this and I wasn't aware of this when I ordered, so I trusted Amazon's "Guaranteed Fit for your Vehicle" statement.  The pads that arrived did not fit, nor come anywhere close.  See the attached photo - the new pads are these ACDelco's (top), with the bottom being the well worn pads that fit my Jeep.  The top style is the Akebono style, the bottom is for the Teves style.The pads themselves look like they're well enough made, not top of the line but good for the price.  I wish I could write a review to caution other buyers without having to review the product itself, so I am forced to give 2 stars for the fact that even though you'll be told these fit your vehicle, there is nothing in the description that tells you whether they are for the Teves or Akebono style caliper, and if you didn't know that Jeep made multiple styles, then you'd have a 50/50 chance of getting it wrong.For what it's worth - if you look at your calipers and they have a big wire thing attached to the front (the face of the caliper furthest outside on the vehicle), then you have the Teves style and these pads WILL NOT WORK.  If you don't have a wire clip, then these will work because you have the Akebono style.Amazon / ACDelco really should mention the style these pads are for in the description.

With the flock of lithium ion battery's coming at out at lower prices, gone are the days where you needed to carry a huge bulky boxed jump starter to get your car up and running. With that in mind, there are now plenty of these jump starters online and some of them are superb and some are just ok. In this case, there were some things I really liked about it and some things that I did not.To begin with, here is what is included in the box:- Power bank 12000 mAh- Jumper cables- Different charging ports for laptops (unspecified)What are the pros:- The power bank works as a charging station- Built in LED lights- Can be used to start your car with a dead battery- Seems like heavy duty material and should last you- high capacityWhat are the cons:- No case included. How and where will you place this in the car? It comes in a cardboard box.- The jumper cables are cheaply made- No cell phone charging cables provided (micro usb/lightning cables)-The charging cables for the laptops are pretty useless.FInal thoughts:I tried using it for about a week and I can say that it does hold a charge for the most part but I cant tell if its actually 12000 mAh since it only charged my iPad Air about 1.5 times which totals to 10000mAh. With that in mind, some batteries need to be used several times in order to get the full capacity as listed. The fact that there is no smartphone cables provided and no case to go with it when competitors for the same price are offering it, I find it hard to recommend it but as a stand alone product, it does a good job.I received the following at a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

Very impressed with the easy on and off as well as the depth and shine of this product.  It was really humid in my garage and it was still hazing up quickly and coming off clean.  I didn't experience any issues with the wax staining black trim, though I was careful to minimize contact.  Very happy with the results.

Awesome floor mats! Matched perfectly my interior car. Good material, you won't regret it. I sold my red car and bought a white one with blue interior, so i ordered new blue mats, same type and brand!

Nice option @ $10.99 - LEDs These are pretty standard well functioning replacements with the upgraded coolness factor of the blue back light and the 3rd wire for running lights. My blinkers have been tied into the break lights for years via combo Circuit so if you have that or don't want to use the 3rd wire, splice the red and blue together and connect to hot wire, black to ground.I really like the blue and it blinks too. As running lights the 9 yellow LEDs are great & the 4 LED blues make great marker lights. The mount hole needs 13/32" a bit bigger then standard - easy enough to drill out. The black mount between the light housing and mounting bolt is rubberized so it will move/flex before breaking - in case you bump it, that's also in the ++ column. Ok not the definitive brightest day light LEDs but def safety conscious just fine. Night time is awesome!So, overall 4 stars for all the functionality and coolness factor and bang for the buck. Not 5 because I still have no idea how many watts I'm burning with these and I'm sure there are brighter LEDs also at a higher price - but these will not be replaced until they brake. Very satisfied!! :0)

As other reviewers have mentioned, beware of this kit.  I thought since it was EXEDY and an OEM replacement, I would be fine.  I bought this for my 2003 WRX, and Amazon says it fits my car.  I was having the engine replaced, so it just made sense to replace the clutch in the process.  This kit did NOT work with my car.  It was making a noise as soon as the mechanic started it.  The mechanic had to take the car apart again, this time all at cost to me because I had supplied the clutch kit.  Trying to save a little ended up costing me over $300 more in labor to redo this new clutch kit.  This shop works on a lot of WRXs, so they know what they are doing.  He bought a different OEM EXEDY kit from his supplier and it worked perfectly.  You can see in the photos that this clutch rubs in four places.  If you have an 02-03 WRX, I would steer clear.  This is an expensive gamble to take, as clutch replacement is a big job.  Amazon was good to accept the return.  I THINK this will fit other WRX models, but in the future I will always just buy the shop's parts for jobs that are extensive.  Then if it doesn't fit properly, they eat the cost of doing the job over.EDIT: Just wanted to add the build date for my 03 is 9/2002.

I am a full timer, have been living in my RV for over a year now and I seriously waited way too long to purchase this! It took out at least, if not more than, 90% of giggle/wiggle out of the front end! It was pretty easy to assemble! Very pleased with the end result! Next purchase is a set of scissor jacks to stabilize the main room and then I won't even know I'm in an RV anymore!

I have a 2003 (2002.5) Infiniti G35 with Factory Navigation and Premium Sound (Bose). After suffering for a long time without A/C controls and Music (bad Audio Finisher Circuit Board I think) I decided to upgrade my Stereo to something newer, rather than get the old system fixed and pay more ($1600 for the part, and not eligible for free replacement under the recall anymore)I wanted to keep the factory navigation if possible. Thanks to some info posted by Wrathernaut on g35driver site, I was learned that it was possible to do so. I showed the youtube video (g35 metra 2) to my technician, who was able to set things up. I have to wrestle a bit with the factory navigation to get it to pop back up - but I don't mess with it too often - so all good.If you are comparing price with the JDM kit, do consider that keeping the factory navigation cost me an extra 70 bucks in labor, which I believe the JDM does by default, plus it has OEM quality buttons.Here are the other things I bought along with the Metra Kit to get the unit replaced<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PAC-ROEMNIS2-Factory-Premium-Sound-Interface-Headunit-Replacement-For-Select-Nissan-Vehicles/dp/B000CE9OY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PAC ROEMNIS2 Factory Premium Sound Interface Headunit Replacement, For Select Nissan Vehicles</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Metra-40-NI10-Nissan-Antenna-Adapter/dp/B0002BESI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Metra 40-NI10 Nissan Antenna Adapter</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PAC-SWI-PS-Pioneer-and-Sony-Universal-Steering-Wheel-Radio-Interface/dp/B001EAWNVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PAC SWI-PS Pioneer and Sony Universal Steering Wheel Radio Interface</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pioneer-AVIC-Z140BH-2DIN-7-Touchscreen-In-Dash-Navigation-AV-Receiver/dp/B006Y444T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pioneer AVIC-Z140BH  2DIN 7" Touchscreen In-Dash Navigation AV Receiver</a>You may of course choose a different Stereo, I liked the Z150, but the Z140 was a good $240 cheaper at the time of purchase, and not much different.

I could not be more pleased with this set of grab handles.  The listing says they are made from solid steel.  You can believe that.  They look like steel tube but really are solid heavy bar steel. The set does not come with instructions of any kind but the installation is very straight forward and fit the factory bolt locations perfectly.  You will need a 1/2" socket to remove the front factory bolts and a 6mm allen wrench to install the handles.  The front handles are built for left and right. The two back handles are identical and you will need a 10mm socket to remove the factory bolts that hold the speaker to the roll cage.  And a 10mm allen wrench to install the handles.I bought the red set because I have black interior and thought the handles would be more visible if someone needed to grab something in a hurry.  It's a Jeep thing.  And the red really looks good against the black.  Each to his own there.

Wish I could leave 2 reviews. Of give the lights themself a 5 star! And the company a 3 star. Only for the fact that they sent me a what looked like a used light. The box wasn't even sealed, and was all scratched up and you could see on the plug where it had been installed. But still worked just fine. And the problem was solved quickly through Amazon. First I ordered only 1 to try them out. Wasn't impressed for this reason. But as soon as they resolved them I went ahead and ordered another light. And I don't regret it at all. The lights are awesome! They shine much matter than what they are priced at. Great cut off pattern, high beams reach out a long ways, very wide beam pattern from side to side, and a very even beam pattern. Also it's not stated in the description but when I got them they are stamped DOT and SAE certified so that was a big plus. So no issues when it comes to reinspecting my car. Over all the lights are awesome and would buy another pair if I had another car to put them on. Them sending a used unit was just a minor set back and not a big issue. It worked fine. There are a few quick picture. Of low beam, high beam against my garage door, and led vs clear Simi-sealed headlight. I'll try to get better ones when I have more time.

You get what you pay for. Do not think your getting a bull bar,brush guard or push bar. This is a light mount period.....that said it works great for that and adds a little bling. My jeep compass really has no front plate mount to work with so I drilled through the metal bumper support behind the front fascia with a long drill bit and installed with four 6 inch carriage bolts. Installed with two 4.5 inch driving lights. Total $51. Not bad....

I purchased this from a local detailing shop.  It does what it is intended to do.  It is a color changing wheel cleaner.  It will turn red as it encounters iron deposits from brake dust.  I am not a fan of the foaming sprayer as it tends to use more product.  It resembles this other wheel cleaner by Meguiar's other than the color (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/DUB-U1422-Wheel-Cleaner-22-oz/dp/B00G49NYT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">DUB U1422 Wheel Cleaner - 22 oz.</a>.It will require agitation with a brush to remove heavily caked on brake dust like any other wheel cleaner.Overall a very solid product at a great price.

Original: May 22, 2017I bought this for use with a bike rack, since the rack was too low. With this adapter, the bike rack is several inches higher and doesn't scrape the road anymore.I gave this only 4 stars because the adapter rubs the bumper on my Camry. (It might not rub on other cars) It would be better if the top section (2" part) was a little shorter or was angled away from the car. I'll probably grind 1/4" to 3/8" off the edge to fix it. (See attached picture)Update: Nov 30, 2017I did grind the edge and it's now much better - it doesn't rub against my bumper.

I didn't find these much brighter than a new set of stock lamps I replaced. The pattern is a bit more spread out, but seems more dim because of it. The units I received seemed to light up the drivers side of the road more than the passengers side. Even after I statistically adjusted them. These are not worth the cost to me. If your going to run high wattage bulbs they may be brighter but the issue of not illuminating the passengers side of road was an issue for me. I returned them and replaced the original. I'll say they were quality made, what would expect of the Hella brand. Just not what I thought they would be. Also a note that may of been an issue was the pattern on the glass of the units I received is opposite than the pictures in the listing,  One person noted the lamps I received may habe been for a right hand drive vehicle.??

Head light bulbs need to be focused in the area ahead of your vehicle.  LED bulbs need to be designed so they direct light the same way an incandescent light does.  These do NOT!  The light from these bulbs go out in a large circular design with concentric circles inside.  When you drive at night it gives the impression the lights aren't on because the light is going all over the place including into the eyes of on coming traffic.If the picture uploads you can compare 9006 incandescent on the left and Botlink LED 9006 on the right.

I installed this two days ago in addition to two other lights I already had and (so far) haven't had any issues with it. It fit like a glove behind the grill of my 05 Silverado and has plenty of clearance and doesn't seem to interfere with the cosmetics or prevent airflow to the radiator or engine. The lights are super bright and gives me a large range of visibility. I've read some other reviews from people who said their lights burnt out over time so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

Worked absolutely perfect.  Super easy install.  Took about an hour with me and a friend on the tools.  I bought this kit to level out the truck, after purchasing leveling leaf springs for the front that turned out to lift the front about 5 inches.  These blocks brought the rear up just enough to level the truck and allowed me to mount my 37" tires.  Very pleased.

My car is a 1998 Chrysler Sebring JXi, 2.5L V6 engine.It didn't do the job the first time i used it, for a car that had the trunk light on overnight by accident. Needed a jump from another vehicle. I bought a new battery after this.Then, it got really cold, so i charged it, and ended up using it with the new battery twice (with a full charge in between, of course). Both times, my car turned over after 2-4 tries. But my car would usually start after 2-4 tries without the jump starter, so I don't know if the car would have turned over anyway, or if this actually helped.I'm sure it's good for emergencies. My experience says to also have a set of jumper cables handy, as a reliable backup to this device.EDIT (February 2015): After trying to use this thing (with the same erratic results) occasionally for the past 15 months (and frequently in the last couple weeks), I've finally figured out the issue. The shape of the clamp causes it to have very little contact with my battery posts. The clamps are shaped like small triangles with a sharp point, like the letter "V." It pretty much looks like this:v v v^^^But the way they are spaced, it is not possible to get more than two tiny points on each side of the clamp to touch the battery post at once (and sometimes I can only manage 1 point of contact, if my hands are too cold or the wind is too strong). My battery posts are shaped like hexagons. I can get much more of the metal to contact the posts on my regular jumper cables, and the AAA jump starters get more contact as well.I'm waiting for my Clore JNC660 to arrive, and I will update this review and create a new one for that jump starter with the shape of those clamps, and they establish a better connection. Ultimately, the JNC300XL was too unreliable for me, most likely due to the inability to get good contact with my battery posts because of the shape of the clamps.UPDATE (October 2015): Just felt like posting my complete RELIEF that I no longer live in a cold weather area, and don't have to put up with this BS every winter!

Horrible product, added to my power steering reservior which had a small leak in the rack and pinion. Drove for about 300 miles, and the small leak turn into an oil spill, leaving a mess on my driveway. The car is currently disabled and is being fixed costing me $1,000 to fix. Lucas Oil did a better job slowing the leak.

Just as expected.The chrome finish is perfect and matches the factory nuts. The packaging is not the same as in the picture it comes in a plastic bag but still branded Honda. Comes with a small black storage pouch that straps around the tire iron. The pouch fits the key and spare nuts.On my 2018 accord the lock nut sticks out a tad bit more than the others but its fine doesnt stick out too much like the gorilla lock nuts did.

I had to contact seller because I had accidentally entered the wrong address when I first ordered the Rocker Sliders. They were able to fix the address prior to shipping and it got to the correct address quickly.  No damage noted on any of the parts.  The quality and design is excellent and looks great on my Jeep Wrangler!!  Finish is perfect and looks terrific. The only problem I had was on the driver's side rocker.  It was about 1/8th of an inch off on alignment with the mounting bolts.  I used a step down bit and was able to drill it (the rocker) out the small amount it needed to fit correctly.  Absolutely the best value for the price hands down!!!  I was able to install them by myself.  It was difficult but manageable.

Got it today and tried it on new Preston coolant and 2 used cars.  The reading is confusing.  All cold coolant.  No air bubbles in the tester.1. For new Preston Antifreeze/coolant 50/50 mix, the reading is accurate (see the first 2 pictures).2. For my 12 year used car with 200,000 miles on it (had a coolant flush at 100k), the reading shows the coolant is better than new Prestone.  See picture 3 and 4.3. For my 10 year used car with 86,000 miles on it (original coolant), the reading shows the coolant is better than new Prestone.  See picture 5 and 6.Did I read it correct?  Can someone please help?  Please comment.  Thanks.

This wrap looks great on my Mazda 3's interior. This wrap applies well, and actually sticks like it is supposed to- without the use of nasty adhesives. It comes off just as easily as it goes on.Long Term Update: over 6 months later, the wrap still looks just as it did in the pictures. No bubbles, No fading,  and no peeling if this wrap is applied correctly.1 year later: Still looks just like pictured; no fading, and it has a scratch-resistant quality to it. The only area that it is lifting on is a tight corner in which I messed up the adhesive by re-peeling it and redoing it. The area lifting is about half the diameter of an pencil's eraser,  so it is small, and has not peeled any further over the course of several weeks and months.

Someone had the lawn mower at the curb on trash day, and I couldn't get it to start. Narrowed it down to not having any spark and determined it was most likely the coil pack. Paid $15 for this coil pack, and after installing, started up and ran perfect. Sold the lawn mower for $100.

Great quality oil filter, cut open after 6,000 miles in service on a 2013 BMW R1200GS and found everything to look perfect. I noticed this oil change that there was literally no fuzz or any particles on the magnetic drain plug which makes me believe that this filter does an excellent job. Also appears to be very well constructed.

This worked as advertised on a 2005 GMC Yukon XL. I had replaced my DRL's (4114 Bulbs) and my parking lights (3157 bulbs) with LED's. This caused me to have the dreaded hyper-flashing turn signals. I bought this module hoping for a fix and it delivered. I've enclosed pictures comparing the original GM module and the Novita module. I've also taken a picture to show you exactly where this module is located (on an 05 GMC Yukon).It's a little hard to remove but just keep working at it, it'll come out. Also, make sure you put the new module in just like the old one (Pins K & E on the bottom).Hopefully this helps someone.

Like a dope I opened my tailgate on a tool that I had left on the bumper and put two dents in my new Ram Ecodiesel.  I hoped that the Ecodiesel badge would cover it.  It did and looks great.  Not exactly where I would have put it had I not had the dents but works great and is the exact same badge as already on the truck.

Finally found a led kit that worked with my BMW and Volvo! Easy to install totally plug and play. Trust me I went through a lot of hid kits and gave up as they flickered on the BMW. This led is pure white! No yellow or blue. Which I don't like at all.**if you want a no-Blue or no-yellow headlight led this is the product! Also in my pics the light can look a bit yellow but that's from the led parking light NOT the broview Kit. FYI.Didn't throw any codes on either 2007 BMW or 2010 Volvo. Booyah!I know it can be very frustrating if you have a European vehicle due to the onboard canbus/computer can be very picky on regulating voltage.The build in voltage regulator/canceller as you see in the photos is what does the job. NOT all voltage regulators are Equal!The build quality is amazing and the setup allows for tweaking the light spread on the housing with the included Allen wrench. It's a bit tricky as its really small and I thought I broke it! But didn't! Do not turn the Allen screw so much that it comes out. You only need a 1/4-1/2 turn to loosen. Key: at first it feels stuck and that it might not loosen but it will.**in the photos the low beam and fog lights are the 8000lm broview kits (here) and the high beam in pic is the 12000lm version...that is crazy bright and perfect for high beam. I personally think the 12000lm version is too bright as low beam.

This is a great product, especially when used after a compounding and polishing the car.  The only thing I would say is to apply a very thin coat and let it dry for at least 30 minutes.  When applying it to thick, it takes a lot longer for it dry.  This product comes off very easily so don't worry about leaving it on for too long.  I also used it on my windows so that the rain just glides off with the wind.  In the picture I provided you can see the depth of shine, but keep in mind I compounded and polished the car before I applied the power lock.

The levels are inexpensive but work just fine.  My one complaint was that I only got a sealed package with one level.  I told amazon and they sent me a package of 2.  Go figure I ended up with 3 levels for a couple of bucks.  I use these on my boat and boat lift.  I take the cheap sticky off the back and use 3M 4200 to install them.  I actually use one for a tilt indicator for my trim tabs.Thanks to Amazon Customer service this squeaks out as a positive review.ThanksGadget

Very easy to install if you know what your doing.  If you consider yourself handy and comfortable with taking things a part on a car, you will be just fine.I chose to remove my bumper instead of following the directions in the box (lowering exhaust)It made it so much easier for me to mount and cut the plastic bumper.  Some people might have issues with removing the bumper because theres hidden screws and pull tabs under the taillight area.  If you get to that point and give up, just follow the instructions on the box then.It fit perfectly in my 2014 jeep compass latitude 4x4 model. I also have the Magnaflow exhaust package and it didn't interfere whatsoever.  Some people complained about the exhaust getting close to the mount.. i have zero issues.The only gripe i had was cutting the plastic... Using a razer blade wasn't easy, so i used a small fine saw... Then filed the rough parts.  I spent more time cutting than installing the mount believe it or not.  Im very satisfied though.

I'm very picky with our cars, so I'm always trying to find new/better products. I've used spray waxes in the past and they were convenient, but none really wowed me. The 'synthetic' ICE wax I've been using for years is discontinued so I started looking for something else. I had heard about Smartwax brand stuff so I thought I would try this one. I know it's advertised as a waterless wash and wax but I still wash my car first, then I use this. It works very well and smells good! I think my only complaint is that like others have mentioned, one bottle does not last that long. Still, I would purchase it again. As far as longevity of the actual protection of the car's paint, it doesn't last any longer or shorter than other spray waxes. I use this when I'm too lazy to use the yellow Smartwax paste in the bottle as that takes longer. I would definitely recommend this. One of our cars is gray, one is beige, two are silver, and one is pearl white. Works great on all of them!

My Honda Accord 2002 did not come with a pouch for the owner's manual when I purchase the car and i did not want to damage the manual due to how excellent the condition it was. I am really glad i got this! The size is exactly perfect just barely fitting my owner's manual and still having space for my other documents. Another thing I love about this organizer is how many pocket it has, 5 interior pockets and 1 exterior zipper pocket that allow for crazy amount of storage for my documents. It's pretty large enough to hold what you need and small enough to fit in your glove box. Keep in mind that this might not work for everyone, every car has a different glove box size and different manual size. The reason why I give this a 4 stars instead of 5 is because the price and the quality of the organizer. It is very well made but at time it does feel flimsy and wish this was thicker. Over all great buy!!!

REALLY like these. Holy cow they are bright. I'm not a 16 year old new driver, I have been selling and installing lights for years.Now, the bad parts come first.1. VERY small gauge wires, causing them to bend and break over time. I covered the connections and wires around the base of the light with epoxy to prevent the issue (ruined 2 of them before making this modification)The epoxy method has held up without issue. I highly suggest you do that if they will be in a location where the wires can wiggle (like in a car...)2. Mounting. they come with sticky pads on the back, which are very sticky. quality adhesive. Mounting them somewhere in the interior of the car might yield OK results but exterior of the car they would not hold up past a few car washes for me. I hold them with zipties, but would be nice if they had mounting screw holes of some sort.BUUUUUT. They are amazingly bright. I used one as a license plate light...I was speeding home that same night and the cop mentioned how nice my really bright license plate light was. :)As floor lighting on the interior of the car, you can pick out individual pieces of dust on your floorboard.use them as underglow, they are much cheaper than underglow kits!I love them, I can't have enough of them laying around. I can always find a new use for them. My favorite LED in my supply.

When I received these the gaskets were stuck to the packaging because the seller does not wait for them to cure. BOTH taillights leak really bad and currently have water in them. The fact that its BOTH and not just one tells me that this is not a rare occurrence. The driver side also fits slightly crooked. I messaged the seller but still have not heard back. Hopefully I can get a set that work after spending this much money.

Perfect replacement for battery tray that was broken. Wish this came with the rubber grommet though. I couldn't easily remove the one from the old unit. I ended having to cut the tank off, put a hose clamp over the base of the grommet and screwing the clamp down to compress the grommet so I could then pop it out of the old tank. Not sure how others got that out of the old tank.

And they slip out of the bearing after one or two pulls. Ill post a video of this and pictures of the puller after trying to get one bearing out. I used a socket and a small sledgehammer and the bearing flew out after a couple of hits. Sometimes old tricks are the best tricks.

Overall this is just a piece of junk.  I've had one problem after another.  When the hitch was new, YES, there is a lot of "slop".  When you hit a bump, the hitch has so much freeplay you can feel it from the driver's seat!  Second the hitch corroded so badly after only a year or two, that the adjustment holes are no longer usable.  Finally the lock stopped working (key got stuck in the lock), despite oiling it regularly and keeping dust, sand, and salt away from it.The worst part is the customer service.  They ONLY WARRANTY THIS PRODUCT FOR 90 DAYS!!!  No matter what you find online, the warranty is 90 days!!  I filed a complaint with the department of consumer protection and trade due to false advertising.  When I bought it, it was advertised with a lifetime warranty.  The customer service of the company, especially Jim, are not helpful and don't even know their products.  I sent him pictures of mine, model numbers, receipts, etc, and he told me story after story but never fixed anything.  I was told the lock was a easy-to-fix $12 part.  Yet suddenly this part doesn't fit my hitch!  I was told the locks have a lifetime warranty -- well they don't.  I was told they would give me a great deal on a new model for my trouble -- then they told me Amazon has better prices than their "great deal".I will never buy a Trimax product again, not because the product fails and is of poor quality, but because of their terrible customer service!

For 6 volt batteries used in large farm tractors.  Inexpensive, yet accurate final stage readings on batteries that are supposedly fully charged.This charger has brought one large battery up to 100% and kept it maintained safely.  It's now working on another 95% charged battery that a manual  charger indicated it was fully charged. It is rewarding to know those expensive batteries won't get over-charged if left unattended over night.This pic was taken before daylight, after many hours on the charger.

Install was fairly simple on my 2011 Titan Pro-4X, took about 1 hour with basic hand tools.  A bit of a P.I.T.A to secure the shield to the holes in the wheel well, but nothing major.As for performance, definitely gives you some extra mid range power.  Can sound a little raspy at times.  Haven't seen much MPG change however... although I likely will once the exhaust/Bully Dog tuner are installed.

These work great!  They install easy. They fit right in. They work perfectly. They don't get hot. Your car will look like a spaceship with the 6000k color temperature. People who don't know about swapping lights out for LEDs that get in your car notice them immediately.In the picture provided, the top half are the ones from the factory and the bottom half are JDM ASTARs, 6000k color temp. They only work one way so if you install them, try turning them on before putting the covers back on. If one doesn't light up, take it out and flip it 180 degrees and it should work.

I got this for my husband. He loves it, as soon as i got it had to use it. He has put it on the back of his truck. It was very easy to apply and stuck really well. Make sure you clean the surface before hand though. It is a sticker and if the surface isn't clean it will jot stick. The colors go very well together. The black and grey American flag makes the blue stand out very well. I love love the layout of the design. I also like that it supports our police officers as well as the American people with the flag. I got this product for free in exchange for my honest review.

Looks like leather, feels like leather, smells like leather, but it is not leather. For this money it'a very good choice, but I would recomend to get the next size, not a straight fit. It took some hot water and some streching to put it on a 15 1/8 wheel, but unfortunately, some parts didn't want to stretch, so it looks funny where it didn't want to go all the way. But looks pretty good overall.

the metal contacts that hold the fuse are pushed in from the bottom, but the bottom has no cover. The connectors are visible. If this fuse holder is screwed onto metal or has a screw underneath it, you can have a big firework.Even if the installation is fine, over time, due to corrosion this could come loose and touch metal. If you have to change the fuse after 5 years of corroding then you might just push it through and it will touch metal. You then can just watch your car, truck, boat burn down. This thing is open to the enviroment like a barn and as safe as having a 5 year old with a box of matches sitting in the hay in that barn.This is not HELLA either, this is purely false advertising!the lid has a seal and suggests wartertighnes. but the entire rest is open like a sieve, water will get in from the bottom, corrode everything and then your installation BEFORE THE FUSE will touch bare metal and the fire starts.buy a fuseholder that has the bottom covered, not this dangerous piece here! one that has the bottom covered and this bottom cover extended to reach underneath the blade contacts that come out of it.

Great lightbar for the money and I love that can be setup in different ways, plus the different color lenses. The DRL is an excellent option (mainly why I went with this lightbar) i used to have the Rigid Radiance and this was way brighter. See picture (bottom one is the Auxbeam and the top one is the radiance)Only 4 starts because I didn't feel like it was 100% waterproof, I took it apart and silicone around the lenses to make sure nothing would get it in.

UPDATE,  I've had them on all summer.  Still working just fine.  Still love them!These are exactly what I was hoping they'd be.  They look JUST like the pictures (which is rare) They're super bright (see pictures I took on a sunny day)  They are one solid cast of light, very well diffused unlike some versions I've seen where you can still see the individual led's when up close.  Like other reviews said, they only take 5 minutes to install, 100% plug and play with built in resistors so you don't get any flicker issues or burn out bulb indicators on your dash.Unlike the description they have on these, the Brake lights and turn signals are the large outer rectangle, the parking lights that are on when you turn on your headlights are the 3 horizontal dashes.  Looks very clean, and I Love it!I've only had them on for 1 day, so I'll update this if any issues occur.Pictures of of my 2009 Sahara JKU

Just a set of stickers on a standard "made in china" frame.2.  Stickers may fade, or wash off or dry-up over time, we'll see.3.  Description should have stated these were stickers on the frame.4.  No metal flange at the bottom like the black one.

Quality seems good, the remote is heavy, buttons have a solid click.The included instructions are awful, and the receiver had two white wires for key 1 and 2. The instructions show white and yellow. I wired my 12v to my head unit 12v ACC, my head unit had an extra ground wire I used for this, and I wired each white to one of the 5v key lines.Programming it with my Pumpkin 5.1 Android head unit was a breeze and took all of 15 seconds. So far works greatThe only con I can really think of is that this can be universally mounted left or right side if the steering wheel if you want the wiring on the buttons to face up, note that since you can program the head unit to recognize it isn't a huge deal unless you are OCD like me. I'm going to try to fabricate a mount for my 2003 odyssey. So far I am very satisfied with this unitI am suprised that there are not more products in this category but for the low price i think this will fit the bill. I would buy it again if I needed another or recommend it to a friend

I purchased this handle for less than $8 here on Amazon.  I received it quickly.  This handle is very good quality and exceeded my expectations, it is made of a better and stronger plastic than the original (OEM).  I received a quote from Atlanta Toyota for replacement and labor for $287 (not including tax).  I decided that I would not spend that much $ on a 12 year old car.  After receiving the item, I bought three M6 X 12mm bolts (make sure they are not Screws/Allen wrench type) from True Value for about $1 then I went on YouTube and found a video and how to replace the item. It took me about 45 minutes being patient and taking my time.  My only advice is to watch the video twice and then make sure you tie thread or fishing string around the bolt heads so when you drop them you can fish them out easily.  (You will drop them, there is not a lot of working room and the area is very tight).  As you can see from my pictures, the handle comes in black, but the finish is shiny and smooth and goes good with the car.  No need to paint it unless you are self-conscious because of the difference in color.  It was a perfect fit and the only tools I needed were one flat screwdriver, one Phillips screwdriver, and a 10mm box wrench.  This was the perfect purchase. I highly recommend for a 2001 Toyota Camry.

Kahn's review is spot on.  Great winch at a very good price.  The only slight downside is the cheap mounting hardware for the control box.  I'm very pleased with the purchase and would buy it again.  Another big plus is that since it's waterproof there's no need to use a cover - just maintain the line with oil as recommended.

For the price, especially compared to full on rims, I'd say these are pretty good! They fit on my 2005 Scion xB no problem. Easy to install.I also spray painted the actual rims behind the covers to a black so they wouldn't show through so much behind the covers. Unless you look more closely, I'd say it looks like I got new rims on it! Not that I care THAT much, but it's nice to be able to up the look of my car without spending too much money. I mean, let's be real here: There are much better things to be spending lots of money on. Like food. Or rent. Or the Three Wolf Moon shirt.

This is an absolutely perfect upgrade for our camper's kitchen sink. Now I have more room between the faucet and the sink to rinse dishes better. The round crystal-look knobs are very attractive too. They turn very easily.  No more bumping the lever knobs when I'm using the sink. I purchased the chrome. It's plastic but it looks very authentically chrome. The faucet feels chrome and the water end is smooth and has a very nice look and feel to it. The faucet isn't too big and clunky like some I've seen. It rotates from side to side very easily. The water flow is good too. You'll love this faucet!

Easy install, and definitely brighter than the original bulbs. The biggest disappointment for me was that it was not noted or suggested that I would need a load resistor. I installed this on my 07 Ford Expedition. I had to go out and buy a set of resistors and ended up spending $15 more than I intended to. If it had been noted I wouldve ordered them through Amazon at the time of purchase and saved at least $10.

Put this on my 2010 Infiniti G37S. Great simple mod with plenty of safe clearance. I also placed a plastic zip tie around it for added security. The Fumoto clip/gaurd is a rip off off and SHOULD be included with the plug. Really, it is extremely stingy on their part.

Decent rotors for a decent price. Installed them on 2012 Nissan Quest and have no issues so far (20 miles later). Despite being MADE IN CHINA, they seem to be very well made (just like your iPhone). I can't find any imperfections. In fact, they look way better than EBC brakes I had before. Paint has a very thick coating and I don't expect to see any rust on the painted surface (EBC had a very thin layer of paint, therefore, black paint parts got covered in rust in no time).Braking is good, no vibrations, stops pretty quick. So far I'm pumped.

Still waiting for the snow to melt to try the windshield out but it sure looks great on my Victory Kingpin! I'm hoping this windshield reduces the amount of air flow into my face, my other windshield was right at eye level and the winds would make my glasses bounce all over my face. This one should force the air up over my head.

EXACTLY what I was looking for!! They sit high enough and out enough to give plenty of visibility to the rear. The OEM mirrors did not provide good visibility on my Tri Glide. While I went outside my trike's theme, I tied the mirrors in with another skull related product. The mirrors make the Trike look great!!

So far so good went together like a breeze. everything is as expected and explain before purchased description. This is a good item no matter what anyone else says.  just put it together, you can do it. Just takes a little mechanical skills because some modification may be needed as I did need to grind the mounting point out an eight of an inch wider to fit my wide frame on the bicycle. Plus i hade to go to lows and fine two longer bolts for front mount. But not much issues from that. Just make sure to get a daul break leaver.  Other than that everything else fit perfectly snug came out great. runs great starts good. I tighten the bolts for the third time already after riding over 35 miles on it already, trying to get it broken in. I am using 8 oz Oz of oil per gallon mix soon after that gallon is gone I will use 6 oz and after that gallon is gone I will use the 4oz of oil in gallon, of the best fule as directed in the instructions for proper break in.  I'm using Pennzoil synthetic two stroke engine oil for motorcycles / marine engines.After break in i may up grade some things on engine. But for now i love it. I am 250lbs and 5'11" and im getting good acceleration and Max speeds of up to 36 miles per hour using phone's GPS. Also using speedometer included with package it's off on kilometer but not too far off from miles per hour. Good enough for refrence the speed especially during setup may not last long though cuz of quality and the way it connects to wheel. In future if I need to see Steve I will just use my smartphone which will always be attached to my ride as I'm riding. Very happy it did include one cuz it made setup and visualizations of what's happening for acceleration during break in Period of this engine very happy customer and will buy again.I do recommend this kit. Seeutek kit works as said.

I got this item to help my brother-in-law install it on a 2005 Sienna LE. This item was purchased to replace a damaged cable on the passenger side sliding door. The dealer asked for $1500 to replace it, and that is way too much.With the help of a YouTube video, it took approximately 4 to 5 hours to remove old part/cable and install new part/cable. To removing the old part, you have to disassemble the door panel, the door molding, and remove the glass among other items to be removed. You have to keep track of the screws. There will be too many and mixing them up is inevitable. This was very involved work.If you are going to tackle this job, make sure you turn off the automatic operation of the sliding door by switching off the switch on the left of the driver side (it is the one with the orange tip. If you see the orange, it is ON. Pushing the switch in, and not seeming the orange marking on top, means switch is in the off position.)I would recommend watching this [...] (Many thanks to Teddy Hashee. Excellent job.). Before you attempt to install the item, you must watch the video to know what you are getting into.It worked great.I cannot say much on longevity of the item, since it has been only two days.Farid.

I read all the reviews plus seen a few cars shows doing headlights.  this product is great.  instructions are very clear and I couldn't be happier with the results.  just purchased a used suv for my daughter and the previous owner did a really bad job trying to clean up the lights. I do recommend you put extra masking tape around the areas you don't want to damage.  I sprayed on the protector finish afterwards, sold separately.  take your time and don't get freaked out when the leans are all frosty... just continue the process.

Easy to install, work fantastic! I put these on my 2009 F150 (amazon shows they do not fit) they fit and work well. Used Thermoquiet QC1012 for my rears, they have minor squeaks after 500 miles, even with new rotors. I expect the rears will take another 1000 miles for brake pads to fully break in. The fronts work fantastic; no noise at all. Would recommend and use again on other autos.

These lights do appear to be pretty bright.  They do however throw the light in a large area compared to regular lamps in the light I tested it on.  I have a spare set of fog lamps for my 2006 Dodge Charger so I used one of those to test the lights in.  While they are brighter then some of the others I've tried before, I'm not sure how they would actually work on the road.  I'll be testing that out once I get a chance to change the lights out that are on my car.  These do seem like they are well made and that they would last a while.  The light is white, and looks better then the stock light bulbs that are halogen.  In the pics the yellowish light is the halogen light, where as the white one is this LED.  You can see how the halogen one is actually pretty tight and the light is controlled.  Where as the white LED is all over the place, but it's still pretty bright.Over all they are pretty bright and seem to work well enough.I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. While my review might be an initial one, if something changes while using the product I will update my review. My reviews are my own opinion and are not influenced by anything but the item.

Tired of wondering where your torx bit is to remove the hardtop on a beautiful sunny day? These make it super easy to unscrew the six in the rear of the jeep with just a twist of the wrist. Plus after having the top on for extended periods of time, I hated to find some of the original style screws would come loose a bit and I would have to find the torx to tighten everything back up. Now I can check them and tighten them without much hassle. These screw right into the existing anchor bolts that are in the body making it all very convenient.

I just installed these onto a 2006 Honda ST1300. The grips are exactly what I wanted EXCEPT they are slightly shorter than stock grips, so I will probably end up modifying the bar ends by using my grinder to remove some metal from the inside part of the bar ends to make up for the extra space leftover by the shorter grips. On a side note, a previous reviewer is wrong saying that the grips won't fit properly. They indeed fit but very snugly so you will need to sand down the left side (removing any leftover glue) and then apply liquid hand soap and a bit of water on both sides of the handlebars while using a rubber mallet to tap the grips on. I also dipped the grips into very warm water for 1 minute but I can't say if that helped or not but the grips did go on just fine. It is also entirely possible to have the grips look like identical mirror images...it just takes proper planning. I would NOT use the included glue.

I think chemical guys sells a premium product. Most everything I have bought has worked or been a class above. But little details have soured my taste for there products. I bought this leather conditioner/cleaner knowing it wouldnt take that knew car smell away. The product shows up in barely usable bottle. See pics attached. Its works but for 15 dollars think you could receive intact and brand new bottle.  So very disappointed in not the product but the fit n finish. This is the thrid product I have received from and hasn't either been as expected or broken in some way.

Received and installation was easy on my 2006 F150. Truck immediately ran better! Don't forget to buy the gaskets. Thats the hardest part.  UPDATE: 500 miles and still working. I only had to replace one, decided to replace both. Glad I did replace both of them. Included in a pic are the 2 I took out.

So one of the other reviewers used this tape to make his bike look like a tron bike. I recently purchased an all black one with all black gear so I wanted a discrete way to make myself more visible. I purchased the black pinstriping and it's black during the day, white /Grey in the light. Incredibly easy to apply just wipe the surface with alcohol wipes first, it's been on the bike for over a month in Arizona heat and washed a few times and still sticks. But if you pull it off you can clean up the sticky with a Lil alcohol.

I give the lights a 5, but the mounts a 2. The lock washers provided weren't big enough to fit the provided screws. Also, when threading the screws two of the heads snapped off, so I was unable to get the light mounted as tightly as I would like. I will need to find new mounts and try again.

This is an amazing filler. I restore classic cars and paint full time so I have used this brand of filler for many years now. Its sands easy and does not stain top coats like other cheap fillers. If left to properly cure in between coats and after its primed over it has no sand scratches in your finished paint. You have to mix it properly though with hardener. Its ratio is 100 parts filler to 1 part hardener. Don't panic trying to measure this out, an easy rule of thumb is for every golf ball size of filler use a 1 inch band of hardener. Mix it right and let it cure and it will keep your car looking good for years!.

This product goes on easily.  I used a CG microfiber applicator.  It left a really nice shine and super smooth.  My car is white and this made it look even brighter. I used the EZ creme glaze first to get rid of swirls.  It does a great job at repelling water as seen in the photos. Lastly, the stuff smells great like most of the CG products (this is just a plus).

Perfect for my Ninja. It has powerful magnets and it honestly doesn't need the straps, but I use them anyway; I'd have no issue trusting this thing at 150mph without the strap. It doesn't fit many of the modern cell phone but WILL fit the iphone 5, 5s, 5c, and SE without a case (They're all the same size and shape).

Im too old to be wrestling with tires on the ground. The stand was easy to assemble and the adjustable height is nice. Ive seen the videos where people can change tires in minutes, on the ground with only 2 spoons. Yeah, thats not me. I changed the front tire on the ground with 3 spoons and it was a struggle. I tried to do the rear tire and I ended up pinching the tube! This stand made it so much easier and faster. I wish I would have bought it earlier. I highly recommend it. The only downside that I can see, is the rubber-like coating on the area where the wheel sits. It didn't tear on me, but I can see how it can happen. If it does happen, just wrap it with a tube and zip tie it on.

Rather the wrong item was sent, rather it couldn't fit, as exhaust pipe should be on a side, not in the center of the muffler. So lot of pipes welding required to fit properly. The picture in item description here shows the right version, but in fact you are getting a muffler with in/out pipes in the center.

What a great idea!  I hate having to put my handbag on the floor of my car. I usually put it on the passenger seat, but if there is someone sitting there then...to the floor it goes.  Blech.This is the handiest contraption ever.  You simply raise your headrest about 1/2" and clip this to the headrest's post.It is firm and secure.  My handbag is often heavy and this didn't make it tilt at all when it was on.  I gave one to my daughter who uses it in her car, too.  She loves it as her car doesn't have much floor space as her center console is wide and she often has passengers.Great value for something so useful!<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/IPELY-Universal-Car-Vehicle-Back-Seat-Headrest-Hanger-Holder-Hook-for-Bag-Purse-Cloth-Grocery-Black-Set-of-2/dp/B01FESXGSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">IPELY Universal Car Vehicle Back Seat Headrest Hanger Holder Hook for Bag Purse Cloth Grocery (Black -Set of 2)</a>If you found my review helpful, please click 'yes' below.

product fits and does its job.. the knobs seem cheap and poorly coated, scratch easy revealing bare aluminum... wish they had been powder coated or even made the knobs a little skinnier so they don't rub on my jack... love the look and everyone comments on them. I have mine mounted with the rugged ridge xhd snorkel and there is plenty of room to still open the hood as long as i have the base of the jack on the driver side and then the jack facing forwards.

Wheel Spinners (Suicide Knobs) are illegal on automobiles in most states (USA) but there's no regulations pertaining to riding lawn mower steering wheels. These knobs are a necessity for that application. It makes tight turns much easier and faster to make when mowing.Pros:* Easy to install. (I had to add more rubber to fit my thin riding mower steering wheel. It designed for full size automobile wheels.)* Spins freely.Cons:* None.

I love ZANheadgear masks. This one in particular, I use it on windy days when I'm riding my board. I have a big nose and this accommodated it well, thank god. This mask is both functional and fashionable in all the right ways. The mustache design is a winner and a personal favorite because I'm a man. A manly kind of man and this captured that just well.With that said, I've seduced scores of ladies with this mask alone.This mask neoprene mask is stud approved!

Second one of these I've done, although last time I used some cheaper ebay one. This is an EXCELLENT product however. Not 100% if it's real leather but it feels and even smells like real leather. It's very durable and the material is very high quality. Made my Nissan Frontier look great. I love these steering wheel covers. Would buy this one all over again and not any other brand.

These are a major improvement over standard VW headlights. I can finally see at night. I needed new headlights now, so I bought these locally.  The brighter the halogen light, the shorter the life. These are rated to last 450 hours so they should last 6 to 12 months. Shopping now for LED replacements which should last years.

Beware too short to lift my 19ft Minnie Winnie trailer. It would not raise the trailer tires high enough to remove a tire. I tried a 1" board under the ramp. The ramp simply slid along the board. The trailer tire never entered the ramp to put pressure on the ramp to stabilize it. I was able to change the tire by using the ramp without the board by slightly raising the back of the trailer using the stabilizer.I modified the ramp by installing a 1/2 inch heavy duty rubber material on the top section of the ramp securing it with screws. I will add a picture to show the ramp modified.

This is a basic, economy cover for motorhomes and doesn't really have much in terms of bells/whistles. The cover material is quite sturdy for the price, however, and I think this is a good value overall. I would probably give this product another "star" or two, except that the US distributor, Eevelle, claims that this cover is only intended for an RV "in storage," a very important fact not communicated in the Amazon description. (If I had a place to store my RV, I wouldn't have purchased the cover!)When I pointed out to the Eevelle rep that they also describe the cover as having a "rain finish for high water resistance," she replied that the water-resistant quality was intended to protect the fabric, not the RV underneath. Crazy!Lastly, I would agree with others that this cover runs quite large. I purchased this 20-23' cover for a 21' foot Class C on a Toyota chassis, and my rig is lost underneath all that extra fabric (see photo).

I purchased this bumper through another website but decided to leave a review here also. This bumper looks great and is built great, but it does rattle some while driving (I have a 16" rim on a 35" tire on it). Also you do have to drop the fuel tank to install all the bolts, but I just ignored that part and left it out as that is way to complicated. I installed all the other bolts I could and it has been great with no issues for the past 6 months. This bumper looks great with my Smittybilt Tube Fenders and Smittybilt Stinger on my 2004 Jeep Wrangler TJ Rubicon.

I've got two bikes that I alternate riding: a Harley Sportster for serious road work and a Suzuki GZ250 for around town rides. (Before you snort derisively at my "Suzi" I figure I could save $20-30 a month in those little one off errands that eat up gas mileage!)The Suzuki, which isn't fuel injected, tends to run cold at first and on occasion I've ground battery down into non-existence just trying to start it.  Sure you can jump-start it, but unless your going to run around in circles just to charge the battery up, you're just setting yourself up to be stranded somewhere else.The Battery Tender changes all that.  Since I spend most of my two-wheeled time on the Harley, the Suzi will sit for as long as two weeks.  By keeping the Battery Tender hooked up, maintaining a constant charging level, I'm always ready to roll.Easy to use, very safe, always reliable and reasonably priced.  A must have for the weekend warrior, whether it's your motorcycle or motorboat.

I have used this to spot polish some minor blemishes on my 9 month old car using just a cordless drill with some cheap 3" pads. And I must say,  it's works. Now, like I said, these are very minor scratches/marring on my car so I have no idea how aggressive it would be on moderate scratches. For what I've needed, this compound has delivered.

Was needing to replace tires on my 2001 Honda Accord.I only have 200 miles driven on them, but they're very good so far. No road noise, traction on dry pavement is great (tested with spirited driving on on, and off, ramps.For the money, you can't beat them..I was hesitant because I was unfamiliar with the name-brand, but for everyday a-to-b driving, these tires fit the bill perfectly.I will update this review in ~6 months, or unless something happens until then.Overall, I love this tire and am happy how low the price is.Edit: almost 10,000 miles later and a couple road trips under my belt with these tires and everything is still great.  I'll be buying these again for my car when the time comes.  I recommend these

Took 2 hours to fit it into my 1998 Honda Accord LX V6 Sedan. Doesn't exactly fit around the hose clamp where it connects to the throttle body, but I managed to tighten it enough. Other than that, everything was installed neatly. There was not a lot of wiggle room.The experience is awesome. I love the sound when it hits about 4000RPM. I haven't noticed any increase in fuel economy. That's probably my fault since I have been hitting the gas pedal harder now just to hear the roaring sound.Definitely recommended.

I purchased this control as a shot in the dark when my 27yo Atwood electric/LP suddenly stopped working.The new control was easy enough to install with all the old threads and parts matching up fine.  The only issue that I ran across was the new control had to be installed on a tilt on order to fit to the current gas plumbing.  (See pics).  After a few attempts (purging the lines I assume) the water heater fires every time.We just came home from a 4 day trip without issue.Hope this helps.

Even though its metal pipe some how they managed to at least deform the ends of  nearly every pipe in the box and the box had been opened and taped back shut, not sure why but seems fishy. The beat up ends made for longer install. Wouldve sent it back but didn't want to mess with it plus I was like a kid on Christmas and couldn't wait to put it on.

It's been washed, rained on (with a driving rain), snowed on, and put through high pressure car washes and there's not one bit of moisture inside, and every LED works. I'm not sure if it would have leaked if I hadn't sealed it myself or not, but either way, it took about 10 minutes and I'm glad I did it.The big question: does it whistle? Yep. It does. They all do. Just get a package of closed cell weather stripping from the hardware store and stick it in the 2nd from the top and 2nd from the bottom ribs, across the length of the housing and it shuts right up. Simple.The light output is amazing. I live way out in the country where there is no light pollution and when I turn this on, I can see way off to the sides and out in front of me. It really helps spot a swamp donkey (deer) that might be lurking in the ditch waiting to get creamed by a Jeep.Easy to install, easy to use, bright as heck and worth the effort. I made my own wiring harness, but you can buy them, too. You'll need something, as the light only comes with two 12" wires hanging off it. I've attached a simple wiring diagram.

Is a great product but requires two more washers on top of what is provided to space away from bumper. May even need a longer bolt. Unfortunately is damaging the corner of my new bumper so hopefully this helps everyone else before they install/buy.

Not exactly a direct replacement for the 168 bulb. The light output is good, better than incandescents and light looks to be 6000kelvin. But they were not a direct drop in fit for the 168 bulb. First off the plastic connector is not the same thickness and it sits a little loose. Had to bend out the pins a bit to create contact to actually light up. 2nd they are much longer than a standard 168 bulb so they barely fit and was not a direct replacement on my trucks license plate lights.

This muffler did way more than I thought it would. It is a baffled flow through design. I have been running a straight piped 4" exhaust on my 24v 5.9 Cummins Diesel. My exhaust is short and exits in front of the rear wheel under the passenger door. It used to be unbearably loud,  even at idle. With this new muffler it is now very quiet at idle and the rest of the range is deep and muffled. You can still tell it sounds like an aftermarket exhaust and it does still get loud if I get on it, but it doesn't have those harsh raspy tones anymore and it is way more muffled. Massive improvement for just slipping a muffler into the place of my blank test pipe.

I purchased these to replace the high beams in my Land Cruiser. After trying them out on a dark road, I was very disappointed. They're white, but not as strong as I thought a 100W lamp should be. The package they came sealed in said they were 100W. In fact, not that much brighter than the bulb they replaced. I'll keep them in there and see how long they last. I will not buy them again.

These Husky liners are great for my 2018 F150.  Watched the YouTube video before and it was helpful but not necessary.  Took them out of the box and left them in the sun for a couple hours.  Unsure if that was necessary but they were very pliable. Literally popped them in in less than five minutes per side. DS for drivers side, PS for passenger side.  All four screw holes on each side lined right up with zero issues.  No gaps in between the fender edge and liner. Made my truck looks a thousand times better.  I really don't understand why they don't come from the factory with them.The fella who wanted to complain about steel on aluminum for the mounting tabs is blowing it out of proportion in my opinion.  They are tiny tabs, which work fine.  They appear to be made out of galvanized steel or pot metal, either way there is paint in between and maybe in 100 years itll be an issue but Im not gonna be around that long.

This item is absolute junk.  If you have an old POS Harley, then it's fine.  However, this would never touch my bike.  First, there are holes punched throughout this rack, I assume for net hooks?  You don't punch holes and expose raw steel to the elements....it's called RUST!  Flash rust already developed around each hole and will surely develop heavy rust over time.  Secondly, the 4 mounting post have horrific plating.  The plating is not at all shiny with a mirror finish and there is deep corrosion....absolute JUNK!  Lastly, the welding looks like a first time amateur did this.Seller is being a bit difficult on the return and asking for photos.  Honestly, the seller doesn't know what he is selling if he needs photos to show he is selling JUNK and most people would not accept.  No matter, I've sent the seller photos and posted the same pics below.

I put this flowmaster muffler on my 93 firebird and it sounds amazing! For the price this is a great upgrade from the stock sound and it looks great to have duel exhaust. If I were to upgrade I would probably go with either an SLP or Borla exhaust though since they have a deeper and more throaty sound.http://youtu.be/Muk7SRUataUThe inlet size on the muffler is slightly too large for the v6 93 Firebird so you will have to get some extra pieces to make it fit correctly and I would recommend a good weld on top of that.

GREAT! I bought these bulbs (H11 12362 CVB2) to replace original OEM H11 12362 LL (Long Life)d. As you can see on the picture the difference in light temperature is significant (white vs. yellow, you wouldn't see at day light though). Don't expect same lifetime as OEM LL. Crystal Vision burns hotter and brighter therefore the lifetime is shorter. BUT, definitely to recommend! Quality product Made in Germany. Amazon same day delivery on Sunday was awesome and worth any penny ($10).

2004 Infinity fx35 Great wiring harness with fuse, switch and relay.  Wired 4 light fixtures to it and ran it to an auxiliary fuse that comes on with the key.  In this model, there were no day time driving lights.  Only fog lights and running light and both would only turn on with the head lights.  So I upgraded the lights to 2500/2600 lumens led and now have awesome driving lights.

Used only one coat of this after meguiar's gold class wash and really brought out the sparkle in the paint. I applied one section at a time and saw a difference the longer I let it sit on paint. When I waited the full 15 minutes before wiping, it was much better. I used nano sealant afterward and am satisfied with results.

Item not as advertised - Not SUSPA gas struts.When you look at the image associated with this listing you can clearly see it's a picture of genuine SUSPA gas struts.  However what they eventually send you, from China, is a cheap knock off.I could easily use the word "fraudulent" for this listing and seller.So far they work as a gas strut should, but I have no idea what the force is on these shocks.  If the force is too much then it can break the glass on my topper.Given the fact it took over a month to get to my door (would be nice if the listing didn't elude to the fact this is a US company - with no mention of "ships from China") it's not even worth the hassle of me trying to return these.I highly recommend searching out genuine parts if you want genuine parts.  These are not the struts you are looking for.

Meguiar's suggested that I use this when the DA power system didn't work.  I followed the instructions perfectly but it did not work.  If anything, the paint looks a little bit worse on the spots that I did.The first picture is a before picture.  The left panel was painted after an accident and the right panel is the factory paint job.  The second picture is after I used the M105, there is little to no difference.

Very nice quality seats, I'm really pleased with the seats. Over all was a breeze to install. However, I would like to point two things out. The first is not the sellers fault. These seats are large. I have very little head room in my car now because of them. I'm 6 foot 0 inches, so I'd say I'm the average night of a young adult. A major problem I have with these seats though that is the sellers fault is, the threaded holes to bolt the sliders into the chair are hidden. It took a while to figure out how to find them. The only way to get to the bolt holes, are to cut the leather to make a hole. The holes are under the seats leather wrap. Why they didn't pre make holes through the leather? I have no idea, but it was a real pain to have to slice open the seat to the holes. (Pain as in I just spent over $200 on the seats and another $150 on the brackets and here I am using a knife to cut it up.) Other than those two flaws, these seats are great. Comfortable to sit in, easy to install, and very fashionable.

First off let me say that I have always had loud trucks and this is in no way a negative review for the actual product.  I've had straight pipes & Flowmasters on F-150's and GMC Z71's for years and loved the sound they put out.  When I got my 2016 F-150 (5.0 V8) I wanted a little rumble.  I thought this would be a great addition to get some extra noise and up the horsepower by a few points.  Installation on this item is extremely easy.  K&N made it very quick to assemble and replace the stock intake.  I immediately noticed a huge difference in sound when getting on the throttle.  It was pretty cool at first, but it became annoying quickly.  I added a 50 series Flowmaster a few weeks later that made the exhaust sound good.  The intake gets loud and "clappy" on heavy acceleration.  I was getting looks from people in traffic like "what's wrong with your engine??"  I put the stock intake back on last week and happy I did.  I'm sure this would be a great addition for a 16 year old trying to impress his friends or a weekend Jeep Wrangler, but not for a married 37 year old with 2 kids.  I would recommend putting a flowmaster on if you need some extra rumble and avoid this product.

Very disappointed, i like the product, it was this or the spod. It works good. Seems like quality product. Installed last night. But the reason i put 2 stars. The switch panel has the dumbest mounting. It won't stay at all. Doesn't even shape to the panel. If you have a hard top, you lose a the closing part of it in the middle. That is why i put 2 stars, very disappointed in the switch pannel

These look great and add a nice finished look. I ordered them despite the mixed reviews an understand some of the frustrations with the installation. It takes some patience and work to get them completely in place and tucked into the fender but just be patient and it will all come together. To help, I had a wood door shim that I used to work the liner around the lip of the fender. I assume some people ordered the wrong liners for their style of fender flair so be careful of that! Bottom line they look great and will last for years. Took around 30 minuets to install.

I installed this outlet on my Vstrom right before a 10,000 mile trip this past June.  I was using the USB outlet to provide power for my Tomtom Rider GPS unit or sometimes to charge my iPhone 5S.  For charging an iPhone it works great. There are, however, three major issues:1.  This unit draws 0.5 volts from the charging system even when nothing is plugged into it and rubber stoppers are plugged in.  I have attached a picture with my multimeter demonstrating this.  This outlet is the reason my motorcycle would not have enough juice to start if I left it without starting it for more than a couple days...  0.5V is not enough to drain your battery overnight, but it will drain it eventually.2.  The unit slides around on my regular 7/8" bars even when using all of the provided shims.  I was only able to get it to somewhat stay in place by wrapping the mount in electrical tape to add some extra bulk to the shims.3.  The unit doesn't provide enough amperage to continuously power a TomTom GPS while it is running.  I needed to turn off the GPS unit regularly in order to allow the outlet build up enough power in the battery to power it for another couple hours.  If you are not riding more than an hour at a time, this won't be a problem, but this is definitely an issue for long-distance touring.

No instructions ...?  there are two sets of rubber seals ...its for two different rim hole sizes NOT one inside and out!!  Use lock-tight on the nut outside too !  other than that my wheels still have air so i suppose they work ? (so far)ADDED 3-19-16  . still holding fine, the washed rusted so fast !!  Would have paid more to have had stainless washers !!!  So here are a few photos for those wondering how far they protrude from the rim once installed.

Successfully put it on my new 2016 Mercedes GLA 250! I have no problems so far. I used it for my euro license plate and worked well with it too :) I had to make additional holes to  accommodate to euro license plate. You have to screw them properly and tight! And you definitely have to use a license plate frame to prevent your plate from bending. If you don't follow those you'll have problems. Nothing is wrong with mounting bracket. I hope that helps.

Needed to replace a squirting brake line due to rust on my 96 Buick Century, I have an expensive double flaring tool but it wouldn't do make-shift bubble flares very well so I ended up getting this due to the reviews even tho I was skeptical as the cheaper double flaring tools failed me every time.But to my amazement it made a perfect flare with ease on the first try! For the money this tool is well made and I would definitely recommend it!!!Mine came with two 4.75mm adapters, yet missing the 6mm, so I hope I'll never need a 6mm, but the 4.75 being most common and since you cannot get just the adapters I'm not complaining.For a nice looking flare I file the burr off the tube after cutting and reaming the inside, also I chamfer the edge slightly. A little extra step I take is put a drop of oil on the adapter.

This pan was installed on my 13 Ford Raptor 6.2L. It adds approximatley 7qts. I also added a larger trans cooler. I wanted to make sure my trans has long life. I am setting it up to tow a small 4500lb camper. I also like to hammer on it once in awhile. The pan hangs a couple of inches lower but is alot more beefy than stock. If you wheel your Raptor in rocky areas I would invest or make a skid plate to shield it from damage from a big hit.

Had this item since June 2016 and went to turn on the headlights last night and one of them was not working. I looked at the bulb and there was one of the LED's missing (only has 2). It looks like it just popped off. I don't know if it was bad soldering or just a defective part but this vehicle only gets driven once a month and mostly during the day. Also the warranty is unknown and the return policy is only 30 days. Hopefully this will get the manufacturer to read it and replace this part one day.

I installed the Doel-Fins on my 11.5 foot Avon SuperSport RIB (the S3.45 to be exact).  The Avon has an older 2-stroke Evinrude 30 hp motor and the Doel-Fins were easy to install without requiring a right-angle drill.  I spent a LOT of time measuring and determining placement before I drilled the holes in my cavitation plate, but once I drilled the holes, the rest of the install took maybe 10 minutes at most.The good stuff:The Doel-Fin definitely makes a big difference in two areas - getting up on plane and staying there at lower speeds.  In fact, I am now able to stay on plane at speeds as low as about 6-8 mph, which allows me to save fuel and create less of a wake while transiting through harbors.  Also, prior to installing the Doel-Fin, the boat had a pretty strong tendency to bang up and down when going into a head sea (swell coming toward the boat).  While I wouldn't say it was "porpoising", it was close.  After installing the Doel-Fin, the ride into a head sea is much smoother and tends to stay on plane much better when throttling down after cresting a swell.The not-so-good-stuff:Really, just two things - 1) Definitely reduced top speed.  Prior to the Doel-Fin the boat would do about 31 mph at WOT in a lightly choppy sea.  After the Doel-Fin, max speed at WOT seems to be about 27 or 28 mph.  This represents about a 10% reduction in top speed.  Not a big deal, since I don't really operate the boat at WOT much anyway.  2) The Doel-Fin really, really catches kelp!  It is very tricky to get in and around the kelp to fish or dive without snagging the Doel-Fin.  When this happens, the usually procedure of reversing the prop briefly doesn't always clear the snag.  I usually either have to do a quick reverse followed by a FULL THROTTLE forward push to BBBBRRRRREEEEAAAAKKKK through the kelp, followed by another quick reverse to clear the prop, or I have to shut down the motor and clear the foul by hand.  The problem with the latter approach is that if I have pulled anchor, I'll often drift right back into the kelp by the time I have it cleared, which repeats the problem cycle all over again.Bottom line, its a good addition to a small boat.  I found that the fins seemed a bit large for my small motor - I wish they made a smaller size that had less overlap of the cavitation plate.

These are pretty long so make sure there's plenty of space in the housing.I replaced my front and rear signal to this. They are bright. I had to removed them because the dealership told me these light were causing some "issue" with the fuse and void my warranty. I figure it's bs but to be safe I have to take them off because replacing them each time I take the car in for service would be a pain.It's a shame that my Crosstrek doesn't light LEDs bulb.

Seems to be of good quality. Didn't really measure it but its seems heavier then other filters I've used which might mean its it has more dense pleats. The only downside is that it came without any cover on the open side so dust and packaging (carton) particles could easily get inside the filter before the use.

The switchback feature on these turn signals do work. I'm giving it 2 stars because the lights are not all that bright. I compared them to my factory incandescent bulb and the factory was brighter. I bought these to replace a set of LEDs I messed up. The picture shows the difference, the light on the left PASSENGER side of the truck is brighter. These bulbs were installed on the right DRIVER side of the truck.  Not gonna tell you NOT to buy these,  just thought I'd show you what you are getting. Took these in the day under cloud cover, thought it might be nice you show real performance. At night lights look bright in the camera with glare and all. LEDs should be bright during daylight.  Again the light on the right are these and the light on the left are a different brand. These work fine just not what I expected.  Good product though! Not returning them, they will be spares or put in another vehicle

The cover is a decent cover for the price.  Snapped on easy and looks good.  It's plastic, but I knew that ahead of time.  It looks like chrome.  Don't know how long it will last, only time will tell.As far as the seller goes, they sent me am open box, returned item.  The blister wrap was cut open and then taped up with scotch tape.  Not real happy about paying for a new unopened item and receiving a already opened item, but it was cheap enough and looked fine, so didn't feel like returning it.

I'm a former autobody tech. To start off instructions were great. I installed these in my shop so everything imaginable as far as tools go, and anti rust applications. Took me 7 hours by myself. Never installed these or other fenders before. Follow the instructions and have a buddy help you'll do fine, just might take you a little longer. Excellent quality product and it looks OEM when done.

First impression. Upon opening the brown amazon box, I immediately noticed the nice packaging the spectre filter arrives in (see my pic). Box says filter is same type as the one used by the speedliner when setting the land speed record at ~330mph. Awesome advertising and looks the part of a high quality product.Pulling the filter out, it is definitely a very nice high quality product. Let me elaborate and compare. I just removed a banks (filter made by K&N) cold air intake because it was bulky and offered no improvement over stock IMHO. I've owned several K&N air filters including the E-0776 for this truck. I was looking for a E-0776 when I stumbled upon this spectre. After some research I discovered that spectre was started by a car enthusiast from his garage like many awesome American made products so I decided to give it a shot --- that and the incredible price point. It easily passes the look and feel test.Installation is a snap. Done in about 5 minutes start to finish. Again see my pics.Bottom line, you would not know the difference between this and the E-0776 if not otherwise informed. For the price of ~$30 vs $80 for the competitor this is the easy winner.

Product is a hard plastic ABS. Not sure how long it will last or how much weight it will actually hold. Installed on a 2017 F150. Unfortunately the bracket that installs over the Box Link would not fit with the tie down. I had to force it on and then drill out the holes as it did not align. (The tie down was wider than the bracket opening so it forced he sidesnoit aloghtly.) but I made it work. There was also a defect in the box (pic shown) and I had to bend the lower mount arm to get it straight. Wasn't going to deal with sending it back. Also, despite the instructions saying it cannot be mounted over a drop-in liner, I did it. (Pic shown)Install tip: if installing over your drop in liner, it will require you to drill holes. Drill the center hole first and insert the bolt and screw, then do the upper and lower. You will also need to trim the liner around the Box Link bracket.

These things look great!  You'll need to do pretty extensive wiring.  I bought a toggle switch to be able to manually control them from inside the car and put these on relays connected to the marker lights.  Very bright!  I can read road signs much better with the LED light spread.

Installed this in my 1999 Miata yesterday.  No drama, removed the fans from the old radiator and swapped over the Radiator cap. Direct drop in swap.  It's a relatively new cap or I'd replace it too.  It looks and fits like the OEM radiator.  Since it's a manual, I removed the elbow fittings to the automatic cooler. They came off relatively easily.  I just didn't want them sticking out.  The radiator came with the upper and lower rubber mounting bushings installed.  No need to swap those over.  While I was at it I replaced the thermostat, hoses and coolant of course.

I started this task on my S2000 at about 630am, finished it all by about 1030am. This included sanding, taping off with blue painters tape,brake cleaner, 3-4 coats of paint, 2 coats of VHT clear. I let it sit between coats about 20-30 minutes, light even coats. This is the end result, pretty happy so far, first time using VHT, as I used to use G2 caliper paint (with the brush), and I would say it's pretty good. Prep work is crucial as it is essential.I will update in the spring to see how they've held up here in Chicago.I recommend after letting the car sit over night (don't drive it after you put the wheels on once you're done painting other than to move it out of the garage or into a parking spot - drive for about 30-45 minutes and do some nice braking to heat up the calipers and let the paint cure fully.

Kind of bummed, putting the first light together and all worked out great. Second light, the little base was not machined correctly, the holes fo not go through, the threads only go into the holes about half of the screw. So can not mount this... Have to either send these back... Or machine a new base. Have no idea how bright these are, I'm sure this a fluke, but still.... QC was lacking this day.......

Purchased from Xenon Corp and installed in stock 2005 Acura TL late June.  Right side burned out 12/27/15.  Xenon offers 60 day warranty....  Though Xenon said all the bulbs they sell are "100% authentic and genuine brand products although they may not have security label" for peace of mind BE SURE to check your packages/bulbs for authenticity at the Philips site.  I"m not saying the ones I received from Xenon were fakes (it could have simply been a bad bulb), but I was unable to ck them do to the packaging (see pics) and am now somewhat skeptical as to their authenticity since the one burned out so quickly. The one bulb could simply have been bad or worst case fake.  The OEM Osrams lasted 10 years in the Acura, would have been happy with half that from these.To quote Philips - "Checking the authenticity (QR Code) 1. If you are on a mobile device, you can scan the QR code on the packaging, taking you straight to the Philips authenticity checker. 2. Find the security code on the bulb package. This number is unique to every xenon product, and has an iridescent rainbow shine to counteract illegal replications. For further security measures, the final digit of the code is repeated on the COA label, and can be seen when the box is tilted under a light. 3. Go to www.philips.com/original on your computer or handheld device. 4. Type in the label ID number and the security code. 5. If the code cannot be verified by Philips, it may be a counterfeit product."

I started with the Leather Nova Spray Cleaner. A pH balanced, no-rinse cleaner made of the highest grade, non-toxic polymers, and free from harsh detergents and chemicals. Made in the USA and even comes with a free microfiber towel to apply. It has a pleasant, leather-ey smell and isn't harsh on my hands, either. I know this because I have a habit of applying these types of cleaners with my bare hands. It quickly brought up all the little bits of dirt and grime on hubbys favorite chair, and wiped clean away with a towel. The surface felt smooth, clean and smelled fresh. So far, so good.I received the above product(s) free of charge from Leather Nova.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.

The side for the battery post works great. The bristle side crushed downward after cleaning one set of connectors, similar to what a wire brush looks like when it's been used for a really long time. I twisted the bristles in both directions and saw no difference. I took a wire brush and brushed the bristles back to their original position. Besides that, it's a pretty good product.Note: Don't turn the post cleaning side counterclockwise, it will not work and may break.

Update: It caught fire while plugged into the wall at my work and destroyed furniture and burned the wall, the only reason the building didn't catch fire is because we had fire extinguishers on hand. At the end of all of this I really just wanted my money back, that didn't happen. The company was upset that we disposed of the burnt scooter like it was my responsibility as the end user to store something that had already exploded. Very disappointed that I backed this project, I waited years after payment and the scooter was a total loss in within 6 months.Pre fire review:I was a backer of the crowdfunding campaign years ago. I have had my urb-e for about 6 months now and it's awesome. I fold it up and throw it in my small fiat, I unfold and go the last mile. I love it and get comments everywhere I go.

I like these cups and am going to get lots of use from them very soon. We had planned to already be started on some major house maintainance and painting, but the weather has been hindering us. These are going to come in handy once we are able ot start though. I received the Custom Shop Pack of 12 Mixing Cups at no cost to review and this is a pretty economical pack of cups.Until we can get our painting and outside work started, I have found these useful inside the house for mixing up my homemade cleaners and detergents. The cups arrived perfectly and I love that they are in a long bag that zips closed so it keeps them all together. They seem to be a good thickness and I can hold them pretty comfortably in one hand. So far, I am please wih the cups and the light duty tasks I have used them for. At roughly 87 cents a cup, they are a good bargain for what ever you need to use them for.

This is a fairly decent 3-4 star product IF it fits your vehicle. This is listed as the correct boot for my 1997 Mercury Villager in the Amazon catalog, the Dorman catalog and the RockAuto catalog. This is a direct application failure of the Dorman company. I worked 30+ years for Chevrolet as a technician, then as a Service Manager so I do know my way around a vehicle. I can only speak for 1993-1998 Mercury Villagers and Nissan Quests. This is an absolute non-fit.These boots are about 2-1/2" too long, which puts them tightly up against the stabilizer bar links. If installed as directed, just backing out of the driveway would have torn them right off. I had hoped I would be trimming off the first clamp step, which would have helped a small amount. But, no such luck, The first clamp step is the correct fit. There was no turning back as the boots were already half cemented and cured AND I didn't notice that the original boots were 2-1/2" shorter until they were cut off.I had to almost completely collapse these boots to get proper clearance away from the stabilizer links. In this tight state, they will not live long. Tight, slow turns will soon be their demise. I had to clamp them down quite aggressively to stop them from sliding back towards the stabilizer links. I included three photos to show was I was dealing with.Otherwise, improvements to this product would be to "gelatinize" the solvent. Super Glue did it years ago and it can also be done to this "solvent". The supplied solvent is thin as water and runs all over the place wasting about 50% of the product. What a mess!The instructions are lengthly but are lacking important information such as do you use the base adapter along with the wedge adapter? Do you use only one adapter or the other? My base adapters did not get cut open when they were made. It took a lot of digging for information before I felt comfortable cutting them open. Turned out they were not for my Villager anyway; frustrating. The instructions should be rethought and rewritten.One Tip: Don't try to pack these bearings after the boots are over the axle. They have to be packed first to be properly lubed. To protect the boots from grease, when putting them around the axle, use Glad or Saran cling wrap. Just take about a 1-1/2 foot strip of it, pull it straight and wrap it straight 1-1/2 to 2 times around from the hub to the axle. This will completely protect your boots from grease. After your solvent has cured, just slide the boots inward and grab the end of the saran wrap. Start unwrapping a few inches then pull slowly and it will slide right out.P.S. I don't feel that 1 hour is adequate for curing. I let mine sit overnight just to ensure a solid cure [and because I had the time {;-}Thank you so much for YOUR time.Syd

The light works, and brightness is okay, but the circles in the lights are going to bug the crap out of me. I spend a few hours building custom brackets for this thing so it would fit on my side-by-side and welded the brackets in place so Im not about to take all the crap back off. I recommend hooking your lights up and trying it out at night before spending the time permanently installing them just in case they're like mine. Really not happy with this and do not recommend. Ive included a picture to show you what Im seeing. The only reason Im leaving 2 stars is because it does actually turn on and work.

Impressed with the quality for the price.  Bought 4 of these in different sizes and colors.  Love each one.  The gloves are one size fits all, and really only fit 6-9 year olds, but my toddlers still like wearing them like mittens.  Love that these all came with matching goggles.  I've uploaded my 5 and 3 year olds wearing the different sizes of helmets.

Doesn't fit in a 2016 F-150. Too big to get the second door to open. This is different than my 2009 was it has 2 doors not 1. the funnel starts out the correct diameter but gets larger as it goes toward the top and by the time it gets to the second door it is too tight in the first door to go any further. the scratches on the tube 1 inch up from the end is where it gets stuck and won't go in far enough.

I was pleasantly surprised that the bug deflector extends wider than the hood and goes over the fender. The bug deflector is a perfect fit and looks bad a$$. It only took me about 30 seconds to install since the hood already had inserts installed. All the mounting hardware came with the deflector. When installing, make sure you barely tighten the mounting screws to get the shield centered. Once all the screws are installed, tighten all the screws, but, be careful not to over tighten. I was using a cordless drill, and, luckily, I didn't crack the shield. I used a crosstip screwdriver to finish tightening the screws so as not to crack the shield. Thanks for another great buy Amazon.

Well, I just put it on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler WITH the soft top on, and it was pretty tight, maybe it's meant to be used with the top down? Seems to be strong, duable material, however. I didn't quite understand the tie down straps in the back...where do they do? If they are meant to go around the brake lights, they don't stay put. I did manage to get one around the light on the license plate frame, but the straps on the rear right side literally have nowhere to go and hold the top down. Maybe I have weird rear brake light boxes, but they don't stick out very far and the strap just slides right off. The other straps seem to all have places to catch. I uploaded photos for you to see.I can't judge the tarp really, since vehicle models and configurations change all the time. Maybe the tarp was designed when rear-brake housings were larger and stuck out more? Mine are almost flush, so the straps don't work at all.

Great product for the money. I have no issues with keeping water out, but I can't yet speak about dust. But this accomplished exactly what I wanted, a place to store my gear out of the rain. It took me roughly 30 minutes to unpack and install the first time, but I couldn't imagine it taking more than 5 to get it back off if I wanted the entire bed uncovered. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to someone looking for a quick solution.

I researched the POR-15 products thoroughly before purchase.  I heard many users complain that the product did not adhere properly. I assumed these users did not properly prepare their material per the manufacturer's recommmendations.  I was wrong.  I realize that painting, and similar projects, are mostly prep work.  It should be 80% prep work and only 20% actually applying the paint/product.  However, even when properly prepped, this material does not adhere.  I put this over a painted automotive part for a lasting glossly look and for protection.  It seemed to go on just fine.  The product does "self-level" as per the description.  However, the product also began to peel off everywhere in less than 2 months.  It is to the point now that I will have to sand/peel off the remaining product, as the peeling clear coat looks horrible.  The paint underneath is just fine, and was completely cured and clean before applying this Glisten PC.  I have also used it on top of a bedliner material, to prevent dulling/fading of the bedliner.  Same result . . . peeled off in two months.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR ANY OTHER POR-15 PRODUCT . . . IT WILL PEEL OFF!!!!!

I did not drill holes into my vent lip instead I used stretch cords to make fast onto the roof. It is sturdy. There is a polymer screen which looks like it would stop mosquitoes and other small things from coming inside. The vent filter screen comes out with two screws.  So what I have  works fine for the rain. The vent open and closes fine. The white quality of light is still bright and useful coming through the vent when the hatch is open. There is about an inch lip along two of the side edges which has the openings for hardware that is comes along with. The vent cover does not sit flush on the roof if you put in the hardware or use the method I used which I just read is good news since condensation inside the cover will form and run down the inside cover and it needs to escape to prevent problems.

Works very good.  Bright display and the 7 colors are nice too. My factory gauge quit on my 1989 Dodge Ram so I installed this gauge.  Oil pressure runs about 65 PSI driving at highway speeds, about 25 PSI at idle.  It's nice to see a number vs a gauge with no numbers.  The gauge is very responsive to engine RPM as it should be.  Very satisfied.

I don't know if you can get a better deal. I put this light on my Jeep a month ago and it's worked real well. We put this on our search and rescue vehicles a few years ago and they haven't faulted once. No blown lights, no moisture and always come on. Turns night time into day time. Even if this light only lasted a few years, how can you go wrong for the money?

These seats are a great replacement for my 33 year old OE seats.  The material is denim, despite the appearance in the picture. The density of the cushion foam is very good and supportive.  Because it doesn't flex as much as the original broken down seats, they are indeed taller/thicker so you will sit up higher and you will be closer to the steering wheel.Getting the old hardware removed from the old seats took the most time and the new seats bolted right up to the driver slider and the passenger riser.  I would have given these seats 5 stars but for the following...1) The instructions are terrible.  Throw them away and figure out what you need to do. You will be better off.  They don't even tell you how to properly assemble the back to the bottom of the seat, leaving out a crucial step that is obvious ONCE you see it, but it should be documented.  The step is, the fabric connected underneath the seats needs to be disconnected and pulled back so you can get to 2 of the bolt holes.2) 1 of the seats arrived with some kinda dirt/stain on both the back and the bottom of the seat.  I haven't tried to clean it off yet, but they should not ship that way.Overall - I'm very pleased with the seats.  They fit well and bolted up to the old hardware easier than the OE seats did.

I literally exclaimed "Woah!" when I turned these on in my 2015 VW Jetta for the first time. Not only was the light whiter when seen from the outside, but sitting behind the wheel the light was just more evenly spread out and clearer. Definitely an upgrade on visibility, and the nice white hue is a styling plus especially for newer cars. In my photos, you'll see a comparison between all OEM then low beams with the Philips X-Treme Visions in, and I also changed the city lights, the tiny peanut ones next to the high beams, with SYLVANIA 2825 SilverStar High Performance Miniature Bulb, (Pack of 2). As you can see from the pics, these 2825 bulbs from Philips completed the new white light look, and made it slightly brighter. The X-Treme vision bulbs only have a 450h lifespan, so I wouldn't put them in any cars that use low beam as DRLS, like older Jettas from the MK5 series. But these will be extra useful in Chicago winters with little sunlight and lots of visibility problems with weather. Take a look at the pics below!

The 52 inch curved bar puts out a lot of light but the mounting options are not the best. There are two ways to mount the bar, one is right in the center of the side of the light and the other is towards the back on the side of the light. I had to use the one towards the back for my application. I put the bolts in with some locktite and tightened them down being careful not to strip out the aluminum threads. The first time I drive the bolts loosened and the bar pointed down at the ground so I tightened the bolts a little more and stripped out the threads. The bar puts too much torque on the back mounting holes.  If the cooling fins on the back side were cut away you could get a nut on the bolt and it would probably hold it fine. I feel it should have been a little better quality for the price, considering you can buy a 52 inch curved bar for as cheap as $100.

If you need items for your motorcycle check them out.I added a few more pictures size them up. And close up on the bike. The bike set out side cover up in the rain and snow because I was still working on the bike out side last year. The still look good... I'm very please with them. They are turn lights only not running lights I added extra running light behind my sissy bar.

This is real good for mounting diesel gages because it makes them real visable when towing. This is my second one . First one got real brittle and warped after about 8 years in our intense sun. But I liked it enough to buy another one.

I received these before I to get them but was just fine with me and packed OK But not Scratched or Damaged  just had to remove 4 screws on each speaker and lay the new Chrome covers over the speakers and screw the new chrome screws back in the holes  I had to use a very small screw driver cause I didn't have the right Torx.  Good Luck  Do buy 2 thumb's up again

Great idea but doesn't work for me..... I bought this for my trailer to carry around in case I ever got a flat several months ago.  Now,  months after I bought it and well after the return period The tred on one of my tires was off and it really needed to be replaced,  so instead of hauling the whole trailer in to replace one tire I decided to use this to remove the one tire.  Well..... I pulled it up on the ramp and it was still not high enough.... guess this is worthless for my needs.

Installed one on my Diesel generator to disconnect the battery from the generator to prevent the generator draining the battery. Drilled a hole in the cover of the generator and installed switch. The lighted keys are a nice touch. Does the job.

Ordered on Tuesday and they arrived on Friday. The fastest shipping ever. I wear a 10-12. Waist 34 and I ordered a 10 because of the elastic thigh and zipper in the back. Fit perfect!!! I highly recommend. I will have to cut a few inches on the bottom. I'll do that once I'm wearing my boots.The belt fit in the 2nd to last loop. I just had surgery so I'm sure it will fit even tighter once some of the swelling goes down. Love it!!?

I bought three of them over the past few years to screw into the back doors of my Sprinter van. They are very lightweight but yet sturdy. Great value unfortunately because they're made in China. No known way to get more than one lock keyed the same.

Just installed this on my 2005 z71 Silverado and I have to say I am honestly impressed with the quality. I wasn't expecting much for the price but everything seems to be equal quality with the kit offered from Spectre. Definitely feel the increase in low end torque. I paired this with the throttle body spacer from Volant and I have to say they are a great combo. Can't beat this for only $60, add the $40 throttle body spacer like I did and your set. Definitely will recommend this to others. Only took me about a half hour total for installation

Good pliers from Lisle! The rubber boot seems to be pretty thick so should last a pretty long time used appropriately. Nice to have in those hard to reach spots without ripping the boot of your spark plug wires by using regular pliers. Time will tell how these hold up, but have a feeling that they will do just fine.

I installed the Air Lift 60732 1000 series on my 2015 Toyota Sienna LE.  The installation went well.  If I were a little younger and not handicapped, it probably would have been a breeze.  I like the little lift they gave to my van with 25 psi in them, but after driving for approximately ten miles on some local pot hole roads, I decided to drop the pressure to ten for every day driving.  After I drop them to 10 psi the van was as if I had never installed them.  I did use the T for installation, because to I wanted a balanced ride.  I installed the bags with the line through the top of the coil springs,  because I didn't like the lines hanging from the bottom. I was concerned of the air line being damaged due the possibility of hitting an object in the road. I ran the air line through a 1/4 inch wire protective wrap just for extra protection for the air line.  I attached the cross over line to the break line which is over the rear axle with the provide zip ties.  I installed the air valve in the jack storage area where a mounting hole is already provided. In the bottom of the jack storage is a rubber grommet and I drilled a hole just big enough to force the air line through and sealed it with glue. I am handicapped with my right foot which makes me unable to walk any distance.  I purchased these for when my wife and I go somewhere that I will be required to walk, I can take my scooter and not have to worry about a sag in the rear of the van, the bottoming out and drag of the hitch. I have posted a few of pictures and I hope they help with your installation.  I will update later if I have any problems.

I bought this for my 2006 Sienna XLE and it fits and appears well crafted. The filter inside the box doesn't match the photo on the outside of the box and it's not very rigid-framed but in my case that's a good thing because replacing the air filter in the Sienna is a bit more difficult than in many other cars. There just isn't much room to work with unless I were to start taking other things apart which of course a person shouldn't have to do to change a measly air filter. The fact the filter isn't very rigid is good because it allows me to wiggle and bend it just enough to be able to install it.IMPORTANT NOTE!!: Given that only one of the four corners of the filter is squared off while the other three corners are rounded, the filter will only fit properly one way (in the case of the '06 Sienna, the squared-off corner should be at the driver side-front of the casing). Therefore there is no need for "top" or "front" markings because if you pay attention to the shape (particularly the one squared-off corner) of the car's filter box, the filter will only fit properly one way.

I waxed half of my car Saturday; a 2003 Toyota Celica that I recently bought and hadn't had a chance to wax yet.  This wax went on easy, and didn't need much elbow grease.  Just remember to avoid plastic and rubber, which seems to be about half of the car nowadays!  I could definitely tell which half I did. "Mirror Bright" is true. Especially yesterday, as my neighbor decided to mow his foot-high grass/dirt patch "lawn" and covered my car with grass clippings and dust.  So today after driving to/from work, the parts I waxed had hardly any grass clippings. I just dumped a few buckets of water on the car and toweled it off.  Great!  I just attached a photo after I waxed the entire car, and if you look at the hood, you can see the clouds in the sky!

Finish not so great but decent lugs for the price.UPDATE: after a few months of wet weather (no salt or harsh environment at all) these lugs are all rusty and look like crap. I will be replacing them with something different soon.Edit: 05102017 replaced the lugs with some Gorilla brand. These were streaking rust onto my nice wheels. Less than 9 months in service in a salt free environment

Extremely Bright 3056 3156 3057 3157 LED Bulbs Amber, Back Up Reverse Lights, Tail Lights, Black Metal Aluminum Dissipate Heat With Adjustable lens.  Upon opening the package that the LED lights came in, the bulbs were sealed in a protective static proof bag. The inside of the box also had foam in it to protect it from bumps and drops during shipping. They were in perfect condition.  There are a total of 72 LED chips in the bulb. There are a total of fifteen on each side, for a total of 60 LEDs. There are also twelve more on the end of the bulb. This gives perfect illumination in all directions. Also, the ones on the end have a projector lens to brighten them even more.  The video I uploaded was taken about noon and, even though it was cloudy, there was quite a bit of light outside. It really doesnt give the full effect of just how bright these bulbs really are. When I first plugged the bulb in, it didn't work. I pulled it out and turned the bulb the other direction and it worked amazingly well. I did the same with the other side. I got the same effect as before. Simply unplugging the bulb and turning it made the bulb work.  Since almost all U.S. cars have a 12VDC system, these bulbs have a polarity and will work in only one direction. Since this bulb is used for turn signal and running lights, they only work in one direction. Incandescent 3156 bulbs are also polarity sensitive. I have had a couple of other 12 volt LED bulbs that did the same thing. One final note, these lights were installed behind the red brake and running light lens. You will never know that these lights are amber. Some vehicles do have amber turn signals but my Dakota does not. I cant think of a single thing that I don't like about this bulb. It is super bright amber and was really easy to replace them in my vehicle. I only needed a Torx screw driver to do the job. I received these bulbs at a discount, or free, for my unbiased testing and review. I highly recommend these bulbs for replacement of your old incandescent tail lights.  Now I need to order more to for my other vehicles.

I found similar lights at a Jeep gathering and came home to find these on Amazon. Glad I did, I thought the ones at the show were a good price and these were 1/2 that. I really wanted them not for my Jeep but for my HD. I just finished installing them (with brackets 4x the cost of the lights) and they are perfection! Cheers!

BUT the plastic hookw are rather large.. so I cannot attach under fender w/o hitting the wheels on my compact honda rebel. I will end up taking the metal hooks off the old bungee and make this one funtional.

Pros:Light bars have a lot of lumens.  They seem to be pretty good quality LED lights.Wiring is pretty simple and of good quality.Look great on the truck!Cons:Hardware (fasteners, nuts/bolts) are a joke.  Instructions say size 13mm.  13mm is too small, 14mm is lose, even 9/16 doesn't fit.  The allen head set screws also interfere with tightening the nuts/bolts and are deformed when the nuts are tightened above them.  Maybe if the nuts were actually size 13mm the set screws wouldn't interfere.  If you try to tighten the set screws down further to be out of the way -- they will strip.  Not impressed at all.  For the price tag on these lights... come on.  You can do better.Adjusting the lights after installation is a huge pain!  Trying to get them adjusted just right is very difficult.  You need to pull the grill or at least tilt it down to access the fasteners, it is very difficult to get everything just right.  The adjustment is too imprecise.  Tilt the light bar down one tooth it's too low, up one and the light is pointed too high.  I ended up grinding washers to a wedge insert to micro adjust the lights.  Final note on adjustment, depending on how far you need to adjust it the light bar won't be centered vertical anymore and will need remounted. Luckily for me, they were low and I could add washers to raise the light to be centered.Conclusion:I'm not impressed at all with this kit.  You can find the light bars all over the place for less than $100 each.  So it basically $250 for two custom brackets.  I decided to go with this kit instead of fabricating my own to save time. But I've spent a lot of time fiddling with the fasteners and getting them adjusted just right.  It's hard to recommend this kit as is.I'd also recommend making one light a spot beam and the other flood pattern as a personal preference.

UPDATE 4-5-2011.I Called Smittybilt customer Service (Also procomp) and turns out when amazon.com shipped my unit it's possible the carrier dropped the box a certain way.  My clutch lever was loose and this is NOT normal.  They are sending me a replacement unit and gear cover to fix the issue for free.  So if you purchase this - make sure the lever is tight when shifted from freespool to engaged as mine was pretty loose and could move with a pinky.  B/c of the good customer service - i've changed to 5 starsEND UPDATEI just installed this on my cherokee XJ so this review will be specific to that installation.  I have an ARB Bull Bar on a 2001 XJ.  I attached a picture to the amazon for review.Packaging:This product comes shipped in a box.  the styrofoam must be cheap b/c some of it melted on the controller cable.  There appears to be no dents or dings and things came well.  The synthetic cable doesn't come on the drum and is in it's own plastic bag.  It does come with a pull line for the winch itself which is not pictured but is pictured in what i've posted.  It does come with all the hardware needed which is nice.Clocking:I had to clock the transmission on my winch so that the handle would point downwards.  I had to mount my winch with the bottom facing the the front of the car (you can see the bolt holes).  I also had to clock the motor side of it so the battery connections are easily accesible.  There are instructions on how to do both the clocking in the winch kit.Installation:  This unit weighs about 60 pounds and I was able to mount the winch with the bumper in place.  I had about 3/4" of room to spare.  I had a helper thread the screws in for me.  For the fairlead I had to drill two holes.  then i had to spacer the bottom mounts of the winch out with washers to get the nut to fit behind it.  The battery cable provided is long enough.  If i had to do it again i would consider move the solenoid to be underneath my hood.  then run the longer cables to the motor itself.  At current the solenoid sits on my radiator support.  I took the solenoid out of the plastic container.  The solenoid box is WAY too big, it should be made much smaller in my opinion.So far I've only used this on a test pull.  I pulled my jeep towards another rig as an anchor. I did it once as a double line and again as a single line.  It's decently fast for it's cost.  The synthetic line was what sold me on this in addition to the $50 rebate that is being offered.  The line itself is extremely light so that would help a lot since this is bolted on the very front end of my rig.Issues:I've found that the clutch handle does not stay engaged.  When a load is relieved, it goes into a middle area between free and engaged.  You need to apply some force to the handle to stay engaged.  I've rigged something up for now that hold it.  Will call their customer service and will go from there.  My other complaint is a smaller and a truely waterproof solenoid case.  These issues are what stop me from giving it 5 stars.

The mounting hardware that came with this was all plastic about the consistency of play dough.I had to replace it all with the following from Home Depot.SKU807011 #6 x 5/8" Wood screws452960 #6 1x1/2" Anchors (plastic anchors that have to be cut)380250 #6 Flat WashersThere's a video on youtube showing how easy it was (for them), but reality was quite different.I don't mind the extra $5 in parts, but am astonished that such poor quality stock parts were everexpected to work and the extra hour it took to go find parts. If you buy this item, go get theseparts before it arrives.  See the photo. The plastic screw stripped with minimal pressure (left)and the anchor deformed from inserting it in the hole (right). Note, I am not a gorilla.

Very different color (temp) from one light to the other... One blueish one yellowish (~6000k/4000k).... Very different amplitude response to varying voltage though at 13v both are fairly even in terms of output.  They look like they were manufactured differently in terms of time/location.

After shopping around and reading reviews I settled on this one, and it was a good choice.Incredible light,  mounts easily enough. I can see about 3/4s of a mile on the road at least. I took clear silicone and caulked all around the lens first thing, no moisture like others have spoke of. It has kind of a diamond shaped pattern of light, I think Ill try the full flood next time.

These lights put out a warm light that I would guess is around 2500 to 2000k. It's not quite amber but is noticably more yellow than traditional halogens.Here's the fun part. My fog lights were installed upside down so the vent tube was on top. My fog lights were on and hot when I went through a car wash and the units filled with water. Literally full. Somehow the bulbs not only didn't burn out but were still shinning through. I've since cleaned the fogs and still have those bulbs. I have no doubt the life has been shortened by the ordeal but this is a real testament to the quality of the glass used to make these. Most halogens would have cracked or ruptured completly but these still shine on. I will be buying more in the future.

The product I received did not say R1 on it.I believe it may be a manufacturing defect, but have included a picture of what I received which I believe may benefit others attempting to purchase this product.I received it pretty quickly (within a few days of ordering) which is nice, but the sole reason I bought this product is because it said R1 on it (and my old bar ends look pretty terrible).It's possible it has a symbol in a different language on it? I will include a picture and you can decide.Edit: They are also completely flat (and don't fit). I'm assuming this is the product of poor QA, but hopefully the seller can get this resolved. Many thanks!Edit 2: Seller sent me a replacement - I got the correct one, looks great! :)

This isn't starting off well.  I finally got my winch and bumper and when I unpacked the winch it only came with 3 bolts and some washers.  No other mounting or assembling hardware. Now I have to spend time un-sorting the issue.The issue has been resolved and the winch installed just fine. It's a GREAT piece of kit. I think the only thing left for me to do is to find an alternate location on my jeep for the control box.***EDIT***Update: I got to use it finally, and it is GREAT. Also,  I have since relocated the control box and got a cover for it.  I'm REALLY happy with this winch.

It works. I have a few boats that sat out for over a year uncovered.  The gelcoat was chalky and faded.  Decided to give this product a try.  The cleaner worked well (I diluted it 50/50 with water). The refinisher worked  well and brought back the shine.  **You will need to apply several coats to see desired results (6 in my case). A few helpful hints, use gloves, be patient and don't over apply, wet the applicator with water b4 and while using.Honestly there is no substitute for wet sanding then buffing then waxing ,,but it takes so much more time.  This product does a good job with much less effort..(see b4 and after pictures)

Problem with my 2015 RAM Crew Cab. They do not fit correctly. If you move the front tab outside the window channel and place it under the plastic mirror piece they will roll up all the way but the tab is exposed and it looks bad. If you leave the tab inside the window channel it will stop the window and cause it to reverse. I have seen were people have had to modify the visors.

Works great, the horn connector to the wheel has a male and a female connector which won't work with most wheels that require 2 female connectors. So be prepared to do some work if you want a functional horn.Added 2 pictures with a short NRG hub on a 04 Subaru STI and a long MOMO hub in a Corvette C5 Z06. Works great especially if you have a rollcage and race seats, it eases getting in and out of the car.

Mag 1 Low-Vis Synthetic ATF is a really good automatic transmission fluid. It meets Honda DW1 and Z1, Toyota WS, Dexron VI, SP-IV, Mercon LV and SP. It covers most if not all the low-viscosity synthetic ATF's in new American and Asian cars.A full synthetic ATF that is cheaper than most synthetic *blends* is simply unbeatable.Shifting is very smooth after using Mag 1.I recommend this to pretty much any automatic transmission. The only automatics where you can't use this product are some European cars, dual clutch, CVT's and old Ford automatics requiring Type F.I will definitely use this stuff again.

Great look and finish. For the price.you can't beat these. Fitment is a bit tight. Some of the switches don't rock smoothly as OEM beacuse of this but they still work. Ran into a couple issues after install. The starter switch was just slightly stuck after putting it back together and one the on off switch was flipped the bike immediately would start. Took me a while to figure out the button was being slightly depressed causing this. Was pulling my hair out trying to figure out why. The horn side did the same thing so I shaved the inner side of the housing to give more clearance and it fixed it. Other than that, I'm very happy with my purchase.

Works well, I have a Yamaha XT250 that weighs about 270.  The ramp appears steep at first, but i could easily push the bike up the ramp.  The tie down locations are okay, i used 5 rachets tie-downs.  2 in front, 2 in rear, and one attached to my chain hook on my reese hitch.  It feels decent, but I drive a Jeep Wrangler, and its a bouncy ride.  So far I am not all that confident yet, but it did well on a 5 mile back road trip. The anti-wobble system is okay. it works well enough for short trips, but i have an additional one I am going to use that looks like a u-bolt.  Found it on Amazon for $7 shipped. that in addition to the one that comes with this seems to be the best way to go. I also bought magnetic trailer lights since the bike tends to cover my brake/blinkers on the jeep.

Installed in a 2014 Charger SE. Took only a few hours to install. When trying to replace it, if you decide to uninstall the filter assembling that this screws into be awear that coolent runs through it also and can be under pressure and get into your oil. It's the lower one in the picture. This is during disassembly so the bad sensor is pictured. But they were basically identical.

So far so good.  I think they are well worth the $100 savings compared to wheathertech. The front mats fit perfect, the back mat edge does curl up by the doors which the manufacturer states will go down over time or you can use Velcro to help hold them down. I simply removed the carpet trim piece, trimmed the floor mat around the clips and pit the trim piece back on with the floor mat running underneath it. Worked great.

As a few have stated, this fits the LIMITED 4Runner with the JBL w/RDS factory head unit, and it fits perfectly. I'm very happy with the way it turned out. You simply take the brackets off the factory head unit and line them up on your new head unit. Slide the Metra unit into place...the black plastic brackets go over the factory metal brackets, "sandwiching" them between the Metra bracket and the head unit. Line up the holes and use the screws that came with your new head unit.

Comes with instructions and all the necessary screws (which probably also are supplied with your new head unit.  This unit is sturdy, installed easily, and looks like it came from the factory.  The plastic matches the car's dash, fits the radio head unit perfectly, and fits the dash opening without any gaps.

I put this on my tj as the stock one was bent badly. I could shake stock one back and forth with hand. This new one is very solid. Few months using it and couldn't be happier with it on my TJ Wrangler. Peace of mind when I'm wheeling. I upgraded to this after I bent my stock one (which is hollow and weak) and needed an alignment. I put this on as close as I could then got an alignment. Great choice for upgrade

Just installed these 5 inch black powder-coat running boards for new Ford F-150 XL Supercab. Took a little over 1h (after some prep work). The Supercab version comes with 2 brackets on each side to attach under the truck. I think the longer crew cab may have 3 on each side.  Install very easy, simple instructions and pics in the box. Seller also sent email with some youtube links to look up, which was nice - watch a couple youtube installs - good info there.  Here are my recommendations:1. Spray the brackets that attach to the truck down with some anti-rust clear coat from your local hardware store. Dry time < 1 hour and this little investment should extend the life of the bracket finish and prevent rust, especially if driving on wet/salted roads.2. Wax the  metal part of the boards before installing - just lie them down on some towels in garage to avoid scratching. I couldn't tell from the pics on Amazon but the top ribbed lining of the running boards are rubber.3. Definitely use the plastic square washers to protect your truck's finish in case brackets rust over time.... the bracket finish is not nearly as good as your new truck's finish.  Also, use anti-seize paste on the truck bolts to prevent rust/corrosion and ensure you can pull the nuts off without damaging bolts some years down the road when you replace these.3. You can go ahead and fully tighten down brackets to the underside of the truck, pushing the brackets all the way toward rear of vehicle. There is plenty of play and room to move the boards where you want them from the bolts on the boards themselves.4. Leave the bolts on the underside of the boards quite loose in order to position the boards where you want them before final tightening - this will prevent scratching the underside of the boards during final positioning.5. Consider positioning the boards as far out from the truck as possible - they don't stick out too far and this is good way to prevent some door dings from other vehicles in parking lots.  Sure your running boards will get hit, yet better those than your brand new truck's finish.6. Consider positioning the boards rear enough so you can use the rear corner of the step for getting up and reaching/tying things in the bed. I was looking at paying $600 - $800 for 2 bed steps (which granted, are quite nice) but with these iBoards positioned enough toward the rear, I can actually step on the rear corners to easily reach into the bed and get to the front tie hooks. Not as nice as a designated bed step, but hey, I saved over $600.See pictures of board positioning - you can push them back even further if desired... they'll slide all the way to the back tire.

I purchased this for a Solar Generator I built.  Wanted an inexpensive alternative the Blue Seas version, this fits the bill perfectly, less than half price. Its so simple to install, all I had to do was mark in the side of contractors box and drill two small mounting holes then bolt in place.  Currently I am only using 8 of the available 10 connections and has/is performing flawlessly.  Built this for boon docking and tent camping and general grid power outage situations.  It does not come with ATC/ATO fuses but those are cheap and also found on Amazon or any convenience store/gas station.  The fuse block is rated at 100amps which is more than I intend to draw.  While it is not water proof, that really was of no concern to me for where it was being installed.  I did build the Granddaddy of all Solar Generators I kind of over did this build, but I am so pleased I decided on this fuse block option.  I have included a few pics of this project.

Used this on my '14 Denali's stock 20's where they were becoming heavily oxidized. It took me about 45 min to do all 4 wheels and I am thoroughly impressed! Even where rusting from wheel weights had stained the metal, this quickly and effortlessly removed the stain!

I travel a great deal for my job. Most of it is OTR. Driving a car long distances requires, in these electronic times, a source of reliable and "safe" power for a variety of accessories. Whether it is simply charging your phone or utilizing several devices that improve the quality of your travel. I found myself in need of this exact product.The car I normally travel in I had hard wired and fused for two pieces of equipment and in addition to that I used its two factory cigarette lighter sockets for two other electronic devices. I switched cars for work and found myself with only one lighter socket in the new car.....I did a lot of research and, as I was not allowed to hard wire the new car, I found the BESTEK 3-Socket 200W 12V/24V DC unit. I checked the fuse allotted by the car manufacturer for the one lighter and it was sufficient to support the BESTEK and utilize it to the maximum of its capabilities. The BESTEK arrived and I was impressed with the packaging. It was professionally boxed with detailed instructions included. I was pleased with the apparent heavy gauge of the wiring. The extra length of wire from the car's cigarette lighter socket to the 3-Socket adapter is a very and useful feature. The head that plugs in is fused and the unit comes with an extra fuse. I like the voltage display. It reads accurate compared to the second meter that I also run. Please be aware of the units maximum current draw.Set up was fast and it worked from the start with no problems. I have over 500 miles on it now and that is running it most every mile. I am still working on a final mounting location. Right now I like the flexibility of being able to move as necessary. The quality is there. The price is competitive. The convenience is worth every penny paid. In addition to the product being so great I have had very positive communication with the seller.I am a consumer and have purchased this unit. I am not sponsored or in any way compensated by BESTEK. I am just a delighted customer who wanted to help others out. Hope this helps someone.

As some other reviews have stated, it's small. However, it's perfect. The whole point of this is to reduce the footprint in your pocket. I went from a big ol non climbing d-ring carabiner to this and I have to keep checking if I still have my keys. It fits perfectly. Not too tight on your pocket and doesn't give you any problems pulling your keys out. Do not listen to the review comparing it to a paper clip, they should have done their research. This is far from a paper clip. It is well built and sturdy. However, the actual key ring could be a bit bigger. I used a secondary one to attach it to my quick disconnect.I personally went with this one because I do not like the 'Keysmart' products. They are cheaply made and lack quality control. Also, the keysmart one is much bigger, almost twice the size, and they do not have a black one. It is very shiny. I do not like shiny clips hanging out of my pocket. It also has a bigger gap in the middle. The key ring on the Keysmart is a bit bigger, but that is an easy replacement. I chose the P-7 for all the reasons the keysmart does not have or tries to overcompensate for. I owned a Keysmart Holder and it broke in the first week. I do not recommend the keysmart brand.Stick with the p-7. It is easy to hide, well built and comes in matte black. I highly recommend this product, especially if you are like me and used to using a carabiner. I got so tired of those things getting caught up on my pockets. This design is perfect.

Excellent quality and just what I needed for my 12-piece Wiha Torx driver set: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LNH7GG/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1I love how the drivers simply snap into a centered slot within the plastic clips. Also, the foam padded magnet which runs the length of the anodized red organizer is extremely strong. You should have no worries about it sliding down or moving with the slightest nudge.As you can see from my attached photo, I attached this organizer onto my modular galvanized metal Wall Control pegboard. Me so happy, me love myself long time!

I bought and painted a new bed for my 1999 GMC Sierra 1500! I have never used a spray in liner before. Raptor makes a great product! It is super easy to spay and the gun included in this kit works great! I used cheap single stage low gloss black paint to tint from Omni line of ppg paint. I sprayed one coat on bed sides followed by a light second coat. The bottom I sprayed 2 coats. I had 1 bottle left over. I also did the top of my bed rails. Check out my photos! I do recommend covering everything because it does seem go airborne like normal urethane paint, but not nearly as severe. Wear a mask rated for the chemicals as well, it has a strong scent.Update: March 1stStill holding up great, I haul scrap metal in the bed all the time and it hasn't scratched through the coating. It does however leave a white scrap mark. I do also have a rubber bed matte on the floor of the bed. Check out newest photos.

Very nice upgrade. These parts fit perfectly and had no leaks. Before installing yours check to see if yours may leak. First, check the rubber seals that are attached to the old light bulb sockets for cracks and wear. Make sure they are in good shape then cover 2 of the holes on the light assembly and place your mouth over the third one and blow into it. No air should escape from the light housing. Don't use compressed air.  Water is 784X the density of air so this quick check should do the trick. But you will look stupid doing it.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ACDelco-LS94-GM-Original-Equipment-Natural-Colored-Multi-Purpose-Lamp-Socket-Kit/dp/B000C9S4RU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ACDelco LS94 GM Original Equipment Natural Colored Multi-Purpose Lamp Socket Kit</a>

Update 08/03/15:-----------------------I have redone the job however this time rather than going from underneath, I removed my motor blower and sprayed through there. It seems like the water coming out of the pan brownish but not as dark than the first batch however I then felt a difference in cooling in my car that I couldn't feel before and that's amazing.A tip is to keep the hose and push button and buy cheaper product for coils at your local store. It fits and you get a 20Oz bottle for half the price of what you are getting here. With the hose you can also spray through your vents if you like and clean them all.Enjoy!------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original review------------------------------------------------------------------------------I didn't know I could clean up my car evaporator this way. Not sure how efficient it is however I decided to give it a shot. The process is straightforward.Jack up the car, find the drain for the evaporator, shake the can, put the hose inside the drain as far as you can, press the trigger until can goes empty, remove the hose from the drain, put a pan under the car for later, jack down the car, wait 15 minutes, hop in the car and turn the AC on at low for 5-10 minutes.When done, check the results in the pan and discard appropriately.I was stunned by the result on my 2001 Honda Civic. Like you can see on the picture, what came out of the drain was pretty scary.I may redo the process in a few month to see how clean/dirty the result will be.For now I give the product 4 stars as I don't know how effective it is but it sure cleaned up something inside, yeah!

I didn't think I was going to like it, but I really like it. Install was super easy and took all of 5 minutes. It fits very snug and tightly on my 2015 Unlimited. I used the existing channel bar from my OEM soft top and it works perfectly.I cut the little side pull loops off because I didn't like them and I can easily put it on and off without them.
Running for my life!

They look great installed and are made very well. Sealed glass, not some cheesy plastic junk. The writing on the box states that they can be used with up to 130-watt bulbs in off-road applications. Likely could be an easy retrofit with an H4 HID kit here on Amazon. Very pleased with the results on my Samurai!12-24-13 Update: Lights still look great and have withstood ~8 months of abuse. I can't complain and would buy another set without a doubt!

I bought this to hold down a tarp over things already secured in the back of my shortbed F150 so the tarp wouldn't lift from the wind and my stuff wouldn't get wet while I was driving in the rain.Laying this net down flat on the floor without stretching it measured 59" x 78". Being made of a bungee cord material, it was able to stretch quite a bit but I didn't need it to since it's only a 6' bed. I packed the truck very securely so nothing moved around and strapped it all down. Then I tied the tarp down, and over that secured the net with the included plastic fasteners.The whole thing is tied together like an old style fisherman net. Some of the knots came untied and the cord ripped at some spots after only a couple of hours during my first (and only) use. That let the tarp flip and shred (see picture) after about 4 hours of driving, but the parts of the net that stayed tied worked fine.I've read the other reviews and most say it's great so maybe I just got a defective one, so I will return this one and order another to see - I'll try to remember and edit this after I test out the replacement (if they still let me edit it).Edit: Nope, a friend bought & used one just after this, and the same thing happened to his. In the future I will just use a few extra lengths of paracord and knot it into a net - less expensive, and longer lasting with a much better tensile strength.

Got this because my other one won't fit my car. Seems to be really nice quality and the grippyness (word I would use), when covered in oil is amazing. The swivel head really helps changing the oil on the Honda. Only, difference is mine that got delivered is black, unlike the one shown. I like the black camouflages how dirty it really is lol. Used this on two different cars last week Chrysler PT Cruiser and a Honda Accord. Plan to use it on a Lexus RX300 and Pontiac Grand Prix; I am sure it will come through with them also.

These headrest hooks fit well in our Mercury Mountaineer, the fitment would be similar for a Ford Explorer also. My wife needed a hook for her purse and my daughter needed an out of the way place in the back seat to hang her headphones. The hooks are pretty lightweight & do not feel very strong, so I wouldn't recommend hanging anything very heavy on them. For small/ lightweight items they should work fine. They look a bit weak to last real long term though, but I didn't really see any that looked much better. If I get a year out of them without breakage, I will be happy. The hooks do not move/ slip as much as I expected them to. I'm not sure why this type of thing isn't a standard feature in some cars. The hooks can be turned & used on both the front and back of the seat, which my wife likes because she likes her purse hanging in the front of the passenger seat. When there is a passenger, it can just be turned to the back.

Bought this for my 29 foot Class A Motor Home. The company could not have made this any easier to work. It's seriously girl proof simple and it does a great job. It's  not heavy and so compact. The tote bag it comes in is fantastic and small. Fits right in my RV outside basement area. Every RV owner should carry this. It makes life on the road so much simple verses having to drive around looking for a gas station's air pump that will accomidate your rig. One of the best purchases I've bough.

whether you have street tires or super aggresive MT's this thing is gold. Ive tried everything from foam wheel pads (MT side treads tear foam apart after just 2 tires,) microfiber applicators and towels (takes FOREVER and lose a lot of product,) and even a paint bush. If you use a quality shine that is a cream or gel this is the product to have. Its much bigger then i thought it would be which is awesome and the bristles are nice and firm giving you more precise control of applying. It also cleans off very easy and does not absorb the shine you use causing you to have to use a ton. Its really just a great product

Completes the missing bright pedal in my 14' Challenger. Works great. Added pictures of the rubber pedal it replaces. The back of the stainless pedal, is the same as the rubber one it replaces. The reviews about it not fitting are wrong. The back of this pedal is the same hard rubber material as the old one, so its kind of a pain to get it to fit. It just takes some muscle, a screw driver, and a few curse words, to wrap the pedal around all 4 corners of the metal emergency brake.  Again, pictures are of the rubber pedal that the stainless replaces. The back of the pedal looks the same.

This is a very nice winch. I just installed it on my 2016 Teryx 4, so I haven't had to use it yet. The instructions could have been a little better and in more detail. If you have any technical skill you can figure it out though. I used the MotoAlliance winch mounting plate for my UTV and everything fit perfectly.  This winch come with a control module.  I mounted underneath the hood to the left of the airbox.  I wasn't sure where  else to put it.  I have yet to mount the plug for the remote.  I am still trying to determine where that should go.  I am leaning towards the right side of the airbox.  I do not want it exposed to where you can see it.  I'll post pictures if and when I get that installed.

They seem fairly cheaply made, but good enough for their price. The mirrors aren't totally smooth,so the reflection is a little orange-peelish, but they provide a huge field of view. I can even see my rear tire now.The hardest part about installing these is getting my bar ends off the bars.I had to modify them so that they can flip in to allow me to lane split. It was an easy modification, you just need a bench vice and a file.Pictures below show detail on how to make this modification.

I must admit I wasn't totally excited to get these for my truck, seeing as I've had my truck for 5 years already and just finally got them. When they arrived I was pleasantly surprised with how they look! These are very stout, and I like the oval bars way more than all of the round ones that I seem to see more of. The fit and finish are spot on, and they are solid! I will agree that the instructions are pretty lame, but if you can't figure out how to install these without the instructions, maybe you shouldn't be working on your truck in the first place.... Only time will tell how these hold up to the elements, but I am very impressed with them so far. I got black

Well the grill insert works great and the fit and finish is superbSo for this winter no issues with all the salt and grunge we have here, all okayThe side inserts have some mounting desired for how it fastens into the factory grill.I'm not so worried I actually left them out and painted the factory to flat blackDon't be scared by price, this product is a winner

I used this to hook up two LED light bars behind the grille of my F150.  The weatherproof terminals/connectors that come on the light legs are a really nice touch for quick disconnecting lights if you need it. The corresponding terminals come with the harness to put on whatever you are powering so that it plugs in to the harness.  I hooked the blue wire of the switch to my high beam power wire so that my light bars come on when I turn on my high beams.

aside from the price which is a tab bit high, this product securely kept my hi lift 48" jack to my bumper even through the roughest trails. if theft of your jack is a problem, either secure it with a bike lock or hi lift sells a lockable clamp to go along with the TM-700. All in all I am happy with the design and build quality so far. I live in the tropics and it has survived about 5 months in extreme heat and extreme thunderstorms

Went on easy, but had to do some custom modifications to fit on with the handguards. Just had to drill a bigger hole to fit the long screw and had to shave the piece that holds everything on inside the handle bar. The only thing I don't like is I have to stretch my hand to start the bike since it is further away. Otherwise I would recommend it.

This cover has a great fit for my full dress goldwing. It fully covers the entire bike and the straps are to the rear and front. I was able to strap through each rim and it is secure and in place. Love the cover!

I got this to tow my ural sidecar motorcycle after reading all the mixed reviews. Knowing that I needed heavy duty straps, I got rid of the crap ones that came with the hitch and use airplane cargo tie downs. It handles my dry 795lb bike even packed with gear and extra fuel at over 800lb rated.  I don't have to worry about the bike tipping over at all be that I have 3 wheels. It handles like a normal trailer when backing up also. Am very happy with this product for my intended use.

Bought this one by accident, wanted one to fit a group 24 battery - ONLY, but the extra space inside comes in handy.  Not shown in the pictures, or mentioned in the description, is a plastic divider wall that fits in one of several slots according to your battery's actual size.  This keeps a smaller battery (smaller than a group 31) from moving around inside the box.  In the empty space I keep extra oil, spark plugs & socket, shear pins, grease rags, universal screwdriver, pliers and emergency starter rope, all in a plastic bag.The only negatives might be that the overall construction feels a little thin, however it is plenty strong enough.  Also, the locking tabs can be stubborn to release without the aid of a small flat tip screwdriver or knife blade, but they are added insurance in case the provided strap comes lose or is accidentally left off, (better than losing your battery case top going down the highway - there's already enough life preservers, bungee cords, sandals, clothing, water toys and motor cowls out there now).  If the locking tabs really bugged you, they can be easily cut off.I would probably buy again for the price and the extra storage space it provides when using a smaller battery.

I bought the this for my 2008 Tacoma (desert sand mica) to fix several spots on the hood that had been chipped and started to corrode. The color matched ok, I suspect that the environment has made my paint slightly lighter versus the paint color in the pen. Overall, it is a good product, all-in-one as stated. It has a tip that is used to clean the area and works pretty good. I uploaded some photos of the completed job. It is definitely noticeable (I had some pretty big chips). But I didn't wet sand or anything like that. I pretty much just wanted to fix the problem of corrosion and have the some color paint. If you are not to pick, this product is great.

I really like the mirrors, however, the lack of installation instructions was disappointing. One of the Amazon reviewers did provide instructions in his review, and I followed those. I'm handy and would have been able to get the mirrors installed without them, but for less mechanically inclined people, the one cent added cost to provide instructions will be greatly offset by having less frustrated customers. Overall, unbeatable fit and finish for the money. Looks amazing on my 2001 SV650N.

I usually buy bilstein but thought I would give this a try, now wishing I didn't. can't be sure but I'm wondering if I got a used or refurbished shock. The shock itself looks a little beat up, the boot doesn't look used but came torn, the description said the boot was black and the shock was silver, so does the box, but it's white and red. I'm debating even installing this thing, but I'm thinking it's got to be better than my blown one. Well see. I may return it, I certainly won't be buying it again. Bilstein for me.

I couldn't see spending an extra $200 for the Terraflex mount and hinge, so I got this and the savings was essentially a free spare tire.  I went with the Xprite brake light that mounts inside the spare. I'm in a 2016 JKU with 35" tires and 16" Cepek DC2 wheels.  Each wheel tire weighs about 115lbs.For those complaining about the thumping, you have to take care when you install the hinge.  There are three tightening phases I used.  The initial when you wedge and first attach.  The second when you swing it to the open position (maybe 20 degrees), lift wedge and tighten it again.  And the third when  you install the spare and lift wedge AGAIN.  That should get it flush and tight.So far I haven't had any issues.  I've had mine for only a week, but what I did was test on a parking lot curbs and speed bumps at different speeds and angles to test the twist with drops/climbs, and straight on with hard drops/climbs.Height adjustment would be niceI'll report back in a few months to give an update.So far, I think this is a GREAT HD mount and hinge kit with an easy install.

It does what is supposed to do, it shuts of the Active Fuel Management on my 2007 Chevy Avalanche and no more burning oil. This is a pretty common issue on 2007 chevy 5.3 liter with AFM. Also fuel MPG didn't change at all in traffic, highway I got 20 Miles per gallon so no change there as well. If you notice your truck is going low on oil and you have a 5.3 liter with AFM try this Gadget.I give a thumbs up !

I have been having a soft pulse in the brake petal of or 2014 Toyota Sienna. It is the tell tale sign of warped rotors. It pulse was fairly soft, and may have been able to be turned out on a rotor lathe. But I prefer the safety of new brand name rotors, when my family is concerned. For just $10 more per rotor, to get a premium product, I figure it is a no brain-er.If you complete all the steps the first time, changing out the rotors is a quick easy process. You will need a 21 mm lug wrench for the wheels. I bought this one&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Titan-Tools-21093-21mm-1-2-quot-Drive-Non-Marring-Deep-Lug-Nut-Socket/dp/B008XMDSJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Titan Tools 21093 21mm 1/2" Drive Non-Marring Deep Lug Nut Socket</a>. It fits my 3 foot breaker bar perfectly, and I can get any lug off any wheel with zero issues.You will need a 17 mm socket, and a 14 mm socket. The 14 mm socket takes the bolt out of the outer caliper, and the 17 takes the bolts out of the caliper body. You may also need a vise grip or other wrench to hold the caliper pins while you take the 14 mm bolts out.If you remember to replace all the clips the first time, you can do one side in 15 to 20 minutes, depending on how quickly you work. There are lots of great demo videos on youtube. But this is definitely a DIY project. I found that I could depress the pistons with a scrap board. I am sort of a beast, so YMMV. But a C clamp or other compression tool will be a suitable sub for a caliper tool.After reassembly, I took a nice 10 mile ride. The brakes have never been mroe smooth or responsive. Amazon was out of Bosch pads for my vehicle, so I opted for Akebono,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Akebono-ACT1324-ProACT-Ultra-Premium-Ceramic-Brake-Pad-Set/dp/B003E26EV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Akebono ACT1324 ProACT Ultra-Premium Ceramic Brake Pad Set</a>. They may prove to be the better option anyway, as they are reviewed to be lower dust. My original Toyota pads are dust monsters, so any improvement is greatly appreciated.If you are on the fence about doing this job, and you have the tools mentioned above, what are you waiting for. This is the most important safety feature on your car, and with Youtube's help, you can do this!

Lets first agree that we all have found our go-to chemicals depending on our level of laziness/dedication/skill and money to spend on car care.That being said: I have been a fan of the ultima paint sealant for about 2 years now. I have no time or conditions to do nowhere near as much as I like to do to my cars. I have a young son who takes all the time I have and then some:) and most of the available resources. For that reason, ultima is the easiest and fastest car selant I found to apply two/three times a year and have at least some paint protection.Because of the ease of use and the great results acheived with the sealant I decided to try the waterless wash. Not surprisingly, the wash works great. I use it abit more concentrated than the sticker on the bottle says and it does work great. It dissolves the road grime and dust, affords immence lubricity and is perfect to use in the garage in the winter. Two 650ml spray bottles of diluted concentrate and bunch of microfiber towels equal a great looking clean BMW sedan in about 30 minutes.Considering that the temps outside are such that my water pipes froze - I can actually keep my car clean using my unheated attached garage to wash the vehicle!The car looks and feels clean and smooth and the wash compliments the Ultima sealant I applied 4 months ago.As I said above-Umtimately Impressed.

I installed this product with some help from a friends workshop and my wife, bought this product as we were planning to move and haul our luggage.Issue: The night of the move as I tried to install the cargo rack with the adaptor, I got to know at 1 in the night that the square pipe had a fault which was blocking the adaptor to be inserted completely. Although I did manage to modify the adaptor by drilling and filing for 2 hours, that delay cost me ample of time on my trip from Tempe, Arizona to Sacramento, California. I have taken pictures of the fault and it seems like the manufacturer knew about it and hid it with one of their stickers. The other picture is of the adaptor I had to modify to be able to insert it in.

Purchased this to replace an extang full-tilt tonneau that was destroyed when my truck was towed. I am a home inspector by trade and carry lots of stuff in the bed of my truck, so protection from the elements and functionality are important. Initially I was skeptical about this cover, but once it arrived and I installed it I feel better about it. The build quality feels sturdy and well made with quality materials. The installation couldn't have been easier on my 2006 GMC Sierra, taking only about 15 minutes. Included with the cover are a storage bag to protect the cover when you take it off, and an LED bed light, which feels a little cheap and gimmicky but whatever. Time will be the ultimate judge of how well this cover holds up, but given the apparent build quality I don't think itll have any problems.

My expectations may of been too high. Let me start off with saying that this awning does everything an awning should do. It is "easy" to set up, it blocks the sun and the rain. I did how ever have a few issues, if you consider them issues.First of all, no where does it say that a universal mounting kit comes with the awning. So I went out and bought stuff to mount it only to find out I didn't need them. Right when i opened the box it came in, I was a little surprised to see how slender the awning was. To some this may sound good, but the engineer in me thinks about everting else being smaller, like the material, aluminum and the bolts. So when I mounted the awning and rolled it out for the first time. I was a little disappointed in the thickness of the cloth. I was expecting a Sunbrella like material that the ARB and Foxwing awnings have. This is much thinner. About as thick as a nice heavy flannel shirt but that is waterproofed. My next issue was with the horizonal pins that attach to the vertical legs. The holes were not drilled out big enough for the pins to install, then I drilled them out a little and noticed that the pins do not go all the way through the arms. This creates an awkward torque on the pin that I was not comfortable with. SO I drilled them out all the way and I am MUCH more comfortable with the stress on those pins.All said and done it is a nice awning for the price. I mean, you get what you pay for. Its no 100$ awning but its no 400$ awing ether. Im curious to see how long it last. Im expecting a few years of light to moderate use before the material breaks down in the South Carolina sun here.

I purchased this kit on Amazon after deciding it was the most cost effective option.  I didn't want to get stuck spending a lot on a kit that didn't end up working.  Fortunately, it seems my fears were not well placed, this kit worked out beautifully.The kit includes:-2x replacement bulbs (and all the wires, connectors, etc. you should need)-2x ballasts (to power the HID bulbs)-2x mounting brackets (to secure the ballasts-miscellaneous mounting accessories (zip ties, double-sided tape, etc.)The kit was surprisingly well thought out - unlike the manual (it sounds like it was written overseas).  I pulled out the all the parts and couldn't figure out why there needed to be as much wire in the kit as there was, but it all fit together brilliantly.  The only troubling part is in some cars you will have to figure out where you're going to mount the ballast.  The ballast is a necessary part of these bulbs, as it's what ramps up the voltage to power HID bulbs - and it's slightly larger than a pack of playing cards.  So you'll need to make sure there's a surface you can mount to somewhere near your headlight.  As long as you're not afraid to get your fingers dirty, you should be able to install these in short order.  If not, there's always the professional installation option.Otherwise, I'm very satisfied by the significantly increased light output and enhanced night vision I now enjoy.  Don't hesitate to buy!Pros:-Much brighter than original bulbs (~3x)-Well thought out components (weather-proof connectors)-Decent instruction manual-Simple enough to install yourselfCons:-Not quite as straight forward as a typical bulb replacement (but not much more involved)-Instruction manual can be vague at times-Ballast is large enough to pose mounting concerns (you may have to be creative)

Now you tell me where can you find 20 Led in blue for under $10? With that said I've replaced all the old original bulbs that really didn't light up my gauges and instrument panel in my 1991 jeep wrangler yj.  Now I have a bright blue led the lights up my dash very nicely and bright. So what can I say if you want to spend more money on high end led bulbs go ahead but for me this did the job and more. Also delivery was on time as always.  Thanks Amazon

First off, the leather quality is pretty good for $10. It is most probably actual leather or very good quality faux leather. I can't be there. What I do know is that it is very strong. I pulled the strings pretty tightly and none of the holes tore apart. The stitching is a solid 1.5 to 2 hours job and you do get sore fingers pulling the needle out while sewing. At the end, you do get a very satisfying feeling. It's worth it. The leather provides significantly better grip as compared to stock steering wheel. There are 2 needles and 2 bundles of string. I needed only 1 bundle. They do provide extra needle and string if needed, free of cost.

We installed these in our 2014 Ford F150 pick up and what a difference these bulbs make! Holy smokes! The light from these bulbs are MUCH brighter and whiter. The original bulbs had a yellow tinge to it. It took my husband a little time to get them in there. Once he figured it out, they fit nicely and because the cover is not textured, you can clearly see the led bulbs if you look up at the light (which I don't recommend doing). These suckers are BRIGHT! You have been warned.There was one bulb that didn't work out of the package but as another reviewer mentioned, it could be a misaligned wire so we're going to give it another look. The packaging is frustration free and can be used repeatedly so you don't lose any bulbs.We changed the bulbs out in my 2008 Sienna. This fit in all lights in the cabin EXCEPT the two front doors and the trunk. Those use the cylinder bulbs. It made my van look like high noon at night. Pic attached. You can clearly see which one wasn't changed and this was taken at night . The inside of my van is so bright!I'm very pleased with this product.I was provided a free sample for my honest review.

See the install pics on the Black 7603B comments...7602B Look awesome in Black, but somethings rotten in denmark....For one of the most popular trucks in America, Jeep grand Cherokee, I wanted a seamless look. Still waiting on response from THULE. In comparison to the fitted feet shown on the rubber feet "mushroom" out in "FITkit 3142" required for my 2014 JEEP WK with factory rails, for $500+ I expect a SWISS watch, not a Swedish fish. IDK what feet were used in the link, (Black Jeep) but they are not provided in the 3142 FitKit. Check the link /pic. http://www.rackoutfitters.com/jeep-grand-cherokee-thule-black-aeroblade-edge-roof-rack-11-15/IMHO, the FitKit is a POS for $100, it is not a neat seamless look.I soooo regret not going with the USA made, Yakima Whispbar, but the MOPAR racks are THULE. THose look like extension ladders are going to be hauled though. Check out the video "Installation of a Whispbar Flush Bar Roof Rack on a 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee" its custom fitted for the JEEP WK, minimal fussy moving parts, only doesn't come in all Black, but probably worth the powder coating due to less cost about $460, and LESS aggravation.Update: I asked THULE and they played dumb in the response, saying the "mushrooming" was where the bracket bolts to the loadbars. Not what I was talking about, but they knew that from the pics. Rackoutfitters was nice enough to tell me the FitKit I was wanting, but that it was not sold anymore. The mystery FitKit that so nicely rides the factory roof tracks is a superceded TH4019, as I also found an internet THULE response to my original question:(http://thule.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/822/~/discontinued-kit-4019) only on ebay and craigslist now, but what luck! I found it still available on Amazon UK, and it was $62 WITH shipping after the price conversion, a ridiculous low price compared to the standard $95 for the FitKits. Am I being picky about esthetics? Maybe. But why would THULE be concerned about minimizing wind noise and then have a both ugly and protruding wind dragging item in their lineup? "Wind Diffuser is a textured surface on the t-slot cover that disturbs the airflow better than a smooth surface, greatly reducing wing noise" And BTW, I highly recommend a few dabs of adhesive sealant along the length of the load bars before pushing in the t-slot cover rubber strip. The way THULE kills you on buying the joke-of-a lock cores, (while YAKIMA WHispbar even includes the fake "locks"), that strip must be dear.Note also the way Whispbar single bolt down to the Jeep grand Cherokee factory roof rails, you could even add 4 security nuts in lieu of the red twist nut and make the racks truly theft proof. Still wish I powdercoated the YAKIMA Whispbar, but I will be much happier when I install the 4019 kit...anyone want to buy a gently used 3142 fit kit?

I got this based on all the reviews I read.  I read other reviews of tire shine and they said they didn't last long, sprayed everywhere after application, shine not good.  So I got this stuff and the bottle was bigger than I thought.  You get a pretty big bottle for the price.  And this is quality stuff.  Just spray it on tires like it says and let it sit for like 5-6 minutes.  It pretty much dries to the tire, with some drips that you can wipe away with a microfiber cloth.  Excellent shine to it as well, close to the Tire Foam I used to use which is what I was looking for.  I still think Tire Foam shines a little better, but this stuff will probably last longer than that stuff only lasted a few days.  This stuff is thick and feels like it should keep the tire looking black for at least a week.  Mother's is a great brand.  This is my first experience with them and they remind me of another company and for like 1/4 of the price.

My tires came in a box and looked good as they were shipped.  I included a couple photos and one is breaking the bead of the old tire with my truck... a long time ago you could see people doing this all the time but not so much today... it still works... I think these tires will work good and add the traction I need for some areas of my yard.

Rancho RS978 5/8" hourglass polyurethane shock bushings, Rancho type L1.These are the polyurethane bushings specified by Rancho (Rancho type L1 5/8") for use in the lower mount of my front Rancho RS5136 shocks but the inside diameter (ID) was too large without the use of the original steel sleeves/spacers/inserts, one of which was broken. I had to press the sleeves out of my spare set of Bilsteins and install them with these bushings in order to make these bushings work with my approximately 7/16" lower shock mount bolts.Rancho, for their part, would have reportedly warranted the entire shock for the lower bushing failure (in my 10+ year old second hand shocks) but I didn't learn that until I called Rancho tech support for availability of the upper bushings (Rancho type S42) in polyurethane which prompted them to send me a conventional set for both front shocks free of charge and within a week.There is no mention that the sleeves need to be retained or obtained but the specifications at Rancho clearly state 5/8" for these bushings so my risk for ordering them without measuring.5 stars for good quality polyurethane bushings made in the USA and excellent customer support.

This OPT7 LED Light Bar for your Tail Gate is amazing quality. The led bar came in a nice HUGE box (poorly taped as if someone opened it and then re-taped it very poorly) but the led bar was inside the box, then inside a hard cardboard tube, then inside a clear plastic tube. This thing was packaged so well I think it would survive a bomb or blast, it was crazy how many protective layers the shipping box had.Now onto the product. I installed this on my 2006 Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab 5.7L Hemi. It was super easy to install. Just like they said it is plug and play into your trucks 4 pin trailer harness. I just wiped down the spot under my tailgate i was instalking the led bar with rubbing alcohol and then pushed it on with the 3m tape. I didn't bother to hardwire the reverse lights as I don't want to hardwire anything into my new truck, but the other LED lights all worked and lit up as they should have. The 3m tape has held up so far (4 days) and if it decides to fall off I will update this review.I included 3 pictures. First one is during the day, the lights are super bright even in direct sunlight. The second picture is the led bar at night lit up under regular running position. The third picture is the led bar at night with the brakes applied.Would definitely buy an OPT7 product again on the way the package was so well protected during shipping alone.A+++ Shipping/PackagingA+ QualityA+ ProductB+ Difficulty Installing (hardwire reverse lights)A+++ OPT7 would order from again!!!

Great product ! I have a 2017 F-150 and the fit was great ! Yes you have to use a little muscle to tuck the bottom corners in, but to trim as some did is not necessary.

Great price for a sissy bar and luggage rack. Doesn't come with instructions, but if you have some common sense you can figure this one out. Seems sturdy and strong. One thing everyone keeps saying is an issue is the back rest pad doesn't have pre drilled holes, I like this, you can choose how low or how high to make it. Time will tell how well it holds up to the elements, but judging by the welds and the thickness of the stainless steel I expect this to last a long time! I mounted mine with the luggage rack in between the back rest and mounting brackets, I might adjust it later

At $10 with free shipping and they also come in navy blue, these are a must-have for any car owner. I got these because it is hard to find navy blue in the stores and at this price. For some people they may be too small or not what they expect but at a price so low why not get them and protect your car interior. $10 is easily spent on drinks, coffee, food etc so why not get them to help preserve your car? And when its time to change the look of your interior, you won't feel like you wasted your money. This is the best thing you can spend $10 on. And they come in a variety of colors!

I ordered this kit partially because I had read positive reviews about the sellers customer service practices. So far I'm pleased with them as well.Why the missing star? The product arrived with a broken bulb that was not due to shipping. So for now, my vehicle looks silly with one halogen and one HID headlight. Either way, this gives me the opportunity to really compare the two. I contacted the seller about the broken light and he had a new set in the mail to me the next day. Talk about good customer service. Depending on how the new set works, I'll probably add that last star back again.I purchased the kit by itself, with no additional parts or harnesses. So far, it seems to be working very well. No flickering issues which I was a bit concerned about. Once the second set is installed, we'll see if that creates an electrical load issue, but I don't forsee that.I do have these installed in a set of projector headlight housingso which are kind of a must to get the best performance out of these. Unless of course your vehicle came with HID'so in the first place. The reflector is designed differently depending on the light source.One last side note, I purchased the 5000k set. If you want real performance,  I would go with that or the 4300k (or it might be 4500k, I don't recall). The 5000k is almost tinted more than I would prefer, but I won't comment on the too heavily until I have both installed.

I installed this in my 99 Toyota RAV4 to use along with a snorkel.  I looks kool, is very functional for my needs and will still be more than enough filter when I upgrade to a 3SGE BEAMS engine.  Take a look at my photo of my upgraded engine bay.

The back window tore on install. The main part of the top tore on install. The back window zipper broke on install. This was on a sunny 81 degree Fahrenheit day, after leaving it sitting out in the sun for 2 hours. The original soft top that I was replacing had frozen zippers, so I couldn't put the original back on. I had to keep this broken top on until a new replacement top came. It never fully reached and never would. It was a waste of an afternoon for me and my buddy, and my fingers never forgave me. Obviously, some people managed to make this top fit, so I'm assuming the top has some quality control issues.

Corners needed to be trimmed with dremel tool to fit nicely in a 2011 Jeep Liberty (KK). Other than that, works and looks fine. Take your time with the install and it will come out nicely.

After purchasing the XRC rear bumper for my 2005 Jeep Rubicon, I found that the spare was sitting too low on the factory carrier and was rubbing on the new bumper.  I knew it would only be a matter of time before the finish would be damaged, so I ordered the Smittybilt carrier.  This carrier is very heavy duty and has some really high-end features at any price.  The Amazon price for this item is a bargain, especially with the free shipping.  It was a bit involved to install (more than I expected), but easily manageable with basic tools.  There are a couple of issues that prospective buyers should be aware of when deciding to buy this carrier.  The factory third brake light can be installed on this carrier, but will require cutting of the part and will sit way too high if you are mounting a normal sized (31-32 inch) spare tire.  It might be okay with a large (35-37 inch) tire.  I decided to forego the third brake light on my installation, but now I need to find a rubber grommet/plug to properly close the hole in the tailgate where the factory wire harness came through.  It would be nice if Smittybilt could provide one in the kit.

Bought this a while ago, and although I had not used it, I loaned it to a friend who was having trouble starting up his car. My friend came over today and showed me that it had started to swell up and when I touched one corner of it where I saw a little hole, it swelled some more and caught on fire. I was caught totally unaware. It burned my hand when it caught on fire and went up in flames. I have a video and pictures if anyone wants to see (caught by my security cameras at home).  I contacted Amazon and explained what had happened, and they sent me a return label, and took care of everything quickly. But I want to warn everyone who has this, or is thinking of buying this battery jump starter. BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL...IT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS!!!  EVEN LIFE THREATENING!!! I was thinking of buying another one, but cancelled my order because I don't feel it is safe.

Its nice and holds down gear well, but I always use tie down straps over it so not sure how well it would work without straps, but it does keep all the little stuff from shifting around. Have used it on 2000 miles of road trips so far this summer and it's held up great. The tips of the hooks have a tendency to break, but it will still hold. I use mine on a Rhino Rack Xtray.

Pro:The Jump-N-Carry feels very solid, also the Full size clamps make it much easier to allow you ease-of-use when attaching it to the terminals on the battery. The full size clamps retention spring inside is very heavy duty when opening it up it does take a lot of pressure to get the clamps to an open position to remove them from the Jump-N-Carry.This could be a double edge sword on the one hand you have the retention from the clamps keeping them in a locked position allowing them not to fall off when using them on a battery or when storing them on the Jump-N-Carry. The downside to this is that if you have big hands it's hard to grab onto the clamps because they're so close to the Jump-N-Carry. The heavy duty retention Springs make it challenging just using your fingertips. I like how you're able to check the LED status display to see if the Jump-N-Carry needs to be recharged.Cons:I think that the Jump-N-Carry should've have had a carrying bag that would protect the Jump-N-Carry from any potentially leak / leaking, in the event of a manufactured defect or any type of impact damage to the Jump-N-Carry. ( To be fair they do offer a Jump-N-Carry bag for an additional cost the only problem I see with this is, it's a nylon bag and its more like a dust cover ).The Clamps are hard to connect to Chevy / GM vehicles with the small terminals. The clamps protective covers reduced ability to make a good connection to this small terminals causing an issue of them falling off if you're not aligned properly. With the short cables connected to the Jump-N-Carry this presents some logistical challenges in tight spaces when making a proper connection to the terminals.The Jump-N-Carry LED light is not as bright as I'd hoped. That's just a personal preference and I think the Jump-N-Carry should of came with an LED light that had multiple LEDs inside instead of just the one. and have a adjustable head so you can angle the light to the direction that you needed rather than holding the Jump-N-Carry up because the Jump-N-Carry is fairly heavy itself even though it was small and compact this is still a lead acid battery and something to keep in mind.Suggestions to the manufacture:I keep the Jump-N-Carry in my vehicle this is just for an added peace of mine in the event that I need to use the Jump-N-Carry. By having a heavy duty bag that would reduce or potentially stop any battery acid from soiling or saturating its location would be an added benefit.I would have longer cables and make an adapter for Chevy / GM vehicles that have small terminals to assist when making a proper connection.Adding a foam padding to the plastic bottom to the Jump-N-Carry would reduce the potential for scratching paint and slipping when using the Jump-N-Carry.

This product is exactly what I wanted, as I've seen it before in person. However upon receiving the product and opening it up I was shocked to find that it was damaged in several locations. Normally I would not penalize the product with a negative review, but I cannot blame the shipping for this one. The box it came in was perfectly intact. So that tells me that the defects/damage is due to poor quality and poor craftsmanship. 3 spot welds on the table dividers were broken, one wheel will not turn, one divider is bent, one stand cap is broken, many spots have paint blemishes and show bare metal, and much more. I would normally never nitpick a product for visual defects, since cosmetics won't effect my use of it. But the functionality of it is greatly depreciated with broken or damaged components. Overall I'm very dissatisfied with the craftsmanship of the product. It still functions as a mobile workbench, which is my original intention of use. It's just not the product I paid for. One star. And if you don't believe me then read the other one star reviews. They may not all be this bad, but I'm sure NOT impressed.

With this kit you can make a pair of pretty decent ramps fairly easily. I used only one for a 700LB Suzuki motorcycle with no problem. The ramp will be heavy and bulky though-- it's wood and not aluminum after all. One thing to watch is your board length for the height of your trailer. If you don't get this real close (according to the table included in the instructions) the top aluminum piece is not going to be perfectly flat on your trailer. This will cause the pins to not fit all the way in due to the gap and this can cause potential movement as you use the ramp.The recommended lengths don't include all possible trailer heights so you have to use trial and error if your exact length needed is not on the table. Not a big deal but something I noticed. See pic above of my ramp completed, I added a couple of small side pieces to prevent a tire from slipping off.

I ordered 4 new tires. Three of which are definitely new, by appearance ... all tire hairs are intact and manufacture dates of the three are for 2018. I cannot be 100 percent certain about the fourth one, but it looks as though it may be slightly used, and sold to me as new.  I`m not saying this is the case for sure, but it definitely looks slightly used, as If it came off of a new vehicle, or, was bought and returned with some wear. The tire hairs in the middle part of the tire are rubbed off and the hairs on the outer edges are still there. It does not look like they were cut off as some tire businesses do before selling, but, actually "worn" off. You can see this from the attached photos. I've attached 4 pictures for comparison The new tires have a red line that runs around the tread, that can be clearly seen, whilst the one that looks used has no line and has visible wear to the areas where the hairs were, that can be seen upon zooming them up close. The manufacturing date for the suspect one is August, 2017.

Seems a decent piece of luggage. It is small but that was expected as it is a tank bag and not a tail bag. Actually bigger then I expected given some comments and photos. I can fit lots of small items in there and even a couple of well folded shirts, if a bit lumpy. The materials used are quality enough and I find the magnets strong at up to 100mph and under hard acceleration. I haven't been above 100mph and have a bikini faring with small windshield on my bike so can't say how it might fare otherwise. Construction appears rugged and it does not say Coleman anywhere on the bag, but rather Maddogg. Happy with purchase overall and bag seems much higher quality then a popular less expensive bag sold here which I ordered and lasted 2 months before a magnet fell out through worn materials. Lastly it fits the tank of my Yamaha FZ6 perfectly, and that is very nice indeed. Looks good there, too.

I've had a few UTV covers that I use to store my M416 military trailer outdoors. Most only last a year, blow around, fade and rip. One storm came thru Denver the other night and this held tight and shed water like I hoped. It's black so I expect it to fade but as long as it repels water and doesn't tear I'll be happy. So far I'm very satisfied!

I honestly love these mats! Some say they are a little much, but who cares. I think they look great. Especially at night when the cars interior light reflects the red. I will say they look pretty horrible during the winter, but what mats don't. they are easy to clean, most detail shops can clean them for you. I've gotten multiple compliments from people and I will definitely buy them again once these ware out.

Arrived well packaged, however there is a small "bend" on the line by the thread area where it would fit into the fuel filter. about 1 in ahead of the sliding thread. This makes it impossible to move the threaded nut all the way off, so that I can bend it to fit the line on Chevy Impala. I would now have to make the bend further down then I really wanted to. It's not kinked, but it is definitely not circular and the nut will travel only about 1 inch before it hits the "bend"I am disappointed. I will not return it since I have spent 2 hours disconnecting all the rusty fuel lines and can't wait for a replacement._________________got it to work with some elbow grease and a bend which wasn't perfect. No leaks, drips, and i am very pleased

You will definitely need a 1/2" drive breaker bar, ratchet or if you have a impact tool even better!!! The stock bolts will definitely take some muscle if you're trying to use a 3/8" ratchet to break loose! The instructions are dead on and easy to follow in which it took about 45 minutes to install. I had help from my daughter to hold the seats up as you reach to the rear 3 bolts in order to break them loose and remove them. She also held the seats as I installed the spacer blocks and the three bolts back.  Other than that she loved the new angle of the back seats since she's the one riding back there most of the time. Thank you Ohio Diesel for a great product!

I wanted to give LED headlights a try on my 2000 Chevy S10 truck so I searched around and found that Lasfit had what I was looking for.  Once installed they were very close to the bracket on the back of my headlights but they don't touch or interfere with the cooling fan and I can easily get them in and out without any trouble. I also had to remove a little screw from the plastic mount on the LED in order to rotate the LED slightly to get them to sit horizontal in my headlight housing. (The LEDs should sit at the 3 and 9 o'clock position once inside the headlight housing) There are a few slots for adjustments and then you put the screw back in to hold it tight. You may not need to adjust them for your vehicle but I wanted to point it out in case you are wondering why your light pattern is strange. I am happy with them so far and they are very bright. I hope they last a long time.

Fits my 2017-GMC 1500 Denali PERFECTLY!!!These are way better than I expected!!!  I was a little skeptical from reading other's reviews and when I got the box in....it was the original product box and it was all beaten up!  Then I opened it and noticed the flaps weren't protected by foam; however, NO DAMAGE or scratches (plastic bags the flaps are stored in must have saved it from scrapes)!!! YAY!!!!  They are definitely made of hardened plastic....I would say medium strength; with a little give once they are installed....not sure how they will hold up if they are bent too much.....we'll have to see.Package arrived as anticipated--2 days after purchasing them.  Arrived at 8:16PM and all four mud-flaps were installed by 8:31PM!  I took the advice of another review and made sure to loosen the screws as far as they would go before the lock fell off on the self-locks on the rear mudguards and they went on with ease!!  As for the front, it was as simple as turning the wheel the opposite of the wheel well I was working in and taking off the three mounting screws on each wheel well and reusing the screws to mount on the flaps.  The only extra tool you need is a 1/4" ratchet with a 1/4" apex adapter for the front flaps (package comes with the appropriate Apex); and the Allen wrench also comes with the package for the rear flaps.In the pix, you will see I mounted the flaps on my dirty truck (you can see where the mud-flaps will protect my truck from debris); however, I have since taken the flaps off again, cleaned the wheel well thoroughly and mounted them back on.  Truthfully, I didn't have to do this, they fit perfectly with a little dirt....my OCD kicked in and that is the only reason for it.I really do love these and swear by these flaps.  They save my truck from getting beaten up by kicked up rocks and even better, they save my auto running boards (they store right behind the wheels).  Do yourself a favor and protect your asset....you definitely paid or are paying enough for it and the $74 is nothing in comparison to the alternative of not having them.  No, you don't have to just go with these specifically; but I personally saved a few bucks by doing so....especially with not going with OEM flaps.  Also, I didn't want to drill into my brand new truck so no drill installation was a must!!!These definitely fit great with my 2017 GMC 1500 Denali (Crew Cab)!!! If you get these, I hope you love them just as much as I do!!!

Very heavy duty quality. Once mounted, the bar is strong enough to be your grab bar to haul yourself up into the jeep. Zero play or movement once bolted down. Adequate anchor points for 4 lights with holes predrilled under the tabs so you can run the wires inside. The bar sits very high over the roof of the jeep so that could be an issue with low heavy branches. Powder coat finish is excellent. The locations where the tubes connect have a fitting inside that takes up a lot of room making running wires a chore but its doable.

UPDATE HEADS UP: I lost a lot of air removing the hose my first time out, and the low-air warning light was still on when I'd finished. didn't have time for another go until today...and thought this compressor was broken! I had nothing at all in the LED pane except blue light, no matter what I tried. and I was freaking out because I lost a lot more air taking the cap off and screwing the hose onto the tire. was ready to come inside and contact the seller...but the front left tire was freakishly low and I wouldn't have wanted to drive it to a station for air.so I decided to try again, and this time I didn't plug the compressor into the cigarette lighter until after the truck was running. suddenly I was back in business! for the 29psi front tires I set the compressor to 31psi, and for the 32psi rear tires I set it to 34psi; this way I'd have air to lose in both. worked like a charm and the low-air dash light is off. so happy to be able to do this myself, at home, without having to drag the XL compressor into the driveway (and keep it sand-free). I rest this portable compressor on a clean cardboard box while in use, to protect it from junk on the ground, but I'll keep it in the house rather than in the truck. it could melt in the truck.what I took away from this second use is: DO NOT PLUG THE COMPRESSOR INTO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER UNTIL AFTER THE VEHICLE IS RUNNING!***it's been a very long time since air was available for free at every gas station. the machines now are often out of order, many places charge as much as a dollar for an air-up, and one needs exact change. keeping one's tires properly inflated used to be easy, but now it's a hassle. I have to drag my huge compressor outside, protect it from the sand, and wear ear protectors.finally decided to get one of these portable compressors after reading reviews for many different styles and brands. it's not as easy to use as I'd hoped, but that's because of the rims on my tires. it was difficult to get the hose on and off the "spout" without losing air, and next time I may remove the lugs and rims. but it worked!the carrying case is nice, as are the accessories (this will be good for the exercise balls I use for both exercise and seating). it's great to have four extra caps for the tires, too. another reviewer mentioned that the electrical cord was too short, but mine reached all four tires (on a toyota tacoma single cab truck) with no problem, though I did have to pull the unit out of the driver's side to get driver-side tires, and through the passenger door to get the tires on that side.the setting was a bit problematic, because after I'd set the psi it went to two other types of settings (no idea what those are for), but I did see the correct setting in the window when I began the airing-up process. the button for turning the compressor on/off is big and easy to read, as is the button for the light; another huge plus.directions said to add another .5 to the amount of air desired to avoid underinflation due to air loss, but I never found a way to do just half a pound, so I went one over and still lost too much air (again, the fault entirely due to my rims). I just need to practice getting the hose on and off quickly. the compressor stops when the desired amount of air is reached.don't know if it's okay to leave these in vehicles if the temps in said vehicles will surely be well over 100 degrees for most of the year, so I'm keeping mine in the house with my tools. but I'm thrilled to have it, and over time (as long as it doesn't conk out on me quickly) it will more than pay for itself, both in money saved and in convenience. it's also much less noisy than the humongous compressor. very happy to have this portable tire inflator!

These little covers are awesome!  Priced right and give the Jeep a very nice look without having to repaint the whole damn front grill.  To install, line up the half moon dimples at the bottom of the light and the bezel.  Make sure to fully click them in so they don't end up rolling down the road.

Perfect.  I have a new 2017 Jayco JayFlight 174BH and these fit just fine.  They take a little bit to bend and angle them onto the gutter, but they do fit.  They seem to fit just fine, but since they might come off when driving or if they get hit - I put a screw in them to hold them on better and hopefully more permanent.  I don't think they are coming off easily and a number of people said they just came off soon after install.  This should do the trick.  Haven't had any black streaks down the side of my travel trailer and they are great!

It's the only brand that will not leave permanent spots on my custom painted calipers. I've tried them all including ALL of the brand name cleaners. Mothers formula is gentle yet cleans SO well. A good tip is to always clean your wheels (and brakes) when they are COOL. But even when warm, Mothers never disappoints. SUPER clean wheels and no damage.

I did not purchase my unit from Amazon but I do own this.I've owned this unit for several months. Used it to jump many cars and charge many devices. It can charge my Lenovo laptop. The fan out cable for charging phones and tablets is awesome too. Never got any errors on any devices.I think I messed mine up by accidentally dropping the hood on it. It won't hold a charge longer than a week since that happened. It used to hold a charge for over a month.I'm not sure if something is up with my unit but it will not attempt 2 jumps in a row. The charge status lights start flashing and I prevents me from doing another jump. This may be a safety feature to prevent burning the unit out from fast draining the battery.

Awesome. I have pads that were dirty and filled with wax that I thought was cleaned from using simple green and/or dish washing soap. I used this pad cleaner and total big difference. I haven't used this whiteboard in a while because I cleaned and cleaned it but the old wax was still clogged in it. I used this polishingnpadcleaner and in less than a minute, significant difference. Will buy again for sure. When it goes on sale, again.

Ordered this kit to aid in removal of the center console of my Mazda to work on the auxiliary audio. The tools are well made and just what I needed to remove some panels without damage to the sides of the trim. Granted I only ended up using two of the tools to pry the plastic pieces apart, I may need the other if I end up working on our other vehicles. My only gripe is that it doesn't have any audio tools to remove the DIN style radios etc. But I knew that before buying and didn't need in this car but would have been better deal if it included them. Also, this kit was shipped in an envelope. The tool case was removed from the factory box and smashed down to fit in the envelope then the tools/case was put in the envelope. Glad I wasn't giving this to someone as a gift. I will try to upload some pictures of the smashed box and the tools to show the size of the tools. I was able to purchase this set of trim removal tools at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review of the tools and how well they worked on my car.

Just received this item today and I installed it on my brand new F150 XL S-CREW STX.  So turns out that the holes that are in the bracket under the seat are not threaded for some reason.  So instead of using the two knobs to lock it into place I used one strip each of outdoor/heavy duty Velcro to secure both ends down and then for the middle hole I just took a white zip tie and zip tied it into place for added security.  This is a great storage bin!  Now I can have all my items that I should have or need stowed away safely in my truck (to include my two fishing rods).  I'm giving five stars because the item works as advertised, just the install for my situation was different.  Although I don't mind it because I won't be removing it at all and if I do it's just Velcro and one zip tie to put it back on.  GREAT PRODUCT!!! EVEN BETTER PRICE!!!

Used to secure large Solar panels to epdm RV roof. Very Very Strong. Will buy more in the future as i add panels. Mounted flat without brackets around all 4 sides and used a adhesive around outside to seal from any air underneath to cause lift and strengthen bond. Seems permanent.

Save your time and money, use windex and the newspaper trick instead of this junk. the 1 Star is bacause thats the lowest is can rate.  I applied according to the instructions on the bottle. First off, the film that it left after I tried to clean the windshield was impossible to remove. I left it to dry, tried to buff it off, nothing would work. After giving up and kicking myself for trying something new I tried recleaning the window and Even the windex had a hard time cleaning the mess left over from the rain-x. The best way to describe it is try cleaning your window with Pam cooking spray or WD-40 and expect it not to smear when you wipe it around. Amazon was great and refunded my money and said keep the bottle. I contemplated giving it to my worst enemy as a Christmas present but even I had to draw the line. Needless to say I threw it out so nobody had to suffer through the inconvenience and safety hazard created by this junk product. I was shocked rain-x even allowed their name on this. Somebody at their marketing or R&D needs to get fired if they think this is acceptable to sell. Pic below shows the mess it left. As the title says, DO NOT BUY, buyer beware. Youve been warned.

Fits well and is easy to fit your key in (once you release and remove the actual metal key part from your smart key as shown in the instructions).I bought the blue one and it looks a little purple to me, but I got used to it, and it might just be the lighting where I am (see pictures I added: it looks blue in the pictures that I took).This case provides just enough protection for your key while allowing access to all the buttons and features of the key (at a reasonable price).I was worried that it would be too rubbery and cause the key to stick to everything (mainly my pocket when trying to remove it) but it isn't too bad. Enough stickiness to keep the key from sliding all over the place when set down in the car, but not too much that it is impossible to pull out of a pocket.I would recommend this key cover. I'll probably eventually get a second one of a different color for my spare key.

As everyone else has said this is a very robust unit compared to OEM Mazdaspeed3 BUT1. If you're running a JBR rear adjustable antisway bar in the stiffest position, the larger endlink will contact the frame occasionally and make a clunk. Its liveable.2. Most guys find you need a very very short and skinny 18mm wrench to fit into the tiny space the endlink fits into. Some 18mm crowsfeet will not even work; it has to be a 3 sided crowsfoot, not a hooked crowsfoot. I was able to make it work with a normal 18mm open wrench the second time I installed these. the first time I installed, I used a disposable wrench from an air tool that was 2 inches long. Even a super skinny 18mm bicycle wrench or stubby 18mm won't fit into the space.You'll need an 18 mm very thin wrench for the other side of the end link as well or that same disposable wrench.At least one of the holes for the zerk fitting required the hole to be tapped to get it to fit. The other one was able to self tap.Put the zerk fitting in AFTER you install the upper bolt so you have more room to fit the 18 mm wrench.

These flush mount round stop turn and tail lights ( i bought two) are perfect to customize your Jeep or any vehicle where they will lay flat in the right spot. Three wires come together out of the back about 2/3 of the way across the back. Otherwise the back is flat. No new holes needed except for 3 screw holes for each light to mount them. mount them. They look fantastic on my Jeep Wrangler and much better than the boxy factory tail lights. Very bright and work perfectly! No metal parts on front to rust. Screws not included, get black screws or paint them like I did. The letters dot are printed on the lenses and they are designed for semi trucks and trailers so they are good for on-road as well as off-road use as far as I know. They do not act as reverse lights and have no white LEDs so you will need separate reverse lights.

Awesome lights! I like that these, unlike others I have tried only have the logo itself. The other ones have the circle around them and this looks so much nicer and they installed so easy! The picture was in my garage with the door closed but the light on and during the day so there is some ambient light.

EXCELLENT product. The sleeves are a bit larger ID than factory, so I replaced the factory bolts.One of my factory bolts needed to be cut off anyway.NOTE: on the factory trackbar, there are inner metal sleeves that need to be pounded out to get these new bushings install. I didn't realize that at first, due to rust.The lube that comes with this is some excellent stuff.

This was Installed correctly, it fit my JT 530 chain but it broke on my 07 r1 within a week. Luckily no engine damage.. just broke my chain guard.. save the possible stranded situation and buy a rivet type! Just make sure to use a proper chain rivet tool!

I'll start out by saying these lights are incredible! I've had led bulbs with the "projector" lens in the tip before but the majority of those bulbs are not very bright and typically scatter the light so much that it's useless. I bought these to improve the appearance of a recently purchased TaoTao Chinese ATV (ATA-250D) I wasn't expecting much of a useful light but mostly just to give the vehicle a cleaner look.I was blown away once I fired these up for the first time.. they are super bright and they produce a well projected beam much much much better than the standard halogen bulbs they replaced. If that wasn't enought I hit the high beams and WOW do these things light up! Absolutely worth it!Now the bad... My first set looked incredible and worked for about 1hr before one of the bulbs started flickering and strobing... Eventually it stopped but the bulb was constantly on the high-beam when the other was on the low beam.. I swapped it out with a standard halogen and the issue continued.. which means it was perhaps the other bulbs causing the issue? I'm not sure.. hard to tell, and I won't put it past the Chinese wiring on this ATV.. However when I went back to normal halogen bulbs.. everything is business as usual.I was able to promptly recieve a replacement set and installed them the next day. Everything is working great so far again and have put some more time on them with no issues at all. I will say the replacement set however is deffinately not as bright, but still looks great. As long as they keep working I'm willing to sacrafice some lumens.Overall seem to be well made. I really love them.. I just hope they last!NOTE:The headlights on this ATV are DC (to my understanding) it's somewhat rare that most newer vehicles would have an AC powered headlamp but it is possible, in which case AC power will fry these little LED lights quickly. My understanding is that if your headlight dims when the vehicle idles you're running an AC powered headlamp. If your lights can run off the battery.. you're running a DC powered lamp.

Very simple to install. Works great.Although, learning the ins and outs of the operation/controller functions is a bit tricky and not in plain text when looking at the manual. Trial and error seems to be the way to figuring the settings out. When installing on my 1989 Winnebago I had to modify the old vent hole to fit the Fan-Tastic vent in the roof. Didnt take much, but you will need to use a saw and have some tools on hand.I definitely recommend this to others!

Best car wash soap I have used. I tried a few other name brand shampoos but this stuff just works better. They say there are gloss enhancers in this soap and I truly feel whatever that is it works. It works so well I had passengers twice now tell me that rain x works good... but I don't use rain x. Water just glides off the windshield when using this soap. Rinses off and leaves no streaks.  Many friends have been impressed and bought some for themselves.  A gallon lasted a long time too. I just cleaned up an older neglected jeep and took before and after pics. Big difference even before I polished it. Recently also I  tried it in a cheap foam cannon. Worked great!

To the person that lubed and installed the studs then removed them and returned to Amazon..  You Suck!I live in the Midwest with no access to any local places to get performance products.  I had these studs delivered on a Saturday only to open the box and find this.  I inspected the studs and they looked like they were installed in the block but never had the head installed.  I had no choice but to use these and Amazon gave me back some of the money I paid for them.Amazing product shame the buying experience was not better.

Very satisfied for the price. Took about 30 minutes to assemble and install on the vehicle. Just strapped a large Christmas tree to it and all was fine lol. Not super "beefy" construction, but still very nice and it does work. It's a little small for a full-sized SUV, but still looks good. I will probably purchase an additional extension for it.

These are open on the side and they get so filthy with dirt, debri and especially spider webs. They are hard to clean out and always look terrible. You need to buy solid chocks so they don't become spider webbed filth magnets. And they also fade! So if plastic is fading, it is also weakening. Especially don't buy these if you park your toys on dirt or gravel. You can probably get away with using these if you live in a perfectly clean concrete subdivision area. If you live in the country, will find out what I am talking about. "Buy a SOLID chock" !

This steering wheel cover is made out of high quality materials. It does have a bad smell for the first few days. Let it air out for a few days and then install it. It will require some muscle to install but it's totally worth it. It feels and looks like it came with the vehicle from factory. This cover matches my GMC's interior so perfectly. Take a look at the pictures to get an idea of what it looks like installed. I highly recommend it to everyone.

Junk. I had them installed less than 5 minutes and three LED's on one bar quit working.  Avoid. A couple hours of running wires and connecting the switch wasted.  Now to waste more time disassembling and returning.  So yes, it's true... You get what you pay for.

I have a 1997 F250 4x4 with a 5.4L. It started to give me a 171 code on occasions. Then on hot days (above 85) it started giving me 171 & 174 codes. After checking some forums, I discovered that it was probably a vacuum leak. Just to specify, this elbow is for the right engine bank and is not located on the PCV valve at the valve cover. Use your finger and follow the hose up to the back of the intake manifold. This elbow connects the plastic tube to the intake manifold. If you have the engine running (do this on a cold start), use your fingers and feel around the elbow. You will feel it drawing air in if it is leaking. I tried using starter fluid spray to find the leak but feeling for it was much more effective. Normally you would expect to hear a vacuum leak but I couldn't hear this one. It took me a while and a few weeks to find this leak but I knew it had to be a vacuum leak. If you are looking at this part, you are probably already on the right track. I bought mine at OReilly for only $6.99. Make sure that you have the new elbow before you try to remove the old one because it will surely disintegrate if you try to pull it off. If this elbow is leaking, replacing it will, most likely, clear up a 171 & 174 code and definitely clear up a 171 code.

Fits 2009 Honda Element perfectly. Good quality, fast shipping.  One of the rotors had a chip and it had a circle around it, probably got circled as an imperfection and instead of getting fixed it got sent to me.  I would've sent it back but my car was already jacked up and needing new rotors/pads desperately.

One of the cheapest, easiest "mods" I have done to my truck. Install on my 14 Tacoma took about a minute. Adapter guide on the reverse of the package was correct, as I used the "import" adapter. I removed the pre-installed sleeve and threaded extension and inserted the import adapter into my factory antenna mount, then screwed the AntennaX on. I live about 30 miles south of Seattle and there is no change in signal and still get HD FM stations. As others have reported, it does flex at high speeds, but seems to straighten on its own after stopping.

I purchased two of these based on reviews. As a former auto technician, I've relied on my trusty 18 year old Blue Point USA made gauge. It still functions perfectly and registers same pressure values as all of the TPMS sensors I've measured. This old gauge was produced and calibrated over 15 years ago before TPMS!So I bought two of these Highly rated gauges and one is off by 8psi (lower incorrect value) and the other is about 3-4psi off. Terrible accuracy! I was wondering why when I inflated my tires to 32 PSI on the tire balancing machine, these showed something totally different and my personal vehicle's pressure monitoring system displayed over 8 PSI after adjusting with one of the Jaco units.I've since pulled them both apart and did my own recalibration and got them to read correct, the same as my reliable gauge and the TPMS sensors on my vehicles. Will see how these work out in a few weeks after the tweaks.These were purchased for an off road vehicle, where I need to constantly adjust air pressure. These are so inaccurate, I'll have to carry my good dial gauge just to confirm the Jaco's measurements for a bit till I trust the readings.Purchase at your discretion! These seem to be decent quality inside and almost all machined brass, but if you cannot and do not understand how the internals work, you will damage the gauge and render them totally useless if you are to try and adjust the parts yourselves.In the attached image, these were set to read at 38 PSI to test. You can see how neither one read 38.  All my other precise gauge (s) read 38PSI.

These are Great lights, for the money you can't go wrong. I have them mounted in a cargo trailer and can swivel them to point outside. They are pretty bright and would be brighter mounted on a vehicle. Once the power has traveled all the way back to the trailer I'm not getting a full 12v so Im sure that is dropping the light output down a bit.  I would highly recommend buying these. I have only had them for a short time so if anything changes I will report back!

REALLY good looking Billet Grill! It's actually VERY heavy duty, not light and flimsy as you might expect because of the low price. It's DEFINATELY worth the price. It transformed the look of my truck with minimal effort and minimal cost. The mounting seems a little bit squirrelly, but works. Be careful not to over tighten. Also, I installed mine over top of an excursion grill, which is whats on my 2001 F250, and the two side grill pieces didn't seem to fit as well as I would have expected, but in the end it works and looks great. The middle insert went in perfectly and looks fantastic. It was packaged really well and arrived undamaged. I searched high & low and I feel confident that this is the best billet insert option available for the price. I would recommend it to anyone.

Installed on '07 Silverado 1500 classic with 4L60e. Before installing, I was running at 190-210F in town and 175F on the highway at 75mph.  After install, it's down to 130F on the highway and 160F in town. Installed it in front of the radiation in series with original. I used Hayden PN 397 to use original hoses. I used every bit of the 4 feet of hose so having extra may be necessary depending on application.Attached photo is Torque Pro for Android in case you're interested.

Great product, however it just won't work for my 2015 Genesis Sedan.  I knew when purchasing it, that is for the coupe.  However no one offered this kit for the sedan, so I figured Id give it a try, because I figured at least the threading would be correct.  I was hoping that if anything it would be too short and Id have to create an extension....So it fits, but unfortunately it sticks out about 2.25" too far.  I emailed Grimmspeed to see if they have a shorter option but have not heard back.  If not I will have to see if I can modify what I have or have a new post custom made to fit the rest of the great grimmspeed hardware.

OZ-USA sells the best "cheap Chinese" light bars on the market. Its not as good as the Rigid and Baja Designs lights that I own, especially in the wiring department. But, they are superior quality to the overpriced lights sold by Rugged Ridge, Pro Comp, and others. Basically, these are the best of the bargain light bars.I have had two 20" bars on my RAZR for over a year now and they have performed fantastic and held up to many hours in the rain. I recently installed the 30" curved bar on the front of my new 2018 F350 and it is very bright and appears to be the same great quality.

After reading the reviews, I was worried about fitment, but I was swayed by the proponents. I am glad I was because these are very nice quality. It's very important that the mirror plastics are well cleaned and degreased if you want these to stick well, and I might suggest buying some addition 3M tape for the insides to ensure adhesion. But I'm really pleased with how they look on my truck.

After riding for about an hour, I removed the beadrider and found that the leather in my seat was dimpled (photo attached). Maybe I should have anticipated this would happen, but I believe the seller's advertisement should mention the possibility. That's information a potential buyer would need to make an informed buying decision.Be aware that using this product could permanently mess up your bike's seat, and they are expensive to replace.Along with that major problem, it just didn't work for me. I didn't find it that comfortable. It was like sitting on round rocks.

Purchases like this are why I (and I suspect millions of us) LOVE LOVE LOVE Amazon - one gallon of liquid, delivered to your door in 2 days, fo UNDER $3? (Yes it's an add on item but very easy to keep in your cart and attach one to an order now and then!) Where else in the world can this happen? The only other place we get non-crap fluid for this amount is at Walmart (and it actually may be a bit more on the crappy side than this :) and I really try to avoid these at all costs as the lines go 5000 people deep.Product itself works wonderfully - excellent cleaning, no streaking so far, works great with lots of dirt and gunk build up and again its a GALLON FOR THREE BUCKS - can't beat it. It does kind of look like pee yellow but you will giggle and then pour it into your car and that's that :)Will keep buying this over and over as long as it's so cheap and on prime and keeps performing this well.

Good quality lugnuts that look great I have had them on my car for a few months and I'm happy. They are very simple and look better than chrome. They have not faded and the key works fine.

If anyone has the factory TJ wrangler back up lights they know that you can't see doodly squat with them. These lights do a great job of lighting everything up behind me and have a decent amount of range too.First picture is without lights, rest are with reverse and lights. I wired in my lights to reverse with a simple SPDT relay. Works great.

Weiman Leather Cleaner & Conditioner is a good product if you don't need to deep clean a leather object. It is definitely a light jobs product. As you can see in the pictures, it cleaned my attache' case and did make it look better and feel softer. It was rejuvenated. However, the seat of my car which had an older and deeper wearing and therefore a need for deeper cleaning was not fully cleaned. Furthermore, by only cleaning the immediate surface area, it caused my seat to look even more aged. It did not look younger and rejuvenated.The product is fast and easy to use. You just spray it on a cloth and rub it on your leather object. It doesn't take a lot to do the job. It leaves a fresh scent which is nice. My assessment? It is great for an easy leather cleanup but not so great for ground in soil or stains.

The large rubber coated handle is for gross adjustments only. Not to compress the spring as one person indicated. To compress the spring, turn the C clamp style handle on the bottom. Great tool.

Vehicle: 2016 Subaru Forester 2.5i Premium - FB25 engineThe drain plug gaskets arrived today.  They were all in good shape, clean with no rust.  They appear to be the correct size for my car.  I did receive 10 in each package.  There were two gaskets that were stuck together, but I was able to easily separate them with a small flat blade screwdriver with no issues.I will update this review once I have installed one to confirm that they fit and work correctly with no leaks.

TIP -- Check your mirrors and wiring BEFORE starting your job!!  These are excellent Mirrors.Buttttt, the wiring harness on the right side mirror was messed up.  I had to fix it to make it work.  Unfortunately, it looked like this was a return that someone messed up, and they shipped it to me.  I would have returned them, but I had my truck doors all taken apart already, and didn't want to go thru this again and wait for a replacement.

These packs are very high grade and sturdy, they do not leak a drop. A little pricey but it is bulletprof.Strong  enough to run over and will not break. Can stack stuff on top of it as well. Best way to carry extra fuel with you on long rides.I also purchased the mount, rode during the weekend on rocky trails and it never moved. Highly recommend if you have to carry extra gas.

I have purchased/used MANY different types of 194-size wedge bulbs.  I have tried both incandescent and LED/SMD, and I have tried almost every bulb with different wattages available.  So, I am very experienced when it comes to these little bulbs.  I have searched far and wide for the the absolute BRIGHTEST 194 bulb available, and I have found it.  This bulb is the brightest I have ever seen.  Actually, I think they are probably about 50-75% brighter than JDM Astar's other 5730 bulbs (of which I own many).  While many LED/SMD bulbs are not quite as bright as their old-time counterparts, this bulb is brighter than the Silverstar 194 bulb and any Xenon bulbs I have tried.  I would go so far as to say that they are brighter than Nokya, Halo, or other Japanese "tuner" bulbs.  Also, as you can tell from the photos I submitted, this bulb produces a tremendously pure, white light.  I placed this particular bulb in my marking/cornering light (2014 Cadillac ATS), and the difference is amazing.  So, let me give you some information that will hopefully help you, and that JDM ASTAR may be missing from their listing.This bulb is precisely 1.25 inches long from top to bottom, and 1/2 inch wide from side to side.  It is flat, so there is no need for any further measurements.  The bulb fits in the lens housing for my own application perfectly.  Again, you can see from the photos that there is very little difference in the size of the bulbs.  The bulb produces heat, but it gets no hotter than an incandescent bulb, so it should not melt any housings- as it also has cooling fins/heat sink.  I can confidently state that if you are looking to replace a 194 (or any variation of that size), then this should fit.In a nutshell, this bulb is VERY BRIGHT.  It is also a great buy for the money, since it costs about the same as other bulbs in its range.  I have attached some photos of my bulb and its performance.  Mind you that this is inside during the day, so you have to consider that.If you are on the fence, buy THIS bulb.  All others are sad substitutions.  And, for the sake of saying it, I am not associated with or employed by the seller.

Not name brand, cheaper than name brand. Worth the money - if you are careful when installing.  We mounted two of these on an 2007 & 2008 TTR125 Yamaha.  The first set went well - but the second one's mounting hardware broke inside the handlebar.  The key is to put some tape around the hardware that goes inside the handlebar so it's more snug, won't slip, and if those little tines break  - they will still hold.  The tines are brittle and will snap if you overtighten - or don't use tape.  YOu have to use tape (duct, electrical, whatever).  The actual hand guard is as good as the name brand style - for about half price.

This bag will not disappoint. Extremely well made, good quality, and easily installed. I added this on my 2016 XL883N.Update: After putting a couple thousand miles on the bike with the bag, I am still very pleased with its performance and appearance. I have found you can adjust main false buckle to gain a couple of extra inches when carrying bulkier items.Typically on longer rides it easily holds some tools, bungees and my extra fuel bottle. I still would recommend the bag.

VERY comfortable cushion!  My old mini van has seats that are not very comfortable for long drives so this cushion is really great!  I like the adjustable straps and the cushion does not slide around at all once installed.  They are easy to tighten and have a clip release.  The cushion makes driving more comfy and I like that it doesn't sit up too high. It's not too thick at all. Just right!  When I installed it my van, my kids wanted to sit on it and test it out right away so I took a pic so you can see.  I haven't used it for longer than an hour drive, but I notice a big difference.  It's way more comfortable and I am happy I have it since we have a 6 hour drive to Atlanta coming up soon!  I buy a lot of products on Amazon and I was so excited to be selected to receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  My husband wants one of these cushions too, so I need to order another one.

I have a 2003 Silverado H/D, and these fit exactly like the OEM's.  They look identical, and installed exactly like them.  Like a couple  of other reviewers, who have bought aftermarket, I went thru the extra step of applying a bead of clear where the lens and backing plate attach.  I just wanted the extra insurance that they would not get any moisture inside.  Reading all reviews concerning the different brands offered on Amazon, these get the best review feedback.For the price, buy them and skip a professional attempt at cleaning.  I had mine cleaned 3x, and sealed.  It only delayed the inevitable, They only took less than 10 minutes aside(left/right), to install and give the front of the truck a whole newlook.  After months of use, there have been no leaks, and the clarity has not diminished on the lenses.Update:I had a ARB winch bull bar bumper later installed, and unbeknown to me, the mechanic doing the install broke both mounting tabs on the parking lamps.  I did not realize this at the time, and did not report this damage to the manager.  Because of another install issue of the bumper(shops fault), the manager made good on some other stuff,  At this point i just called it even, as the price of replacing them was much less than what i got in return.UPDATE:05/23/2018,.....These (L & R) side marker lights are my 2nd due to a installer breaking their mounting tabs, while installing a 'bull-bar bumper 4 weeks after the 1st install.  The lamps themselves are/were great.  I had no issues.  I really like the Chevy design on how to mount the front lamps on the CLASSIC truck (2003-2006.5 body style). These new ones installed quickly and easily. No more rattles or walking out of their mounts due to a mechanics negligence. These new lamps are so affordable and easy, that they are a super bargin over trying to clean your originals.

Helmet is a bit noisy but that's not the reason for three stars....My biggest complaint is that the chin strap has become frayed to the point where it is extremely difficult to strap/unstrap - this is only after a few months of use.Pretty disappointed, the helmet is a good value but I guess you get what you pay for.Picture attached.

Installed as low key markers.  Will also strobe with correct wiring schematic and controllers.No instructions included.  You should be knowledgeable with 12V systems.  Wiring is not marked.  Our batch used red for power and black for ground.Be creative with your install.  Improvise mounting as needed.  For this type of custom installation, you will also need to  improvise your own wire run.This is plug & play, if you know how to plug & play.Your real problem will be how you will install this.  No wiring schematic.  No wiring harness.  No switching.  My shop techs laughed when we saw what was included.  You will need everything.  And none of what you will need comes with the product.

This item worked flawlessly to remove the top bank of plugs on my 2008 Dodge Ram 4.7L engine. I give it 4 stars because it is too long to reach the lower bank plugs in the rear of the engine, necessitating another thin wall socket.  For the top bank though,  this is bomb proof and you will get more use out of it (manufacturer recommends the top bank every 30k miles).

These are installed in a '98 Montero (Mk 2.5), in which we do a lot of travel and overlanding. The headrest covers were not installed due to other covers used for gear storage. Wasn't expecting much for the price and time will tell how they wear, but on initial installation and use they're not bad.I looped all the straps and connected them underneath the passenger side using the factory spring hooks (the cover straps failed) and on the driver side using a clip to bring the four loops to center to tighten up the fit. I cut a couple of 3/4" PVC pipes around eight inches and tucked them into the covers between the seat and the back. The fabric is light enough to not effect the seat heaters.

At first the quality of these did seem pretty good although after about eight months the outside black metal portion discolored and now has a brown look to it also when exposed to sun the clear lens portion does fall out as a show in my photos .  For a interior project or a Covered area they might be ok

Well, it's a k&n. Good quality cold air intake. A few things I'd note tho.-Watch the youtube video outlining the install of this on the silverado, it will help, and make things go much faster and easier.-Make sure you get your M.A.S installed correctly.-save your old intake, you might not like the sound.Overall it's great. You can kinda feel a power increase, not much, but try running E85 with it.. really opens up the 5.3l.The sound added is noticible. I have a flowmaster American thunder series installed, and it ADDED sound to my exhaust. The intake noise with the exhaust sounds really compliment each other, especially under a load, it's really throaty and mean.Gas mileage.. well I can't say you're gonna save any fuel with this thing.Why?Because it sounds so freaking American you're gonna be smashing the throttle every time you get on it.Now, honestly, if you can manage to keep your foot out of it, I went from an average of 13.2- 13.8 mpg.. so, a little.. but I do drive with a 7.5" lift and 35's.. so. There is that.Final thought:Just buy it. Youre gonna spend the 260.00 on air filters in 100k miles, these you just add the cleaner every 50.. so. Essentially it pays for itself just in air cleaners, and doesn't void your factory warranty. It's worth every penny.Sounds great, built well, and does what it claims.

Delivered quickly with an email from the seller. Simple install. Go ahead and take out the grill! I tried a few with it in and its much easier with the grill out. The reason why is that you can squeeze the product together with the grill. The grill has too much give trying it without it removed and some tabs do not click into place. Easy installation, great looks, serves a function protecting the radiater and very inexpensive- highly recommended mod!

I must be the biggest idiot.  First of all, I had to remove the rear wheels to drill the 4 holes.  Each mud flaps has Rear LH and Rear RH written on them.  However I started putting the mud flap on the front fender of the wheel, not the back like an idiot.  Then I realized it and had to take off my wheel again.  So I have 4 holes in my fender that did not need to be there.  These fit perfectly and required some work, but the screws are nice and I'm glad I got them over the Weathertech ones. I have a 2013 silverado crew cab and they fit.

Got it in today to grease up my SUV. First couple of pumps where great but then it stopped working. Had to pull off the zerk fittings which is another difficult process and play around with it to find out why it is not pumping. After 10 minutes of twisting and pulling it all of a sudden worked again without figuring out a fix. This was a continuous process for the whole day which was a disappointment. I would rerun it but it is so poorly made that it looks like I had it for years with one single use.Hose arrived pinched, grrrrIgnore the great reviews on Amazon and buy a different one...

This tire separated while I was driving down the road after only having it on my car for less than 5,000 miles. The mechanic that put on my new tire said it was a manufacturing defect he couldn't find anything that looked like a puncture.  I purchased it off Amazon and it's not eligible for a refund or replacement if I'd have bought it from a local retailer. Don't buy this tire if you don't unless you want to be left on the side of the road.

I just laugh when I think how awesome this stuff is!  I took a complete shot in the dark on it, hoping I could make it work to trim out my interior.  I have a 91 integra, and I just finished restoring the inside.  This little trim is perfect to make a more completed look.  If you are able to wedge the trim between two pieces, that is ideal. But I was able to get it in a seam that does not come apart, using a stripe of super glue to hold it in place.  The results are just amazing, and only took me about an hour. I did not measure the piece of trim, but it is very long.  maybe 10 ft?  It is super flexible, allowing you to make multiple turns without damaging the trim.  Take note that I thought I was getting grey trim, and it is actually CHROME. This was a great surprise!  I think it looks really really good and cant wait to show my friends from the car club

I usually wait until I have tested an item for a bit before reviewing it. I will make an exception here and update if anything changes.First off, when many review parts for a bike to me the review is not as strong as it could be if the reviewer does not give the full story. I will attempt to do that for you. So you know the baseline I'm using.My bike is a 2008 Yamaha/Star Raider S. Current modifications are:K&N air filter, Brain's airbox mod. (check mbf Raider forums for info on that.) home made Reaper Tips.I started off with the tune it yourself Cobra FI 2000, after fiddling with the adjustments to get it to tune I got it to a place where it was better than stock. But not as good as I wanted it. It may have needed more fiddling I guess. I do have an extra exhaust system and depending on if I am going to do some distance riding I have in the past swapped back to my stock quieter pipes. Well with the auto tune version I don't need to do that. I installed the auto tune version this weekend while it was raining out. It installs the same as the non auto tune version. If I could offer a bit of advice to Cobra... Give us a little more length to the wires between the plug in connectors, they are already enough of a pain to put on.Today I got to bring the beast out for a test ride...WOW. The auto tuner has given this bike a healthy kick in the midrange. More power off the bottom too. I did not get to do any higher speed highway runs as the roads were still wet and I had other things I needed to get done before dark. I did a few quick roll ons and was impressed with what the tuner was doing for my bike. Not that the Raider needs more power but.....I'm a guy. I think now this tuner brings together my other mods and gets them working together very well. I would recommend this mod to anyone wanting more power out of their Raider.

This fit my 2000 Toyota, rear wheel drive, 4 Runner! It does NOT have pre-drilled holes in it, but it is easy to make holes in. It DOES come with 8,  3/4" Phillips head screws and easy to understand instructions to install the splashguards. I did not need all of the screws, and you probably won't either, but it is nice that they include so many, rather than just enough for the job. The set comes with both the right and left side.  Looks nice on the car and does it's job.  MUCH cheaper than the $109 afterparts replacement for 1 splashguard it would have cost me from the dealer!

Rear struts was the same but front struts not! After install and test feels very bad, you feel every single bump, hole, defects on the road, very stiff  and make your car unstable and steering moves left and right weird because after installation you will need alignment immediately! I will make alignment this week and if something change i will posted. So far don't buy! I'm very disappointed :/*UPTADE* After make alignment and tires rotate, struts feels same absolutely NOT recommended, pay more and get moogs way better.

Worked great till it somehow fell out, though it's possible someone just stole it. I wish it were a little more snug or sat deeper into my CURT hitch.

Had to get a wideband for tuning my 5.2 Magnum swap into my TJWorks good. Had to drill out the hole bigger in the back for my wide band wiring. But works great.

I'm not sure what I expected but this wasn't it.Mine are definitely red -- not magenta, not pink, they're red. They do seem to be aluminum, and they screwed onto my valve-stems with no problems.  So, they're everything the ad says they are.  I won't know for a while if they change color with time or stick to the threads.  But . . .They're so tiny they make no impression whatever when looking at the car.  You can barely see them.  I have no way to test this but I doubt anyone will ever notice they're there.  I'll try to post a picture.

Had the unfortunate situation of a small dent in rear quarter panel on my truck. Got this dent puller and worked out pretty well, as I was able to pull out the majority of the dent and is much less noticeable (am attaching picture to this post with before and after).  I could spend more time on it and get it out more but satisfied with results and only took me about 15-20 minutes.  The process I used was to take the larger circle disk and applied standard craft glue stick (with basic glue gun we have) on center of dent and pressed quickly onto center of dent (while glue was still hot and had movement), let it dry for a couple of minutes and then attached handle (just loops through end of disk) with a gentle pulling action, heard a crinkle and could immediately see the dent pull out a bit.  Repeated this process with some other sized disks and areas of the dent, and got it to the point you see on the picture (much less noticeable). On one attempt (as glue does stick into the groves of the disk and dries pretty smoothly), I just applied more hot glue to it (which is disk with dried hot glue) and pressed into dent area again... let it dry (and worked fine).  I do have the disks with glue in the grooves, and if I need to, I think I can warm up the glue with a hair dryer and use a nail to get the glue out.On removing the disk (after pulling out dent to your liking (as it's sometimes stayed stuck to paint) - remember not to over pull), I used a thin, plastic paint scrapper I had and pressed gently between paint and glue to separate it.  After I was done, I did have some glue that stayed on the paint and as I tried to peel it off, I did press a little too hard and pushed dent in a little so have to be careful with that scenario (I did have to re-pull that area out a bit).  I ended up getting a hair dryer to warm up the glue (on the paint) and used my scrapper gently to get rest of glue off. Still some glue residue on the paint, and used a goo off product (very small amount on a paper towel) to remove remaining glue off.Overall, I'm very happy with results for a minimal cost.

It fit my 2016 Wrangler Unlimited Steering Wheel perfect ... if your looking for some "real world" measurements, 4,1/8" - 4,1/4" (measured as pictured). Heavy build, solid feel, spins nice (though probably not ball bearings). Well worth the money!

This tailgate light is awesome, very bright LEDs even in the day time. Very easy to install and wiring is very easy. Mine is hard wired, but the light comes ready to plug into your 4 flat trailer plug. Included is everything needed to mount this Redline LED Tailgate Light Bar, including a generous amount of wire, 4 flat plug included, to use for hardwiring this light bar. You can't beat the 2 year warranty on this light bar. I don't know about the backup LEDs since I opted not to connect the white wire to my backup lights, I already have bright LED backup bulbs in my tail lights. I highly recommend this 60" Redline LED Tailgate Light Bar to anyone wanting the extra visibility of your trucks rear end. Note: On Monday, March 26, 2018 my truck was rear ended in an accident, damage to the rear bumper was extensive, along with my class IV trailer hitch which prevented any damage to the tailgate, and bed was also protected. The Redline Tailgate LED Light Bar was already installed before this accident, it did not receive any damage, and still works just fine. This is a very high quality product.

Just installed a Curt hitch for my 08 RDX for a bike carrier.  Wanted something that looked good and covered the hitch opening when the bike rack wasn't in use.  This thing looks very nice and expensive in the hitch.  It is metal and chrome; which, I will need to keep clean to maximize the curb appeal.  I haven't had it on that long to see how well it handles the weather with rust.  I had to purchase a locking hitch pin because I was worried someone would try and steal it because it looks so good.  The only thing I would like is if I could of found this exact hitch cover in red to match the Moroccan Red Pearl of my vehicle.UPDATE:  I added a second pic of the hitch cover sitting on top of the hitch after +3 years of use attached 24/7 on the back of my RDX.

perfect for building a bumper for my girlfriends Cherokee looks like quality metal and very thick. I used 2"x5"x3/16" metal to build her bumper and I welded this receiver on both sides. its priced very good for how beefy and quality it is. even though the bumper isn't completely finished we've already used this receiver hitch it to pull her out of the mud and it held up great!!

I bought these a month ago to use them with my motorcycle. Today while I was undoing the straps on the motorcycle, the silver metal piece in the buckle broke when I pressed it with my thumb. The silver piece broke in 2 places and the pieces fell off as if it wasn't made of metal but porcelain. This seems like a manufacturing defect. I have attached a picture.I contacted Sline (the company that sells Ancra consumer cargo products). Their customer service phone number doesn't work and the email address mentioned on their website doesn't exist (email bounces back).UPDATE 7/25/15: I contacted Sline again through one of their marketing channels about the issue and they acknowledged that they had some faulty buckles in some of their production batches, which were recalled by them about 5 years ago. They were surprised that I received one of the faulty buckles. They promptly sent me 2 replacement straps (instead of just one) by UPS. The new straps work as designed, no issues. This is good customer service from Sline, although the only problem with the entire process was that their main "customer service" phone number doesn't work! I give 4 stars to the product, but 3 stars to their customer service.

Love the Jack. Works well. Looks great. Powder coat does wear off quickly on parts the jack itself. I hit it with a mist of rustoleum. Seemed to help stop it. Didn't affect use. You can see in the pics small amounts of rust and where the powder that has scratched off. Typical of use tho, I'm not mad. It includes the red handle keeper.  Donation to cause... Can't beat it. Paired with Rugged Ridge tubes and Hi Lift tube mount.

After buying my 2015 Tundra and struggling with the junk that I throw in the center console rolling around, I learned of this divider / organizer from tundratalk and decided to give it a try.  Short story is, I love it! supper simple an very utilitarian and provides exactly what I was looking for from the factory.I recommend this to any who ask, there are more expensive options but this serves is duty well.

Was able to get these washers to work, but there were opportunities.To start with, the description notes that these washers are made to "fit standard 3/4 d-rings or shackles". Standard 3/4 shackles come with a 7/8 inch pin... since the inside diameter of these washers is smaller than that, I had to force the pin through them. Probably not good for longevity of these washers.Additionally, the listing does not provide outer diameter measurement of these washers. Since my bow shackles also came with washers, I made the incorrect assumption that these would be the same "standard" size (1.5 inch OD). Nope. These have a 2 inch OD.Since I had too much play between each shackle and the bumper mount, I needed to use these in combination with the washers that came with the shackles in order to reduce the play and associated banging. Yes, they look a bit odd next to washers with the 1.5 inch OD, but I put these up against the mount to make them somewhat less noticeable.They work, but the combo is a bit ugly (but hey, it is a Jeep!!)When I need to replace, will purchase washers with a 7/8 inch ID and 1.5 inch OD instead.

I've heard that there are Chinese knock offs that are almost as good as these, but after looking at the specs of those the 6 LED Chinese ones had less output than the 4 LED rigid Dually light.These are great for illuminating the area in the immediate area of the vehicle, but really don't have much reach at all.  If you need something subtle that looks nice than this is what you need.

First of all, these came very neatly packaged with adequate padding. Really great bulb! Plenty bright for the average person although not as bright a 55w HID's. (But that is an unfair comparison) These would also go great in fog light housings!NOTE: Just remember to check to see if you have enough room behind the bulb/in the housing to accommodate these bulbs. Otherwise you may have to use them without the dust cover which is not a great idea.

If you want to lift you Jeep but you don't have insane amounts of cash you want to get these!!! Very easy to install as long as you drop the entire front or rear axle and install both spacers at the same time, instead of doing one at a time. I installed these in conjunction with Rancho shocks and Rough Country 2.5" Quick sway bar disconnects. I have gone of roading on rocks and these held up great. Definitely would buy again.

I used this connector directly on the drain of my camper van sink. With my limited needs, draining into a water can with not much more than toothbrushing water for several days, I did not want to mess around with household drain pipes, P-trap, etc. This piece is perfect! (see photo)

This is a great way to paint something black as a trial to how you like it. If you don't like ti, then you can peel it off. I did exactly that on my charger. Look at the attached pictures and you can see how I blacked out the bottom grill. I did it two different ways and you can see them both. It is best to use this on a warm day so it doesn't start spitting. I had this happen to me.

Great delivery time, nicely packaged, easy install on my 2016 Streetbob. The wiring took some finagling, my fairing had to come off just to make it easier.It's as bright as you'd expect for a daymaker ripoff, just make sure you center the top or your beam will look ridiculous going down the road.Looks awesome, best product for $80ish out there, especially since the next few levels are $150-$400 (ridiculous).

I haven't yet gotten to test this motor; when I do I will return and update my review to increase or decrease my star rating as necessary.In the meantime, I wanted to write this review to answer any future buyers' questions regarding part numbers. When I received my winch, I was concerned I may have gotten a repackaged or counterfeit part based on a discrepancy I found in the part numbers. After contacting Warn, my concerns were alleviated.The part number for this packaged motor is 68608. However, when you receive the motor, the part number stamped on it will read 78866. This is normal; I have verified this with a Warn representative via an email inquiry. So, rest assured, nothing untoward occurred and your winch motor was not repackaged if you find this discrepancy in part numbers. I have attached a screen shot of the itemized part list making up the item 68608 motor assembly package as provided by the Warn representative via email.Hope this helps!

Xr650L (2007). Bigger than stock. It fits ok other than you can't fit both tabs of the cotter pin into the hole if you put the washer back on. No washer, you can fit the whole pin. No perfect, but still a good cheap upgrade. Here's a pic of them along side the stock peg.

this scanner is simple and inexpensive. It comes with a small manual. Very easy to navigate. It is smaller than my hand. It lights up the dispay for easy reading. Don't expect this thing to compete with those higher end scanners. This scanner reads you the codes, saves them, resets them, and checks your other systems such as your oxygen sensors, catalytic converts, and other things. If you have a check engine light on, it will read you the error code. You need to look for that code on the internet or use the small disk that comes with it on the computer. I just look it up on the internet along with the year make and model. It gives you a general start point, so you can know what system to look at. It will not tell you if the system is running rich or poor. For the price, its very handy. I have replaced my spark plug coil packs, my TPS sensor, Mass air flow sensor and other things. It a very good tool to have.

For years I've kept an air compressor similar to this one in my trunk, for use in case of a flat tire.  But the last time it saved the day, it also overheated and warped the plastic on the end that goes in the cigarette lighter.  So when I found this one with overheat control, I knew it would be a good replacement.Unlike my old pump, this one has a digital display, which is loads easier than trying to read a little needle jumping around.  It's also go a flashlight that will definitely come in handy not only for airing up a tire in the dark but for lighting the way in the event of other car trouble at night. It also has a preset shut off -- when your tire hits the desired pressure, it quits -- and overheat control!  I've already tested this little guy out and added a couple of pounds to my tires, and knowing that the overheating that killed my last pump won't do the same damage to this one is a huge bonus.  Oh, and I love the LED light!I have a compact car with tires that need about 35 psi, and this pump has no trouble reaching all four tires (I usually run it through a window).  It's kinda loud, but no more so than any other compressor I've tried in this price range.  It's not as heavy duty as some of the more pricey compressors, so I'm not sure I'd recommend it for super-frequent use.  But honestly, if it helps me out with a flat just once, it's well worth the $30 I paid for it.Frankly, I think everyone needs one of these, but it's an especially necessary tool for a woman or girl alone, which is why I've already asked my dad to pick up one for my little sister. I'm not suggesting that women are less capable than men, but there are different dangers for us when it comes to being stranded on the side of the road, and this little air compressor adds a sense of security in that we can be back on the road in a few minutes, getting to a safer place or the nearest tire shop. With one of these in my trunk, I'm not freaked out by the thought of a flat tire -- I know I can handle the immediately problem myself.UPDATE Nov 2016:  I've occasionally used this if a tire looked a bit low, but it recently proved its worth during what could have been an awful week.  I recently noticed one of my tires was pretty low when I needed to go to work, so I spent a few minutes airing it up and hit the road.  The next day I noticed the same issue with a different tire, so I did the same.  Lather, rinse, repeat, and I ended up using this thing 4 times over the course of a week to keep two tires up for driving.  Mind you, I only drive 4 miles on slow streets to get to work, so it wasn't a big risk, but it did keep me from running late or having to call out.  On my afternoon off, I headed to the tire store and found that both those tires had picked up screws and needed to be patched, but thanks to this pump, I was never left stranded and was able to fix the problem on my own time.

Living in Mississippi we don't have to worry as much about snow. For us, however, frost is just a part of the winter for us. It's great that products like the Ice King exist to make things easier when it comes to removing ice from your window without doing any damage.I got this sample in exchange for an honest review. The first thing that impressed me was the case that it came with to store the ice scrapper and the cloth that accompanies it. Might not seem like a big deal to some, but for me it is something that helps in keeping your car organized and makes finding things like a scrapper easily.I hope you can see from the photos the great details on the scraper, making it something that is easy to handle and the scrapping side is designed in such a way to make sure it is flush on the windshield and able to do the most amount of work in a short amount of time.Love the design and the price, and that makes it something I can gladly tell my family and friends about.

This is one of those items that you hope you never have to use, but if the need arises, it can be a literal life saver.  The entire hammer feels really solid and the hammer end had some nice weight to it, which will help you break the glass when the time comes.  Just hit the top corner of your driver side window and the whole thing will smash.  Flip it around and use the recessed blade to cut through your seat belt if its locked up and you cannot release it.As a temporary measure, I put velcro on the bottom to stick it to the carpet under my seat, but in an accident, that will not likely hold and the hammer could end up anywhere.  I recommend securing it under the driver seat or under the dash where you can reach it.  The glove box will not likely be a good place if your seat belt is locked up and you cant move.  The hammer fits securely in the mounting plate so you can be sure its there when you need it.  I received a sample of this item for my honest review.

Better price than the WeatherTech liners. From other reviewers/images, the WeatherTech drivers side has poorer coverage. Installed with ease. Tacks on the bottom do a great job of holding them in place (they're sharp!). They look great. Especially when they're clean. Lot's of salt and snow where I live. I don't like seeing the salt residue on these but I am happy it's not sinking into my factory mats (the driver side mat is a joke) and carpet. I think these will last a long time and do a good job of protecting the carpet.

Makes the flowing lines of the Sportster stand out.  At least on my 2 tone metallic blue & black XL1200C anyways.Bought bike used, so can not comment on how this compares to the stock seat. My bike came with a Mustang Regal seat that I was nottoo keen on. I wanted a wider seat, but also a solo seat.  This was both in one.  I will say this:  At first instant that your tail hits the seat pad, you think "wow this is very firm, almost TOO firm!"  , , , , , , however, the seat will conform to your own body shape after just a few miles, and it starts to feel like it was custom made to fit your bottom.  hahahaha!  At least, that's the way it worked with my scrawny 5' 11"  170 LB butt sitting on it.  :-p

I returned the MAXTRAY cargo liner I'd initially purchased and ordered this one, despite Amazon indicating it would not fit my 2017 Jeep Cherokee Latitude. I had researched a bit by going to the WeatherTech website (put in your vehicle info at the top and you'll get a customized list of products) and found it would fit (based upon #40656 being the recommended product from the manufacturer).Out of the box I was pleased with the thickness and texture. Durable without being bulky, and the sides being up a bit will definitely contain spills. It took a little time out of the box to flatten out, but it wasn't long before I placed it in the vehicle. It fit perfectly and there was no shifting around once it was properly placed.I'm VERY pleased with the fit and am happy I spent a little more to get it right.I'd highly recommend this product to other Jeep Cherokee owners.  And for all, I'd recommend checking out the manufacturer's website prior to purchase to make sure it will fit your vehicle.

Update: 02-21-2018 3 years of daily use.(see end photo)  About 6 months ago I had to repair a few small rips on my sewing machine. The keys to making it last are care when installing and removing it to avoid a rip that can occur if it is pulled over a sharp corner.  Latex Primer / Paint dramatically reduces sun damage but makes it harder for moisture to evaporate.  Also, if it gets left on the ground and it rains I need to turn it inside out and put it on my scooter so the inside can dry out.Update: 01-02-2016 Still going strong even with the brutal sun of Southern California however... after about 6 months or less the black started to fade so this Sept I decided to paint my motorcycle cover with ordinary latex paint - mixed with primer using my Wagner Air Sprayer.  I focused on the nylon stitched seams to protect the stitching from being weakened by the sun.About a week later I took a spray can and painted the back with Red to make it easy to install and I though why doesn't the company do this because it makes it much easier to install.Best cover I have ever owned in 20+ years of motorcycle riding.  The material is really thick and of very high quality.  Right now I'm using it to cover my 2005 Kymco Grandvista 250 scooter with an extra tall aftermarket windshield and the largest size top case (trunk) that Givi sells.  Quality was way beyond my what I expected at any price.

2008 F150. It's a warm day, took it out to the truck (abt 5 minutes ago) and took 2 minutes to get all the way on. Matches interior well enough, feels nice, not hot. How I did it: There's only one stitch line that comes across from the front lip to the back. Center that at the top of your steering wheel. You should be able to get abt 60% on before it becomes more difficult. The three tricks are 1. Make sure that as you progress slowly down the sides of the wheel, what you have already slipped on has even coverage front and back. 2. On whatever side you're on ( you want to progress a little on each side as you go) pull both lips open/over the wheel so you can simply twist the cover to get a couple inches on before going to the other side, and 3. Keep constant pulling pressure on the bottom ( not TOO much), just enough to keep from losing the progress that you have made thus far. When you get this thing at 60%, when you first have to start working to get it on, it will look too small to fit. Trust me, it's not. It will only appear thay way because it's got a half-in steering wheel taking up its slack. When you get close to thebottom just remember to keep the lips open and twist it on little by little. The lips will have a gap between them once installed, just make sure one isn't wrapped around more or less then the other. An EXCELLENT value. Would put on new car just to preserve wheel. Enjoy!UPDATE 8/20/2015: it's been a few weeks. There is still no odor, it is still very on and comfortable (hasn't slipped at all), I don't notice any material coming loose at the seam and I am very used to the feel. I like it. The top of the wheel had a spot where the padding had been worn away and this cover fixes that perfectly. Can't even feel it. Added pics.

Odds are good that you don't need more light than this. The instructions are good, but the install kit is a little on the simple side. The plastic covers developed cracks somewhat soon, but they weren't in a place that would be visible to others, and didn't effect function. The back of the light is flimsy, but seems strong enough once you bolt the whole thing together. If you buy it, consider looking for an illuminated switch that looks good on your dash, some wire ties, and either wire loom or electrical tape, so you can get the wires properly routed. I had this on my last truck, and I mean to buy the same lights for the next truck I buy.

Received my 1st cover and some of the seals had falling off in the box. Gaps in the seals at the hinges and other foam seals had imperfections. The 2nd cover, one of the seals came torn, the rear tailgate seal is already coming unglued. The 2nd box arrived looking like it had been opened by a 5 year old at Christmas! Don't call Extang if you buy something on sale and the seller has raised the price after the sale has ended, they won't cover anything! The customer rep acted as if the exchange was coming out of his pocket and would not offer any help! I sent them my purchase invoice from my Apple computer and he couldn't open it to verify that it was a new cover purchase, just completed within 3 days. Extang is terrible at backing their products! Got Chrome's customer service is awesome, they had shipped the 2nd cover before I could even get the other one to Fed Ex. I'm just not happy about getting 2 defective covers sent to me back to back. In summary, buy another brand of cover and get your moneys worth.

These REAL Philips bulbs are made in Poland and work well. 5 Stars for being the closest Halogen bulb Ive had to be almost White. Poland and other countries don't pay for the DOT Approval which costs consumers more money. I installed these on a Land Rover Discovery II Trail replacing all 4 of the German made Philips bulbs. These are the same output on this British vehicle but definitely more white both high and low beams. Note that these are UP-TO 130% Brighter than some OTHER BRANDS and some STOCK bulbs. Meaning that they could be brighter than what you currently have... or not but they seem to be great quality and don't wash out like some bluish white Zenon STYLE  bulbs which are DANGEROUS in foggy weather or snow. The unique packaging is great for not allowing these (I received 4) from shaking around or being damaged in shipping transit and most importantly, allow removal WITHOUT MAKING FINGER CONTACT to the glass portion of the bulbs. If you touch ANY glass bulb, be sure to wipe it off with a clean towel to remove your skin-oils and the bulb should last substantially longer. Thanks for reading my review.

Have been using for about a month now.  Worked great but I found a tear where the stitching meets.  I'm pretty sure this was not my fault as I do not jam the cover on hard and have not had any 'snags'.  I have another nuzari cover I'm using now that works great.  Maybe this one was just defective.I would buy them again.  Hopefully can return this one.Edit: customer service is great. Will send a new one.

*Update*  I traded the 2007 Camry in on a 2017 Civic Si Sedan, I kept my backup LEDs and popped them into my Civic. Holy crap these things are amazing, no sing of wear around the contacts and still are as bright as ever, and make great lights for my new car's  backup camera!I've purchased other various bulb sizes from this manufacture and gave these a try as well, just like the other ones, I'm really impressed! Great light output and super bright, I used these for My reverse lights and won't be going back to incandescent bulbs as long as I can help it. These fit beautifully and don't make contact to the lense housing in my 2007 Toyota Camry, five stars!

First I want to say I received this running boards free to test them out, doesn't mean I got paid to do the review though. I installed the black 6" on my 2014 silverado crew cab and I must say they look beautiful on my truck. They have a slim profile so they are not eye popping, being 6" wide made it perfect to step in and out of the truck. My only complaint was the front passenger bracket, I don't know why they send it as a 2 piece when a 1 piece like the rest could have worked out fine atleast on my application. It took me about 1:30 hours to install them by myself. I like how I can adjust the steps in an out about 1" which worked out great becasue they were hitting my fender flares but I pushed them out as far as I could and they clear good enough. They also look better for me like this as my tires stick out from the truck so it fills in that space really well. Overall this steps look and function beautifully, I would definitely recommend them to anyone.

Very easy to install attached picture of instructions, roughly 10 minutes, from getting one 13 mm wrench from tool box to remove the center bolt and loosen two top bolts on tail gate, to installing the Pop lock. Back to tool box for a flat blade screw driver for use on one-way 1/4 -20 screw in place of the removed center bolt, off of tail gate. attached pictureLooks good and it worksHighly recommend for Chevy Truck tailgate

As the title states, I was expecting a bit less in quality for a $35 muffler, but the quality is almost damn near close to Flowmaster's welded/chambered mufflers. Not sure if the chambering design on this muffler is similar to the Flowmaster Super 40 Series Delta Flow, but that's pretty close as well, so this is pretty much a cheaper chambered muffler like the generic Summit Racing chambered mufflers. I simply wanted an axleback exhaust setup, but I also ended up getting this muffler welded backwards, but the dual-chamber design should've still provided more/better flow than the restrictive OEM. I ended up getting one welded onto my 2015 Honda Accord LX sedan. Sounds great and not loud at all, but quieter than a muffler delete. Drones a tiny bit above 2500 RPM.

These wheel covers are pretty nice.  They look better in person than they do in photos.  Don't believe the person who said that 56mm center emblems fit though.  They don't or at least they don't fit inside the circle.  I used an epoxy resin to attach mine and so far so good.  I should've measured the circle to help out people but I forgot.  Look pretty nice on my 2012 Sonata.  They are just hubcaps so don't expect a miracle.  Fit was good and I don't expect them to come off unless I do something stupid.

This was listed as a replacement for my 2014 Jeep Patriot.  The size and everything is correct.  The only gripe is the pain of an install.  The wiper arm only lifts so high, which causes an issue of the end of the arm (the loop) being able to slide through the wiper to clip on.  In the end I had to bend the small tab inward to allow enough clearance to do so.  I tried my best to take a picture.

First of this is an actual OEM Ford part, so the fit and function are perfect. You won't find a better price for this part.  This will fix a no crank condition due to a worn ignition on many Ford models.That being said, I installed this on my 2008 Mazda Tribute since they are identical to a Ford Escape. And just to show that they are identical, I took a few pics of the original "Mazda" igniton which has FoMoCo (Ford Motor Company) embossed right on the bottom of it.  This part fit identical to the stock igniton.Also I know most people take the airbag and steering wheel off, but I managed to replace this without removing any of that. Removed all the plastics around it, all the electrical connectors, three 5.5mm screws, and the blind bolt and you'll be able to wiggle it off.

Put these strips in my trunk and purchased some more going to put them under my hood these are extremely bright. Just a heads up these are not 5K(white) but have a more of a calmer very slight hint of blue so they are closer to 6K(white with hint of blue). Not sure exactly how much power each strip requires but its definitely less than an amp if you are worried about causing a short. Comes with double side tape so all you have to do is peel and stick.

I don't like the gap because we live in an area where I'm a slave to pine needles and they along with dirt will fill in this gap (see video).I may tape off the area and fill the gap across the hood with clear silicone.I think it should fit snuggly against the hood.Update:the first review was installed on a 2013 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon. This time around I'm installing it on a 2018 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon Recon (JK Model). I knew I'd have an issue with Recon hood but this is the BEST deflector I've been able t find for the Wrangler.I was able to fit it around the "bump" in the hood and it did seal down on the rear better than on the 2013.I installed it while the engine and hood was hot so it would be easier to mold over the bump.  If the double-back tape doesn't hold it down on ramp up to the bump I'll fill the gap with black silicone.Still love this deflector. The tailgate cover went on without any issues.

2006 Hummer H3 3.5 I5First off idk why they put such a measly engine into a Hummer... BUT, this is an inexpensive way to boost HP, torque and fuel economy. I highly recommend. Easy install and it was fun doing. Sounds weird but working on your vehicle forms some sort of bond,anyway, engine noise was much more significant when reving the engine or flooring the pedal. Sounded like i added an exhaust system, keep that in mind when adding this.I have this and a Gibson exhaust and together they make for a very significant performance boost.

My Fanatec H-Pattern shifter finally bit the dust and I needed something to shift while playing Euro Truck Simulator 2.  This shifter is great!  The quality is really nice, well made, almost all metal.  The gate feels perfect, and the tension is even adjustable.  You can swap from H-Pattern to sequential mode by just unscrewing a few alen head screws and replacing the shift plate, although I haven't used the sequential shifter much because I've got a separate one.  The software is also really nice, lets you customize the location of the throw of each gear to make it more or less sensitive.  Mounting is nice too, I have hard-mounted everything on my rig except for this shifter.  The clamp mount is actually strong enough so that you can crank it down and it stays put, even under hard shifting.  It's got a nice solid steel bracket with a thick rubber pad so you don't scratch up whatever you'e mounting to.  Amazing shifter for the price.

Nice unit- in fact, I have a friend who saw this in my race trailer and was completely envious of the cold down work surface.  We used it that weekend as a surface to rebuild a fuel pump!My one complaint- the size is kind of deceptive.  It can hold a 5qt oil jug when the label faces you, as it would display at the store) however the height of the shelves only allow this on the top rack.  The 2 lower shelves are good for spray cans, but won't quite accomodate a standard 16-24oz spray (like windex bottle).  Its a great u to for keeping much more than I was able to before, and it all stayed in place on a 1200 mile round trip race weekend.I debated and shopped and waited and debated.  In the end, I feel this is the best option for me- and I can always install more shelving to hold more quantity of oils that I usually bring (4 jugs of 5qt each).  I would recommend.

I selected these LED daytime running lights because of the reviews, which were better than similar led lights. They feel very light, cheap, the LED reflector area is scratched up, imperfect, diappointing. Each light has 2 bolts that stick out of the back for mounting. On my 2008 Honda Civic, I used the lower portion of my bumper to mount, this location is a cheap plastic area that is not painted.The bolts just screw into the back of the plastic light assembly. One of the bolts is hallow to allow the very thin wire to pass through. Now, the wire is extremely thin and seriously, there are 6 strands of wire in the wire housing. My wire pliers smallest hole is 18 gauge and that didn't even come close to cutting the wire sheathing off. I think the wire laughed at me while I tried to strip the housing off.I used crazy glue to lock the bolts into the back of the plastic LED light assembly. If I didn't, it felt like the bolts would vibrate out. The nuts that screw onto the bolts were cut crooked in the included washers had chunks missing. Once all this was assembled, I crazy glued this too. Just to ensure I didn't lose anything.With all of this said, I would rate the product 1 star. I'm giving it 3 stars because amazingly it actually works. I will update if I come across any issues. I'm afraid the first rock that hits one of them will turn it into a plastic pile of rubble.

Have been using this product to clean my windows and headlight diffusers with excellent results. Unfortunately I did manage to get some paint overspray on my glass and with a little work it did remove it. Will also remove any baked on dirt and grim. Leaves the surface smooth, streak free, with a clean shine. The attached photos shows the glass light diffusers in the lights, but it was not used on the outer lens as that is plastic.

These look and fit great in my 2016 crew cab Dodge Ram. This is the third set of weather tech floor liners that I have owned. I have tried others in the past including husky. I personally believe that these are the best you can buy and are a huge help with all the stuff my kids track in the truck. They are on the expensive side but sometimes you get what you pay for and if you want a great quality floor liner that will last then I would recommend weather tech. Also must say the shipping was twice as fast as originally projected!! Another great bonus :)

I drive a 2008 Toyota Camry CE (base model) and there was no trim letters and just an empty space where they would be, so I decided to get this product to fill the place. It was really easy to install and it seems very strong, so I'm sure it will last many years to come. It looks really awesome and of course has a even greater meaning. I definitely recommend this product.

I have a 2014 Unlimted, but my review will basically cover all years (2dr or 4dr) since the kits are almost the sameI purchased this hardtop insulator kit a few weeks back and couldn't be happier. The kit is very well made and fits the hardtop lines perfectly. Installation takes about 30-45 minutes and can be done by yourself but a second set of hands would help. You can notice right away that your cabin is quitter while driving down the road, but more importantly the lower temps. With it being 110-118 outside here in Arizona during the summer this insulation kit is a must. I'm seeing about 15 degrees temperature change in cabin after install of kit. I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking to cool down their Jeeps in the summer or keeping warm during winter months. While the sound deadening was nice perk, the temperature change is what sold me.I did a write-up and installation guide for anyone that would like to see before purchasing!http://www.jk-forum.com/forums/jk-write-ups-39/rugged-ridge-hardtop-insulation-kit-write-up-install-guide-325753/ (Copy and paste link)

They're...alright. If your bulb is dual filament, you only get half the power for low beams. While it does cover the road, it doesn't appear to do as good of a job as regular halogens.High beam fills the road nicely, but doesn't seem to throw out light as far. For the money, I'm not going to complain much.These went in the factory housings on a 2011 Ford F-150

I am soooo glad I got this kit for my TSX.  The heat from track school wasn't able to warp these rotors and the brake dust that has plagued this car since new is virtually gone.  The holes in these do have a chamfer to prevent cracking sometimes seen on drilled rotors, mine have a year of daily driving, 2 days of track heavy racing school, and a day of time trials on them so far without issue.

LOVE THIS SETUP! I have a 2007 Silverado 4x4 Z71 Crew Cab (New Body Style)If your mechanically inclined with support stands, a jack, an impact, and a cutting tool (my factory UBolts were so rusted I had to cut them off with a metal grinder) Then you can easily have your truck leveled in 4 hrs.Cons:1. Instructions should have torque specs for vehicle specific installation (I had to verify UBolt and Ball Joint Torque Specs via Chilton)2. The rear lift block is canted slightly with an angle....installation does not specify the direction of this slant (I faced mine towards the front of vehicle)3. Would have been nice if they supplied two lower leaf spring bolts that pass through the leaf springs and sit on the blocks. Mine were so rusted one fell off and the other was so rusted and rounded it wouldnt sit properly on the block (had to use dremel to round off to sit. These bolts ensure all your springs are aligned.Pros:1. Fast Shipping!2. Easy installation, drop shocks, add plates, bolt back on, rear drop ubolts, put in block, tighten. DoneIf the thought of doing this yourself is intimidating....then listen to me...this is not rocket science.....if your up for some MAN pride then this is an easy kit to install. My truck has 200,000 so I ordered two new upper control arms with ball joints and two new lower control arms with ball joints (ACDELCO), just for reassurance and a set of Hellwig helper springs since I was already messing with the leaf springs :) So my install involved removing front axles for lower control arm installation adding a couple more hours of work.  After installation I made appointment for wheel alignment. (you should definitely do this after install for front end component integrity)All and all VERY happy with the cost and workmanship of the material. I thought I was going to snap bolts tightening them, nope all the way to torque spec. My rear UBolt Torque per Chilton was 145 ftlbs, front axle nuts 185 ftlbs, upper and lower ball joint 45 ftlbs plus 130 degree snug, upper spring housing nuts x 6 was 65 ftlbs, wheel lug nuts 85ftlbs. ENJOY YOUR BAD ASS TRUCK KIT!T

Perfect fit in my 2006 Buick LaCrosse CXL. The gasket is built-in, as you can see from the Delco photo. It's wedge-shaped so as you tighten down the water inlet housing, you also push the gasket farther and tighter into the thermostat recess. Yes, this has an "S" stamped in it, as in Stant. But it's also stamped "USA".So ignore the guys who scream "No gasket included". YOU DON'T NEED any other gasket. I've attached a couple photos for reference.

They work perfectly and look great! I wired them into my parking lights and I haven't had a problem with them. They are good quality lights. I've had them for a maybe two or three months and I've had a lot of snow and mud crash into them and it hasn't affected them at all.Update: Ive now had them installed on my pickup for over two years. Theyve survived plowing into snow banks and being submerged in water and they still work as if they were brand new!

Went to.check my oil level after a 2000 mile trip. The sip said above full ( above the full mark) I thought that was odd. I kept the oem dip stick in the trunk. Checked the level again. Two quarts down.  Update: I took the factory dip and put it next to the craven speed. The craven is more then an inch and a half longer. Meaning when your a quart low it will show full. And two quarts low that your only a quart low. Don't blow your engines. Picture attachedUpdate: craven speed sent me a new dipstick, great customer service but bad quality control.

I have this mounted on the top of the front bumper of my 2008 Silverado. It fits perfectly there. I've attached a photo comparing my 35 watt HIDs to the light bar. The HIDs are off in the picture with the light bar.When I received the light bar, I double checked the tightness of all the screws, only a couple were loose. We just had very, very heavy rain here, no leaking. This thing is bright, appears to be well made and amazing for the price. Get this light bar, because the only thing better would be a Rough Country or Rigid, which cost hundreds more.I've owned this light for a month. It's been through 3 rains and a car wash, no problems!

These are the best spark plugs for the mercedes m119 engine. Ive been using these for years and on the m119 platform if you use any other spark plug the engine will misfire. I recently thought i should give the new revised plugs a shot and the car was having issues of stalling out when coming to a stop (98s500) so i tried the revised plugs on a 97 s500 same thing occured and lastly I tried it on my 99 s500 and same exact issue happened again. So then i thought i would try it on a 94 400e and same exact issue. I personally change plugs and oil once a year (i usually drive 3000-5000miles a year per car). I mean these are the cheapest plugs for this engine and they work the best. Dont forget to check ththe gap and properly torque them, do not use anti seize on these plugs its not required.

I like them and after cutting two matching holes in my hood the hot air is rising out and not staying trapped in. (just as planned)But there is one small catch, they are not rectangular, take a look at the pictures I've attached.I added rivets to each corner to make sure they don't accidentally come off due to heat loosening the double sided tape.

I received my new KR1100, 1100 Watt inverter today and have been testing it; so far so good.  At the moment I have it running both a 100W light bulb and 26" LCD TV while attached to a deep cycle battery.  It is showing a wattage draw of around 250 Watts, well below its rated capacity, but a test just the same.  I was a bit alarmed when I put a multimeter across the AC receptacle and only read 94 vac, so I sent a question about it via Amazon to TechBuy where the unit shipped from.  BTW, it got here the second day after being ordered.  Within no more that two minutes after clicking send I received a phone call from TechBuy to discuss my concern.  Seriously, it was LESS THAN TWO MINUTES!!  That's what I call fantastic customer service and I was in the customer service business for 35 years!!  When they asked me if I was using a True RMS multimeter I knew immediately that something I was wondering was correct--I was not getting a real RMS reading.  Anyway, the TechBuy person gave me a couple of quick tests to perform, like comparing the light output of a incandescent bulb and if the TV works okay, the unit was putting out what it is supposed to.  It passes both tests with flying colors!  I will update this down the road after I get it installed in our travel trailer and get some realtime use on it.  But for the apparent quality of the build, all the extras it came with and most of all the awesome customer service I give it five stars at this time.8/26/2015 UPDATE:  I installed this in our travel trailer and it works great.  Here is a picture of it putting out 978 Watts without problem while driving the microwave in the TT.  MY 5-STAR RATING REMAINS VALID.  About to leave on a one month tour and will be using it quite frequently.  I will update this review again after I return.10/7/2015:  We did use this a little bit during our month-long, 6,000+ mile RV trip out west and it performed flawlessly.Update 1/13/2018:  It has now been installed and used for 2 1/2 years, including a trip from Florida to Alaska and back and it has performed flawlessly.

I don't know how most people use these carriers, but I assume there are many people like us driving a touring SUV (great suspension, used only for highway, light road) carrying game consoles for the kids, kitchen stuff for vacation/holiday meals and maybe a folded Christmas tree.  I cannot attest to how this setup would work for off-roaders hauling tree removal or other heavy equipment.Many of the reviews discuss cable length and routing.  Based on those reviews and the fact that we're heading out for a mountain Thanksgiving trip, I needed these now and had to hope issues had been corrected as many of the reviews are from 2011.I've uploaded 4 new pics on our also new&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rola-59502-2-Steel-Cargo-Carrier-2-Piece/dp/B0016I8E1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rola 59502 2" Steel Cargo Carrier - 2 Piece</a>&nbsp;because, from everything I can see, they have resolved the issues and these are a GREAT, economic add-on to the Rola carrier.Because of the reviews, I hit a local retailed yesterday for an 18" 4-pin extension just to ward off any headaches.  I wouldn't have time to be splicing wires.  Turns out I didn't need it.Installation was a snap, the wires were near-perfect length.  As these lights fit multiple carriers, I can only assume there will be more slack on some carriers, less on others.  I ran the short run to the left side light (same as the truck connector side) and ran the long side to the right.  The right side was about 10 inches long, so I just looped it.  I ran the wires through the mesh and along the bottom rail - hardly visible and won't be crushed/crimped if set on the ground for storage/handling.The light gasket is slightly smaller than the carrier openings, but expand once the light is pushed into the gasket.  The earlier reviews left me to expect that the lights would pop out pretty easily but I pushed on them hard and they held.  Obviously, if cargo is loose and hits a bump on the road, they could feasibly be knocked out, but a) my cargo will be firmly strapped down and sitting on anti-slide mats and b) I wire-tied the wires up close to the light so there is slight play for them to pop but they would not hit the ground/drag.So, all in all and without a road test behind us yet, I'm thrilled with these.  I will update this review should anything surprise me.

This is a fantastic looking grill that, along with new headlights, gave my truck a complete facelift.  It came packaged heavily wrapped with bubble wrap, in perfect condition.The radius at the bottom corners does not perfectly match the bumper, but the four people that have seen it so far don't even notice it, and it doesn't bother me a bit.My truck thanks you and so do I.

I've bought the white light before for underglow visibility when riding in canyons or on freeway. As I was cutting through traffic I was almost side swiped by this idiot that didn't want to turn their big head befor changing lanes. So I bought these amber ones to put up high on my apes to have better visibility in traffic. They are the best damn little lights you can get for this price.

Pros: Perfect for stock Jeep JK or up to 2 inch lift. So much easier than crawling underneath to unbolt your sway bars and more articulation than the Rubicons electronic disconnect.Cons: You must be on level ground to reconnect. After a muddy day can be a bear trying to get the pins back in.

Good replacement for my BMW X5 e70 diesel.First time replacing it myself.  Didn't realize the lower foam/cotton layer is really part of the filter.  At first thought it was some padding for shipping.  Almost ripped it off.  Lucky.Photo shows first on schedule change after the new car warranty expired.  Old filter is very dirty.

I insulated the underside of the center console on my side by side UTV.  The engine heat was radiating through the center console and this helped reduce that heat.  Also, this was thin enough that I could install it and snap my center console back in place.  It was both easy to cut and work with.

Well- its clear, the previous white cover always bugged me, especially setting at table was right at eye level.  Trimmed height to about 11 3/4" which was anticipated.Installed cover, slid over to handle and a good 1/4" gap at top.  Hadn't noticed until installed but covers lead edge wasn't square to bottom edge or its handle or reinforcing rib at front?Minor but shouldn't have been required,  But it is clear easily trimmed so only dinged a star.

I've been using the 303 UV Protectant since I first purchased my Acura MDX back in early 2013.  I use the product on all the vinyl/plastic surfaces inside and outside the car. I apply the 303 with a microfiber cloth; usually spraying on the cloth first, and then applying.  This helps avoid overspray.  The intense Florida sun can certainly wreak havoc on our cars, but the 303 protectant has done a great job at protecting the dark color on my dashboard and doors.  Unlike some protectants that can leave a greasy, shining and reflective surface, the 303 protectant brightens up and provides depth to the plastic without the terrible "shine."  Because it is a water-based product, it will last much longer on the inside of the vehicle versus the outside, where the heavy Florida rains will quickly wash it off the back bumpers and mud guards.As a "protectant" I'm very happy with how my car's dashboard has maintained it's color over the past 3 1/2 years (60K+ miles) and I attribute this to the 303 protectant.  I've also been using it on my Weber Grill cover that is kept protected from the rain, but in the direct sunlight and I haven't noticed any fading on the cover like I experienced with previous covers that I didn't apply the 303.  As noted earlier, if you apply it to surfaces that are exposed to rain, you will need to reapply more often.Like most Amazon shoppers, I count on honest, unbiased reviews.  I hope you have found this review helpful in making your purchase decision.

Bought these back in February 2017, Worked great, very pleased.  BUT here it is September 15 2017 and one already failed.Im' not seeing where I can contact the manufactures to see what they will do.  Maybe after reading this they will contact me.$95.00 Bucks is a lot to pay for only 7 months of use.They are Very Bright, but like any headlight you need to aim them properly, these also allow you to turn them in the mounting hole in order to change the beam pattern. I LIKED THEM WHILE THEY WORKED.BUT DON'T BUY THEM. ONE OF MINE ALREADY BURNED OUT IN LESS THAN 7 MONTHS. SAYS 2 YEAR WARRANTY, THERE IS NO CONTACT INFORMATION TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURE. NOT ON AMASON, NOT IN ANY OF THE PAPERWORK NOR INSTRUCTION BOOKLET. EVEN LEAVING A 1 STAR REVIEW TRIGGERED NO RESPONSE FROM THE MANUFACTURE. AMAZON ANSWERED, BUT OFFERED NO RESOLVE.

Edit 04-14-16:  Both struts  malfunction around the same time.  They didn't completely fail, but the seals on them became loose and lost most of their resistance.  Because of this, they would also creak over every imperfection in the road.  APX sent me a replacement immediately, but I won't be installing them.Original Review: Appear to be high quality and a superb value.  These are about 1cm longer than the OEMs in my 2007 mazda 3. Not sure if that's by design or due to the age of the old struts.Just installed today.  Will update if there are any issues.

The light output is decent enough for an ATV to use for driving at night, but I wouldn't recommend counting on these for a full-sized vehicle. As the title says, they are "off-road" lights. I have them on my Jeep mainly for lighting the way at slow speeds in off-road situations... Most recently, I used them for driving through a campsite area at night where I didn't want to light up the whole place with my headlights. As other reviewers have mentioned, they are *not waterproof* at all. Within a couple of weeks (if that), they started to show moisture on the inside of the lens, and this is AFTER I used silicone around the perimeter of each lens. Clearly, that wasn't enough. When I have the time, I will disassemble them in an attempt to remove the moisture and create a better seal. I docked a star for the moisture problem. Other than that, you get what you pay for... For what I spent, these work as well as expected. Recommended for limited off-road lighting.

This tool does what it claims to do. If you take into consideration its price and its being manual verse automatic, it does a very good job. I didn't find I needed to do the 'cut a 1/4" notch' and reposition the spacers as another reviewer suggested. It sounds like a very good idea though if needed. I did find that securely mounting it to a stable bench or welding table that is about waist high, plus placing a couple of wood slims between mounting base and the bottom side of the tool that fits into the mounting base really helps to make the tool stable and it doesn't move around while un-mounting/re-mounting a tire. You have enough things to do working with changing a tire without having to also do a balancing act with a moving target. Having the tool mounted at waist high provides you with the opportunity to use your upper body strength to an advantage. If you need more leverage on remounting the tire bead place a short piece of pipe as needed with a diameter just big enough to fit over the end of the tire bead mounting tool. Also having a good smooth end tip tire tool would be nice to have as needed. The smooth end is to reduce the chance of cutting the bead &/or inner tube. I purchased this tool at the local Northern Tool store.

This item worked GREAT as a replacement for my 2002 C32 AMG Mercedes Benz key fob.  I was a little bit dismayed that it was going to cost me $250 for a new one, as the dealer will NOT program a new one for you if you order it online.  This was a great solution because it uses your existing "guts" and just replaces the outside part.  The installation was simple, but will require a bit of patience and a little ingenuity.Getting the old card out unscathed is a little challenging, but I used a small metal hook (actually a travel size tooth picking tool) to get through the little holes on the end of the card and GENTLY pulled it out.  After a little bit of working it back and forth I was able to remove the piece completely intact.  I was impressed because I usually end up breaking stuff like this when I try to work on it.  I figured I had nothing to lose, however, as my original one was pretty messed up and all cracked.The only issue that I have with this remote is that the "Panic" word has already scraped off, but I don't believe that is any different than the original in that respect.  It's a big red button, if I can't figure that out in a panic, then I shouldn't be using it.  Everything else about this product worked perfectly.  I would have given it 4.5 stars because of the panic button wearing off so quickly, but again it is just like the original in that respect.  The buttons are a little more stiff than the original, but I think that will change over time.I would LOVE to see a version with the back part, since you have to use the original and I do have another remote where the back is cracked a little, but perhaps this is something they can work on in the future?  Keep that in mind, seller. :-D

Junk, super thin tin body, like thick tin foil?  The welds are like a 6th grader did them (see pic). A corner was dented (see pic). The lock was cheap and weak. I'm pretty sure I could pry this open with my bare hands, or a butter knife. The cheap plastic logo sign fell off when I took it out of the box. I returned it, as this POS isn't worth 5 bucks, let alone over $200???

I'm surprised and how similar these fog lights are to the original Toyota design. The only thing noticeably different is are the rubber plugs in back that go over the vent holes. For that, I just took the old ones off the Toyota originals and they fit perfectly on the holes of the new ones. The only notable issue is the clip mount connector tabs behind the pointed inner side of the light don't expand like the Toyota ones so they were unusable. I had to unscrew it all together and just use some wide washers from Home Depot to go over the square mount hole in the bumper using the same screws.The fact that you get two lights for the price of one used one on Ebay is also interesting.

The available wire on each end is far shorter than in the photo.The red "cap" seen on the male side of the plug separates easily from the surround.  This may not be an issue for most that use this plug as a permanent plug where you plug it in and never disconnect it.  In my application this plug is to be used several times, with the red section separating it will cause an issue.

These are not the lights for you, if you need to see.  Bright?  Yes.....when you are looking at them.  That is the nature of an LED light, it looks brighter.  But this little light will not "throw" much.  Read the description  It says 80 lumen.2835 SMD have a draw of 0.2 watt, and put out between 14-25 lumen.For me, it was just good enough to illuminate my license plates.  In my state, rear license plates must be lit.  However, the law does not say how bright the light has to be, or provide for any scientific method for a police officer to measure the light with.  So yes, I have lights on my license plate....barely!  Let's not make it any easier for a cop to read your plates.  Use these as a low light, legal option.On one of my cars, these fit perfectly into the corner marker lights.  Essentially, a light bulb behind a yellow lens.  It allows other vehicles to see me in low light conditions and on rainy days.  Not meant to "throw" any light onto the road, but someone will know the position of my vehicle as they look in my direction.  A perfect placement for this lamp, because LED are very bright when you're looking at them.

I bought used Audi S4 calipers with carriers to upgrade the size of my Rotors on my Audi A4.  Cleaning with brake cleaner alone won't get the job done on dirty calipers.  Dirt and Crud was caked on so I used cleaners in this order:  Spent over an hour cleaning each caliper.- Gunk Heavy Duty Engine Cleaner - to get the bulky dirt and grease off - water flush.- Brake cleaner with Scotch Bright to clean and scuff the original black paint.- 409 cleaner and Scotch Bright to continue scuffing and final oil residue removal - water flush.  (409 is a known paint-prep cleaner)VHT Red is translucent - Must use a light paint or primer first.My local store didn't have the primer so I bought one can of silver.  The VHT Red paint is pretty translucent so painting black rotors would end up a very dark red.  The silver undercoat allowed 2 red coats to be bright red.  I tested Red straight over Black . . not good.VERY IMPORTANT:  If you are installing the calipers after you paint them, you have to cure the paint first. Otherwise brake fluid will ruin the paint while you are attaching the brake lines.I baked the calipers for 2 hours at 250 degrees in my Gas BBQ.  My BBQ has 3 burners.  I turned the left burner on medium then put a 24" wide aluminum disposable baking pan - upside down- over the entire width of the grill.  Then put the calipers on the opposite end from the lit-burner. I separated the caliper from the aluminum pan with a magazine to avoid the hot spot of direct contact.  Used a cooking thermometer to set the burner to maintain 250 degrees at the location of the caliper in the grill.My results are perfect - Well be on the track this weekend for 2 days. Ill see if the paint can handle the heat and report the results.

I am an avid crafter and diyer and i picked this roll of vinyl up for that purpose. It is fairly large for the purpose of small crafts so it lends itself to an endless number of applications. It is fairly durable as far as vinyl goes and is easy to cut, apply and smooth out any air bubbles. I can easily say that I have zero qualms with this product and would buy it again.I tried to provide as many photos of the details as I could because honestly when I look at reviews I first go to the photos to see the real life image of the item as I have found sometimes the stock photos can misrepresent what you're buying.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. It is also important to note that I did not receive any kind of compensation for my review and I do not have any connection or relationship to the seller. I rely heavily on product reviews when making a large majority of my purchases thats why my written opinion is always honest and unbiased whether I recieve a product at a discount or pay full price.

this product doesn't live up to its claims. We applied it in the cool of the evening and it was very thin and runny as seen in the photos that I posted. I used high quality products and this one is lesser of others that I have tried. It does give you a temporary shine. It does dull easily and after a day or so.I can't attest to the long term salvation of the tires with the use of this product since I am only sampling this one bottle and I probably won't use it again.My photos below will  speak for themselves.I received this product free since I am a nation wide product tester and my testimony is true and unbiased.

So I measured this to ensure the proper fit before ordering for my 2018 Ram 1500 Sport. I ended up getting the 5.8 bed size. This was not that heavy to lift onto the truck bed rails once out of the box. Line up the sides, tighten the rear clamps, keep following the instructions, and its on. Being a jet engine mechanic, most instructions that come with most truck parts suck, but these weren't actually too bad for anyone to follow! Plus, this was a very easy install! It only took me about 15-20 minutes from opening the box to clean up. So far, its solid and I don't see any issues. Still need to do a test drive. If any issues Im sure Ill do an update!*Update...no noise and its definitely on! Test drive went great!

This net has expanded the uses of my motorcycle by 10X. Before things like extra luggage or a spear helmet could only go in a backback(weight on my shoulders) or on a saddlebag(extra $) but this net was a great alternative, not to mention it's stylish and functional. I can't think of any reason to not give this product 5 stars.  The clips are durable, the net is also durable and super stretchy. Great product, fair price, so what are you waiting for?

The only thing that stopped me from giving 5 stars is that the grips are plastic. Previous reviews seem to indicate that they used to be metal. I'm a bit worried about the durability.However, installation was very quick and easy, and I love them. First ride of about 50 miles, and they are comfortable with no fatigue.As they fit very snug, I did not glue the clutch grip. It is pretty tight, and I will monitor to see if I need to glue later.

Using this on my 1998 Grand Cherokee 5.9 Limited. After a second try, I've given up. It does not fit vehicle properly.Problem 1: The mount point is right and the overall shape and function matches the OE part. However, the arm is not shaped properly, resulting in a wiper blade that does not park against the hatch like it is supposed to as well as making it impossible to open the hatch glass without pushing down on the blade to move it out of the way.Problem 2: The joint, where the entirety of the arm is affixed to the bracket that bolts to the wiper motor, has play in it. It can wiggle, thus indicating a problem with how that joint is made. The OE part does not have any play AT ALL.Amazon replaced my first part after I broke it trying to mend these issues. The second part, which I am returning for a refund, was even worse. I typically have good luck with Dorman parts, but this one is just a mess.TL;DR Look elsewhere.The pictures I've uploaded compare the OE arm to the Dorman arm.

Almost a Cigar, close to perfect!It didn't include a factory style washer as in my OEM supports, re-used them... no instructions, being a printer wish you had them on paper and in the packaging, but excellent product!  Dont need to help my hatch lift up any longer!Photo shows the Washer which make it look almost OEM. There is also a white plastic retainer that keeps the washer secure on the bolt, could discard them.

It powers up, lights up the bulbs, so I guess it's ok there, but it doesn't seem to provide enough power to provide the bulb's true color. I've made my tests to confirm it's not a bulb issue, but a ballast issue.bottom line: stay away from any brand of slim ballast (until technology improves)

These are the only brackets that work with JK/JKU. I've tried several different brands and even spoke with people at a 4x4 store and they told me Rough Country is the only bracket that will work on my Jeep and they were right!

Product is good but Amazon packaging is very poor.  They threw the can in a huge box with 1 air bag.  The can was dented so badly that the cover almost came off.  Amazon better start addressing their packaging or they will soon be losing a lot of business!Self-leveling paint.  The black is high gloss and the second coat dried to a nice smooth finish.  I used it on the rotor hubs first and will be painting the calipers too.  I bought two cans thinking I would need it to do the 4 rotors and calipers but one can would have been more than enough.  I cleaned the new rotors with brake cleaner/degreaser.  I did not use primer.  Put on one thin coat and let set overnight.  Applied the second coat.  Picture shows the result.  Nice product.

Is a decent steering stabilizer, pretty much the same size as OEM, Nothing spectacular. My biggest disappointment was that the new post does not fit into the drag link so I had to punch out the metal sleeve on the old stabilizer and put it in the new one along with all the old hardware. I have a '00 XJ Sport, no lift. Besides that though, just your average steering stabilizer. Worth replacing the stock one for the price if you are still rocking the original like I was. (There was ZERO fluid left in mine)

How Bright Are They?How Many Lumen?What Size Hole To Drill?Which AWG wire?Photos?  Trick photography.  Photo editing software.  You see what they want you to see.When these turn on, they are very bright to look at.  That is the nature of any LED.  Now, the real question is , what will this do?  Lamp will give good illumination for about 10' or possibly 3 meters.  In very dark areas with no light source, such as a closet without windows, this works best.  Great under a jungle canopy at night.  No reflector.  No throw.  Three LED lights mounted on the inside.  Item description does not describe the actual LED module used.These will not throw enough to be driving lights or fog lights.  Great for parking lights, indicator lights, reverse camera assist lamps, and decent as secondary signals.Be ready for 24 gauge aluminum wire.  Lamps will heat up so install with discretion.  The hole could be about 3/8"  Use washers, lock washers, and silicone for your installation.  Multiple lamps could be wired in tandem, as opposed to in series.  Red to red.  Black to black.  Not red to black.  Using 2.1*5.5mm connectors makes installations a breeze.  Install these onto the underbody of your off-road vehicle for night crawling.  Use a larger diameter washer between the light head and the nut, drill a 23mm hole into your headlamp housing, insert lighthead into headlamp housing, then affix with Liquid Nails&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Liquid-Nails-LN950-10-Ounce-Ultra-Duty-PolyAdhesive/dp/B000BO9PA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Liquid Nails LN950 10-Ounce Ultra Duty PolyAdhesive</a>&nbsp;and wire lamps with an LED flasher&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CEC-Industries-EF30AL-Electronic-Wig-Wag-Alternating-Flasher-Relay-LED-Compatible-3-Ground-Wire-Prongs-12-Volts/dp/B00JXLHMTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CEC Industries EF30AL Electronic Wig-Wag Alternating Flasher Relay, LED Compatible, 3 + Ground Wire Prongs, 12 Volts</a>&nbsp;.........instant auxiliary warning lights.

All I can say is... WOW. After one full day of use, this is by far the best automotive air freshener I ever tried (squash). The scent is pretty strong and fills your car up quick (including the trunk!) even when the vents are completely shut, which I don't mind. The little casing that came with it looks nice as well. Hopefully it will last me a few weeks in this hot Vegas weather. Beats spending $5-$6 every week for a Yankee Candle 3pk if that will be the case.

Everything went on as expected and this thing engages STRONG. Definitely happy with the purchase.This thing looks good, comes with new hardware, works very well. As I highlight my negative encounters, it is important to note each could be very specific to my vehicle. The ground cable for the solenoid made it incredibly hard to get my hand bent around for the tiny nuts. (See last image) I reused the hardware from the original for ease, because there was no separate washer. Also, the holes for the mounting bolts were just a touch tight, still very much acceptable. Though if you did not fit check first, you may think your cross threading.Final thought; If this will fit you car, buy it.

Installed the kit today.  Super easy except rear blocks.  Had to drill hole out to a larger size so spring bolt could fit inside.  I removed the factory block and installed the lift block instead.  Use the factory U-bolts as the provided bolts will be to long.  This will create a level stance and retain factory shocks.  Still would replace later.  This kit allows 33's but need a body lift to squeeze 35's or fiberwerx fenders.

I've tried many different wheel cleaners before and this one is really great.  I was excited to try this on my wheels today even though it was raining lol. I haven't cleaned my wheels in at least a month and I'm happy to say that this wheel cleaner is the best one I've used so far.  I might have used a bit more than I needed but no harm. Do use a wheel brush though if you have more than ordinary dirt and dust build up. No wheel cleaner can get rid of brake dust alone not even the really expensive ones. Good job carguys.

I love the sound and performance I received from the K&N typhoon SRI on my r18. Gas mileage will improve, but out of human nature after installing you will wanna push the gas for sound. But once you get over it should improve mpg by 2-3 depending on your driving habits I love K&N I had a CAI on my previous car, never had any issues. Will always use in all my future cars. Installing is fun, patience is key. gloves is recommended could be a tight squeeze while installing, cut my hands. Enjoy the sound, and improved mpg!!!

I bought this LED light in 43mm. because my car's owners manual says so. BUT there's a small detail, in original's incandescent bulb, the contact tips are slightly shorter and pointed than this LED light. So, when i tried to installed, barely fits inside the contacts, actually they bend outwards to accepts the LED. And then, once installed WOW, it's REALLY bright, i see it as a "cool white" light. To brighter for a small/medium car. Curiously, this 43mm fits exactly in the glove compartment light's socket.Had to order his small 38mm little brother, in order to change it, fits but a little bit flimsy, may be you need to bend one contact to secure the led and VOILA, it's bright enough to see perfectly clear.

These WILL fit your Harley with about 5 minutes of work. I bought a custom Harley trike with a hard mounted EVO motor.  Even with all the  "good vibrations" I get from the engine these mirrors do not vibrate a bit.  They are plenty large for a full rear view.  They hold their settings very well.  They don't have a lot of adjustment so you will need to get most of your setting from the way you position the supports to the hand grip controls. The right mirror needed a little filing to clear the brake reservoir. This is no big deal.  I took the biggest part of it off with a bench grinder then went to a file then to 400 grit wet sandpaper.  I got it glassy smooth and dabbed a little bright silver automotive touch-up paint on the raw spot.  The raw spot rides against the reservoir so it is not visible.  All-in-all I can't be happier with these mirrors.

Im so disappointed with this purchase considering the great reviews/rated stars.  I bought this on 1/12/2017, and its been over a year now, living in New England with the cold and wet snow... this license plate started showing signs of corrosion within the first 4-5 months.  Now look at it (see photo).  It looked pretty solid and felt like it was well made when I first got it.  I would suggest reading reviews before making this purchase.UPDATE 5/3/18:  Waste of money after a year.  Signs of rust and corrosion all of over them.  See photos for (2) of the plates purchased back in January 2017.  I do NOT recommend these if you live in cold/humid/rainy climates, or they will not last long.

For all those who buy this "gold" visor. Here is an actual picture of the color. It's more smoke than anything with barely a gold tint. I love it though and it came in real Scorpion packaging. Great buy for $18. The second picture is through the visor looking at a wall at my desk. The wall is gray. You can just barely detect a yellowish hue. I think this will be good for night riding.

This is a lifesaver if you have a suspension where the strut is held in by a carrier collar on the bottom. I've tried this on a 5 series BMW and it works but it could be 1mm wider to spread it out just a bit more to a point where the collar could slide out easier. I had some spare lug bolts sitting around so I took a grinder to it and made my own version of the tool which I did allow the extra 1mm width and also slightly tapered the corners so I could twist it easier. It worked even better for my application and only took 5 min to make with my cut off tool. Also the bolt is grade 8 or higher so I don't have to worry about it twisting or breaking off.

These work great.  I've used them multiple times now while working on the exhaust and also the intercooler pipes on my car.  I have a 2015 VW GTI, which weighs around 3000lbs.  Now, would I be using these on a huge, heavy truck or SUV?  Probably not!  But for my 3000lb car, they do their job.  They stop the car from rolling, do not slide, and do not crush/break.

They are not wind proof or water proof...that is for sure. These are a good-weather/summer riding shoe. Good support. The pull loop in the back broke off the first time I tried to use it to get the boot on. Not a huge deal, but the loop isn't very practical, and I think is there for looks.For riding they feel good. I would not recommend them if you are going to wear them and walk around for awhile.7-7-2018 update: I bought these in February. I have been wearing them about 4 days a week, riding to and from work, and wearing them throughout the day at work. (I do a lot of sitting, so it isn't too bad.).  The metal loops look and appear tough, but the they seem to shred the shoelaces. Yesterday the exterior of the laces broke, leaving only the core of the lace. Today I replaced them with paracord. Should last a little longer.While I had the laces off, I saw that the threads were starting to come off where the tongue meets the boot. I now wonder how long before the tongue breaks off.The boot may last me a season at this pace.

This is a great light bar.  I'm very pleased with the seller as well as the product.  Not only is the quality great so is the light it produces.  This light bar is very bright.  We actually have another one (the one on the bottom that is a tad smaller and a curved bar as shown in the photo)  This seller keeps in quick contact.  My hubby loves LED light bars and we also have the set of 4" LED lights from this seller on our golf cart.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who does woods riding, hunting, late night drives, car shows, etc.I received this product free in exchange for my thoughts, experiences, and honest written review.

All parts included.  Package contains all the fittings you will need to make this work.  The included relay, however, was defective upon arrival. The relay's pin was soldered in at the wrong angle at it's base so it won't plug into the jack no matter how creative you get. I will just go to my local auto parts store to replace the relay.  Too much hassle to return to seller for a cheap $25 wiring harness. I would not recommend this simply because receiving working, functional components may be a crap-shoot. Poor quality control. Instructions were simple and clear. Or at least good enough to figure it out.

I bought these as a cheap alternative for my dual sport motorcycle. Finding reasonably priced accessories can be tricky. I did not apply the velcro to my tank but I did sew on a strap with a buckle connector to use on the bottom front of the bags to help keep them secure. I used them on a motorcycle camping trip last week and they worked just fine. Very happy with the purchase!

The bag appears well built, but not necessarily worth the price.  I would like to see an incorporated molded hard bottom to prevent collapsing when tightened down onto a rear rack that might be a little smaller than the bag.  I currently have lost some internal volume from the bottom encroaching inward.  It's not a huge deal, but it would make a difference for my application.

Very bright lights, I purchased these as reverse lights for my dads 2013 Dodge Ram 1500 because the cheap ones I originally had in there started to get dim and turn an off white blue color. These are crisp and very bright white. I originally didn't know which ones to purchase the 800 lumen or 1000 lumen so I contacted the company which has EXCELLENT customer service and they guided me toward these because of the design and scattered output along with high lumens.

I used these today to mix some fiberglass resin and the cups worked great. They are about the right thickness overall. One of the main things I was concerned about was weather they would hold up to resin and especially acetone. It did with flying colors.  I attached a picture to show two different cups side by side. If you look at the ABN cups the numbers are completely perfect even after rubbing them with acetone 4 times longer than the cup from my local auto paint supply store that is showing the numbers completely missing where I rubbed it for about 5-7 seconds. I think these cups should hold up to pretty much any thing.

I purchased this item awhile back and it has worked out great.  However, I don't know if the adhesive cannot take the daily push of an SUB, but the block keeps slowly pushing back.  Maybe this is designed for smaller cars, as my wife's Charger's block has not moved yet.

So is standard with most aftermarket downpipes you typically need a spacer to avoid getting a check engine light when you run it without a tune. Many spacers are hit or miss and require some trial and error to get perfect. This is definitely a hit. The space has three adapters you could also run it without an adapter so there really are four different settings which allow for some great flexibility. Additionally the body and design of the spacer is very robust and the shape allows it to fit in space when others might not. Buy with confidence.

Bought these for my 04 VTX1300C. They indeed look better than the stock switch boxes. Yes, these are covers only but it does look nice. As stated by another reviewer: The left cover is not as nice and thought out as the right. Not sure why but lacks in a couple of areas. (See photo) If you're installing these and you also have Kuryakyn's Clutch Perch and Front Brake covers you might have to readjust their position using the 2 screws; losen and slide them to accommodate these switch boxes. Would I purchase these again? Yes. I'd still recommend them.

Something that I really wanted in a liner was something with a non-porous, thick, durable construction for the heavy and sharp tools going into my tool box.  I like the texture and color of this stuff.  Easy to cut through, but a little difficult to keep a consistent straight cut.  I kept finding myself having to trim it up after my measurements because for one, the material tends to stretch and expand a bit when you're cutting it (though I suppose i'm not the most dexterous person) and secondly like others have mentioned, the cutting from the manufacturer isn't 16" all the way across.  Some points were 16" and at others it could scale to 16 1/2.  Not a big deal for my project being that I only need 16" and essentially I have more material to work with, but it's still a pain when you have to keep trimming it up.  I'd give a 6 out of 10 for grip on the bottom side.Overall I'm satisfied with the outcome.  My order came with 2 large and 2 small stickers, along with a jegs brochure, too.

This fit on this kit is ok. There is only one u-bolt to fasten the lower mount to the leaf spring pack.  This results in a creaking sound over almost any moderate sized bump. Frustrating to say the least.  I ended up modifying the mount and adding a 2nd u-bolt from a helper spring set up to secure the mount. This solved the creaking problem.In less than a year one of the bags developed a leak and would not hold air for more than 24 hours.Long story short, Ill be installing my 5th replacement air bag ($70.00) this weekend. The lifetime warranty is a joke,Do yourself a favor and buy the Firestone system instead.

Title says it all!!Tonight I finished installing my 2" Rough Country leveling kit that I got off of Amazon for $66 with shipping. Must I say after a 30 minute drive home IM PLEASED... EXTREMELY PLEASED..I love my truck too much to mess something up and didn't wanna spend the money for professionals to do it but I figured what the heck, 100% bolt on no special tools required but 1 wrench (15mm), 2 deep sockets (15mm & 18mm) , a crescent wrench, and a 7/32 allen wrench. Lets proceed.First off the kit comes with 2 spacers, 4 bolts, 8 washers, 4 nuts, instructions, rough country advertising sticker, and a yellow rough country warning sticker to put either on the inside of the door alongside the other factory spec sticker(s), in the glove box, or in the engine compartment; choice is yours but its bright and notifies anyone working on the truck or future owner that there is a modification.Now on to my clarifications for ease of installment. I followed the youtube video "2010 Rough Country Leveling Kit Install" TO THE TEE! However when trying to pry the strut up there was an extreme amount of pressure and it just felt as though someone was gonna get hurt. Didnt feel normal. Well after about an hour of trying to watch every moving part while prying and also trying to observe what is happening as well as "what needs to happen" ..FINALLY WE SPOTTED THE PROBLEM... we noticed one important step missing in the video instructions that would make the install go from 1.5 hours to 20 minutes tops GUARANTEED,  WHICH IS JUST OUR OPINION. But if somehow you were able to get it by watching the video in this post and following those steps then most likely your here reading this because you broke something or messed something up and want to know of that easier way you could have done it.In the video they stated loosening and leaving the sway bar bolt loose. For us this was humanly impossible to pry the strut far enough away from the lower control arm to slip the spacer in safely. We simply unscrewed the top nut and removed it completely from the sway bar but left the bolt in place. Giving you MUCH more room to move strut up and down. Next we easily picked the strut up away from the control arm and placed the spacer in place and wiggled the pry bar back and forth to align holes to accept bolts. We used a small vertical hydraulic jack to crank the lower control arm up to allow bolt for sway bar to protrude through enough for nut to catch.Your also going to need the 7/32 allen to keep the ball joint from spinning when tightening your control arm nut. Also FYI the other side took us 12 minutes TIMED!!! Trust me just just remove the to nut completely from the sway bar. Now that we are finished and see the bigger picture of what we needed to do I consider this install a very very simple install probably a 2 or 3 out of 5 on a 10 scale of difficulty.Going check alignment first thing in the morning hope you all find this post helpful. I don't ever post on anything but figured my two cents may save someone an hour of daylight. PLEASE GIVE THUMBS UP IF THIS REVIEW HELPED IN ANY WAY! Thanks God bless.Update 4/5/2017: Since I first wrote this article, I have since installed this kit on 3 separate trucks that I've  owned: 2011 Chevrolet Silverado LT 2WD, 2011 GMC Yukon SLT 2WD, and 2008 GMC Sierra SLE. All were equally easy and came out nice! Rough Country is the way to go! Dont settle for anything less!! Other brands have packaging issues, broken parts, missing pieces, uneven bolts, misthreaded bolts, unthreaded bolts, etc...

I bought these to use on my 2006 Wrangler Unlimited when the doors are off.  They mount in the upper door hinge nicely.  No whistling, minimal vibrations.  Passenger side view is not obstructed at all.  I added a shaft collar at the bend so the bend wasn't digging into my hinge bushing and used a nylon washer on the bottom to keep from scratching up the bottom of the hinge.  I also replaced the nuts with M8 x 1.25 nylon lock nuts.  Very happy with them.

Our Sun Shade by OutBack was mailed with several other items I ordered in a brown card board box and was delivered to my front door by UPS.  This sun shade comes in a plastic seal bag with a hole on the top to hang on a hook if in a retail environment.  This kit comes with two (2) side window shades that magically clings to all car windows.  That's right just unfold and stick to the window and it clings to the window, no suction cups.  These window shades BLOCK the heat - but not your view.  To help ensure they work at an optimum follow these instructions: Simply wipe clean window with paper towel; Place Outback Shade Magic Cling in place with smooth side to window; Smooth your hand over shade to press firmly to window.  These window shade measures 19" (48cm) x 12" (30cm).  These are very nice and my grandson loves them, no more sun in his face and heating him up like a burger on a grill! LOL!I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own. I work very hard trying to write insightful and thoughtful reviews for each item. My hope is that these reviews are helpful to others.

Well worth the money! Test them before you wire them! I have a 06 2500hd crew cab long box (8foot) and the wire was enough.You will however need extra wire from the battery to the switch.Just installed, no time on them yet but I like what I see

2011 JEEP WRANGLER SPORTI love my red jeep but the grill is just to red. I was looking for something to break up allthe red but i hate chrome so the next logical color was black, seeing how much of the trim ona jeep is black so it seemed like the perfect fit.  The install was simple and the fit andfinish was great.  highly recommend.

I really like this clock.  It installed easily, looks great!  However, it is NOT waterproof. Rode to work in storm, the face is half full of water sloshing around.  It is still running, so I took it all apart to clean, oil, and dry.  Hopefully it will not quit.  Now I know where to install the battery and adjust the time!

5/12/16I have three of these.  One mounted as a backup light on my truck and the other two as backup lights on my trailer.  One on the truck held up a few weeks then  the LEDs went out.  One of the two on the trailer got water in it within days of just sitting in the driveway (not I did not submerge it, or even drive with it at all and it was right-side up).  I was able to take the two on the trailer apart (removed the clear lens) and silicone it back on.  So far no water in them.  Note that you will do some damage to the finish when trying out the lens to remove it.but not too bad if you are careful.Build quality LOOKS good and they are quite heavy and feel sturdy.  At 6500k they are quite bluish  bright white in color as you would expect from 6500kpersonally I don't see that as a selling point.If you get them at the right price then it may be worth the aggravation to seal them up..but that still does not explain only 3 out of 6 LEDS working on the one that has not shown signs of water in it.UPDATE 6/10/17One of the ones on the trailer has water in it again, despite silicone sealing the lenses on!  Only thing i can think of is infiltration where the wire goes in.  Took the lens off and dried it thoroughly.  Siliconed lens back on and did the best i could to seal the wire entry.  Lets see what happens....

just bought one from killer motorsports  an online dropshipping company who sends them from the tao tao distribution center in texas.  i cant complain i paid 1199 which included the shipping.  very had to get started the first time because it was cold.  i took it for a two hour ride down limestone and dirt atv paths.  did some doughnuts which was really fun.  i need to get rear wheel spacers because the front tires are wider and it felt like it was going to roll on sharp turns.  chain tensioner fell apart.  the roller piece seems to slip over the bearing.  lucky for me it happened in the yard and not in the middle of no where.  it was missing a bolt on the chain adjustment so i bought another one from the ace hardware.  at first had a real hard time shifting now its gotten easier but still occasionally doesnt shift when i want it to.  got it up to 40-50mph which was fast enough for me.  id like to make a trailer hitch for it but i have no ideas. if i get two or three years out of it then ive gotten my moneys worth out of it.  brakes were damaged when i got it i sent in a claim and ive yet to hear from.

OMG, thats all I have to say about this exhaust system. The parts are made from high quality materials, very precise fittings. I don't have any fuel control system Installed and the bike is running fine like advertised. It makes a lot of popping sound when you change gear and decelerate. But overall, its a good buy and Im very happy.

Perfect fit. Quality all looks good, very solid piece and it installed perfectly. No alignment issues or anything. So far so good, my broken up-pipes are fixed and this y-pipe is working exactly as it should. EASILY worth the cost savings so far. New bolts and the only gasket in the up-pipe system, are included Will try to update later, once I have more miles on it, good or bad.In the photo I added, I had already wrapped the y-pipe in&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/DEI-010127-2-34-Titanium-Exhaust-Header-Wrap-50/dp/B002R4U72I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">DEI 010127 2" Titanium Exhaust/ Header Wrap - 50'</a>, but you get the idea. And this is only the y-pipe, the other pipe in the upper right corner is not in this kit.

Great product! Used these to replace my worn and floating oem bump stops on my 2004 Chevy Colorado z71 4x4.... They were a tight fit but I lubed them and tapped them in with mallet then installed nut they provided with a grade 8 washer to add some rigity! I also bought the sway bar bushings with grease fittings from same brand.

AWESOME HELMET STRAP! Took all of 10 min, NO SEWING! The only thing I had to do with my helmet strap is cut off the snap on the end of the long strap on the other side of the D rings and melt the end. See pictures! Honestly I cannot figure out what the problem is after reading some of the reviews.You snap the part with the red pull ribbon around your existing D rings, run the other strap through the plastic piece then through the part that looks like a saw blade and back through the plastic piece. I think you will get the idea when you see the pictures.

I purchased these bulbs to replace the stock map lights in my Accord.  I had tried a couple of different LED's but they were too long and I couldn't get the cover back on.  These are perfect as they are super low profile.  Smaller than the stock bulbs even.  They were very easy to install, but you may have to flip them around to get them to light up if they don't work the first time.  They are much brighter than the stock bulbs and have a nice pure white color to them.

So, my now ex was at Home Depot and texted me asking if I needed anything, I texted " Can of Seafoam ". So she shows the store clerk my text. She brings me home a can of foam for spraying into cracks ..Okay, so unfortunately the store clerk does not have a clue to the many beneficial uses of Seafoam. I use it on motorcycles, atvs and small engines when the carburetors are having issue. 90% of the time, the Seafoam will be effective and rebuild will not be necessary.On atv's and motorcycles, I pour a can of Seafoam into the gas tank and run the engine for 15-20 minutes. I then remove the air filter and place my hand over the intake while holding the throttle wide open. You may see fuel and fire come out the exhaust, no worries. This method will usually clean any trash or restriction in the low and high idle jets. Or you can do the following, on small engines drain the old fuel and fuel bowl, refill with fresh fuel and add seafoam. Pull the spark plug and turn engine over until fuel is present at plug opening. Install spark plug and let set for several hours prior to starting.Use in vehicle fuel tanks regularly to prevent any sludge buildup, preventing fuel pump screen blockage and extending the life of the fuel pump. Occasionally, I will pour Seafoam into the vacuum line going to the throttle body. No doubt Seafoam works, as you will see a noticeable difference in performance after usage. The only drawback to using on older vehicles is that it will clean the gunk out of them and you will be having to change fuel filters as it will clog them up

When I first opened the box, I thought it was wasn't going to work. I was so wrong! This thing is such a hoot!It does work, and it works really well. So well, in fact that it gave me quite the spook when I tried it the first time. Let me back up though and at least explain how I hooked it up. It comes with two short wires, (red and black) that are about 16-18 gauge. (That is part of the reason I didn't think it was going to work.) There are no instructions, so if you don't know what you are doing, find someone who does.I wanted to make mine removeable, since I also have other vehicles I want to use it on. I ended up using butt connectors and connecting it to small battery clamps that clip directly to the posts on the battery. Red is positive, black is negative. Please don't mix these up. Bad things can happen!The microphone and speaker are connected with a telephone-type connector. If you were to run it through the firewall, the connector is pretty small, so if you drill a hole (Make sure you know where you are drilling!), it doesnt need to be huge. There are much better adapters that they could have used to connect the microphone and the speaker, but it works the way it is. If you have a large or deep engine bay, you will also need to extend the wire that goes from the horn to the connector.I cannot believe how loud it is. I pressed one of the buttons while still in the garage and I not only almost lost complete control of my bladder, but also possibly gave my neighbor (who isn't known for obeying the law) a heart attack, since it was one of the sirens that I pressed.Oops! Its a good thing I live in the country!There is also a microphone holder that comes with it so you can mount it to the dash, but since mine is movable, I didn't mount it.Other tips I can include are:I use the speaker button to cancel out the horns.Each of the buttons sound different, but they aren't all labeled.The microphone isn't nearly as loud as the sirens and horns, but it still gets anyones attention.The video that I will have uploaded has all of the sirens played quickly in succession, so the video isn't super long. I started with the horn in the upper left.Please note: This review was written completely of my own volition. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

I just finished the installation and initial test of this gauge. The fit and finish is first-class and installation was a breeze (excluding the mandatory gymnastics that are required for working under any vehicle's dash). The gauge's face screens are razor sharp and the color choices coupled with the standard brightness levels yield a very readable display.This gauge offers the option of dimming the display when the headlights are on, but I don't plan to leverage the feature as the the light level is not offensive. This means it might even be too subdued for some users, as I always turn my dash illumination down very low as I find bright dash lighting to be distracting. I think the defining factor here is that only the necessary information is actually lit, as opposed to many vehicles where EVERYTHING glows, turning the gauge cluster into a fireworks display.The gauge is very readable and has the wonderful startup sweep, which I always find captivating (don't judge me!).The accuracy seems reasonable, but I have no baseline, so you'll have to trust me. But, rest assured that temperature measurement at the accuracy required in an automobile is NOT rocket science and even the Chinese can probably get the job done within reasonable tolerances. The variable here is whether or not the instrument endures.Initial impression? I very much like the product and will purchase more Glowshift bits as my truck project moves forward.

Really nice product. Great communication from seller - they do there best to insure satisfaction. These lights look awesome - super bright and lots of color choices and effect options. My picture doesn't do them justice. I have two bikes and installed them on both. I did buy the LYLLA Extension Cable Wire Cord Set 30cm/60cm/90cm and 1-to-10 Splitter and LYLLA 4 Pcs 90cm Extension Cable Wire Cord Set so I'd have plenty of installation options. Also, I put these on a switch to insure they would not use any power when I'm parked.

I got them installed today and these things look awesome! I only wish I bought them 1/2 inch wider. Took a while to ship, but got them the next day once they finally pulled the order.  Still got the package on time, barely. Fit my car perfectly, 2003 BMW 530i. I did my homework to make sure I wouldn't need adapters or spacers, so no extra stuff to go wrong and they bolted right on my car. Two thumbs up! Pictures and the real product match. No complaints.

Used to get a little extra light while reversing in my 2016 Tacoma Off-Road. The results were not as dramatic as I thought they would be from the product photo but I believe my reverse lights were already pretty bright. In the attached pictures you can see an increase is Illuminated area and also the camera adjusts for brightness so the difference may seem even smaller you can tell how much whiter the light is by how the surrounding lights look even more amber. In the attached pictures the bottom half shows the truck with the new lights in it. The difference is not huge but for $20 and a super simple plug and play I am happy with it. Will update the review with durability informations as my usage continues. Let me know if you have any questions and if this was helpful.

I used this on my 19 foot 1977 SeaRay. The boat was chalky and the gel coat had no reflection whatsoever and would rub off on your hand. With a 100% wool pad (very important) on setting #2 on my Milwaukee buffer (its variable speed dial goes to 5) it took me a total of 6 hours over 2 days to buff the entire exterior and interior gel coat surfaces to a very nice shine. Thats pretty quick for as bad as the gel coat was. I have buffed many boats and jet skis but this was the first time using this particular product. This will be my go to compound from now on. On darker surfaces follow up with #45 high gloss polish for a brilliant shine followed by a sealant or wax.

Had this installed on our 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, mounted directly to the frame (no lift). If you can spend the money then this is definitely one of the best bumpers you can get on the market for your Jeep.Pros: To start It comes with 3/4 inch cold pressed steel construction. No one on their right minds will ever want to rear-end you. It has built in tow hooks/points. It has a built in hitch with reinforcement (forged into the frame). It also has some nice stainless steel plating on both sides (the left side says XRC). It has built in reverse lights (LED's) which are of decent strength and adds quite a touch. They are not reverse headlights as some suggested but definitely provide additional visibility.  D-Rings shown in photo were purchased seperately.Cons:There are some plastic siding pieces added for look which cracked upon installation (screws tightened caused them to brake) a call to smittybilt had replacements sent.No other cons to this awesome bumper.

My wife and I recently epoxied our garage floor ourselves, it was a ton of work but worth it! Even the best epoxies will start yellowing where the tires drive over time, leaving yellow tracks in the garage. To combat this, I bought this mat. The pictures were taken just minutes after pulling it from the box an laying it out. Several reviews state they had trouble with the corners not laying flat, using double sided tape, being too thin, ect. I didn't have any of these issues, nor do I think it is too thin for the purpose I purchased it for. As long as you don't try to adjust your steering wheel too much the mat will stay in place. I actually like that it is thin, it makes it easy to handle and lay out to your liking. The rubber backing is nice and seems to have a nice grip on the epoxy. Time will tell how this holds up over winters, but again what I'm really after is protecting the epoxy from direct tire contact. If it holds up I'll purchase another one for the other side of the garage. At that time I'll also update this review.UPDATE: After having the first one all summer, I purchased a second one for the other side of the garage. I thought it did a great job protecting the epoxy finish, as you can see I added a picture with the first mat I purchased pulled up, showing the bare floor. It is true you can power wash the mat out as advertised, I just did this earlier today and it cleaned up nicely. You can tell the difference from the mat I had over the summer as opposed to the one I just bought as the first one has faded a little, not a deal breaker though. The real test will be seeing how these hold up over the winter. I'll post another update in the spring when I clean them out. My recommendation still stands.

I honestly love it, had it for a month now, hasn't dimmed, hasn't fogged inside the lends or burned out, but I did paint it red to try and get the whistle awayUPDATE 5 MONTHS: its been since Christmas since i ordered the light and it is current May the 12, still works great, still not dimmed or faded, holds up great in the rain, still has whistle which is kinda annoying but i drive with loud music so no really complaining much, other than that, great light

2 braces one replaces the plastic support on the passenger side the other goes between the shock towers across the engine. Should improve the cornering and handling. First picture is before starting work, Middle picture compares the plastic support to the new heavy steel one, last picture is with install complete and plastic covers re-installed.  Total work time was 25 minutes.  Used 1/2 inch dogbone to remove the two bolts under the plastic cowl cover (open end or box wrench would also work). Recommend purchasing some thread lock (locktite) for the 4 bolts on the cowl support (good to have before starting the project).  No issues with fitment or hood closing on 2.3l Ecoboost.  Highly Recommend

Wow, this stuff works great, and the package is HUGE! Eight sheets!  My story..Brand new, 2016 Chevy Impala LTZ. TOL, all the toys, including big, wide, 20" wheels and tires. The one we test drove didn't have these big tires, but for some dumb reason, Chevy makes you have them if you order adaptive cruise. So the bigger tires added to the road noise (which wasn't bad with the test drive car) So we set out to install this stuff in the rear of the car. First of all, the seats in these new cars are a real PITA..We also discovered that the outbound seatback cushion in the back are airbag modules so we had to be really careful.  We did the wheel wells, from the rear floor wells back to the bumper. Had just enough to do this big car. I had a couple of small pieces so I put them on the backside of the rear fender. Tapped on it first, sounded like a drum. Even with the fairly small piece I put on, changed the sound to a dull "thud". We only drove the car from home to the Chevy dealer for service but just in that short drive, I could tell the difference. We have a patch of highway that has been scraped so they can refinish. The car makes a roaring sound when driving over it. The sound is more muted, and is a lower frequency if that makes sense. You can still hear it but it seems far less. The material is really easy to work with. Bends and cuts really easy.  In the pictures I have included, you see the rear seat area and the other is the trunk. You don't see a lot of the work because we had already started putting the trim back in.

These appear to be designed way better than OEM. The reason I say that is because these have nylon seals in them to seal the oil and allow a more precise timing advancement. Another thing I noticed is that the locking pin to lock it at base idle is made of nylon with a good spring under it, this will completely prevent the noise that comes from these phasers. Not only do they look built better they appear that they will last a very long time.

I made this mount to bolt my lights to my sandrail.In the top center under the 3/8" bolt head is a 5/8 OD x 3/8 ID rubber grommet, directly under that is a 3/4 x 0.385 x 13/64 Nylon Spacer.On the other side of the light I used a 5/16x1-1/4x1/8 rubber washer which then has a 3/8x1-1/4 steel washer with a 3/8x5/8 rubber grommet and another 1-1/4" steel washer and another nylon spacer and the bolt is screwed onto a 1" Split Ring Hanger.When I have everything in it's final position, I plan to use a thread locking compound to make it stay together.Very bright for my intended use, but that can be a good thing.

Not bad. Easy installation. I installed this on a 2018 Toyota Rav4 Adventure with the extension. The only con is that I have a sun roof and it is noisy is I open it. Probably wouldn't be so bad if I took out the extension but for me that is not really an option because I put costco size x-large chairs in the basket for soccer games / camping etc..Looks great expecially on the Rav4 adventure trim.

Perfect for a FIOS ONT box. Pop out the old batter, switch the connections, and pop in this battery. I've had it installed for a few months now and no problems. Fit is perfect, too. Mine was made in Vietnam, not China. I assume they have multiple factories.

I bought this cushion in the larger size hoping it would fit the console of my 2016 F150....not even close. The elastic band on the back is nowhere near long enough to slip over the console. I can use the cushion but it slips on the console. Not recommended, would not buy again.

Item was shipped quickly.  Looks nice and welds decent.  I had this installed by an exhaust/muffler shop.  The only minor problem was the inlet split when attempting to expand the end with the pipe expander.  Not a problem for the shop, they welded the split, but did mention that steel piping was "cheap" and hence the split when attempting to enlarge the inlet a little.  Sounds really good and throaty on my 1999 Subaru Forester.  Noticed a slight increase in torque.

I skipped on many other spray & liquid waxes because I just can't see them being long lasting. I've tried Chemical Guys Butter Wet Wax, Meguiars Ultimate Wax and a few other randoms. Although easier to remove, I noticed by feel of the paint, and primarily applying them to my bumper and noting how easy bugs were to remove day by day that they just didn't last very long. Apart from this.. I noticed would keep bugs easier to remove for far longer. It's easy to put on.. obviously. And it's not too easy to take off. Nor would I want it to be. If you put wax on and it just wipes right back off, do you really think it's going to last very long? No. I did also order their insulator wax to use with much more ease inbetween wax jobs using this, just seems quicker to use.

Updated:  After two years I decided to redo trim on 99 Jeep Cherokee.  The product finally had worn off due to desert trips (I abuse this truck), sun, multiple washes.  It held up great.  Redid using the leftover product from first application and using foam 1" brush redid entire trim plus other parts.  This stuff is great and will make your tired, ugly trim look new again.Used on 1999 Jeep Cherokee.  Live in southern Cal desert.  Sun bakes things bad here.  My Jeeps trim was ugly grey and almost white especially on bumpers.  Tried the stuff from WM "Black Magic" and believe me there is no magic. So I ordered this product after reading reviews.  In Feb. 2011 I applied product per manufactures instructions  cleaned trim with cleaner applied in shade.  Applied one coat on bumpers, door handles, roof rack, everything.  I did not use the applicator but a 1 inch foam brush. One coat did fair job, after letting dry applied second coat and most all trim turned black.  Then on some areas a third coat and WOW! DEEP BLACK!!  It made trim look almost factory new.  Now it is Sept 2011 and the finish has held up with only minor flaking off in couple area.  Took to carwash and after multiple passes of the spinning brushes it was 95% still intact and looked great.  People who knew my vehicle prior to the application couldn't believe the improvement. Follow directions, use foam brush and apply several coats.  BE CAREFUL to not get on painted surface.  It will come off but have to rub out quickly.  The pre wash liquid seemed to give out quickly but maybe I used up too quickly.  Do yourself a favor and get this stuff.  I submitted pics don't know if they posted.

All the bulbs on all 3 of my Ford F-150s are JDM Astar LED so you could say I've been very happy with their products.  I'm a freelancer who has to drive to remote locations in the middle of nowhere often at night so I'm always looking for "extremely bright" and "brightest" everything.  There are no street lights on the interstate between these little town through the woods and the darkness is so pitch black that the low beams of stock halogen bulbs are often useless.  If you told me that your mousepad or your shoelace were the "brightest" I'd try those too.These bulbs however are not the "brightest" and I seriously doubt they're 80W either.  I have 50W JDM Astar bulbs (in other applications than 9145 fog) that are brighter than these.  The light is crystal white or pure white, whatever you want to call it, but the light parttern is not focused or clean (see attached pic) so if you want distance projection power these are not it.I ended up recycling my 2-year old obsolete JDM Astar 9145 from my older F-f150 which had been sitting on the shelf when I upgraded and they still were way brighter than these.  Those are JDM ASTAR 7th Generation H10 9145 CREE XHP50 All-In-One LED Headlights 6000 Lumens (3000 per bulb) Comes with 5 different color options; 3000K, 4300K but they have a new 8th gen fan-cooled version with Canbus now.I'm currently waiting on the JDM ASTAR 1G 4400 Lumens Extremely Bright H10 9145 9140 High Power LED Bulbs with for DRL or Fog Lights, Xenon White(Brightest Fog lights on the market) to see how bright they are.  If they're not truly "extremely bright" then the search for fogs goes on...JDM ASTAR Extremely Bright Max 80W High Power 9040, 9140, 9145, 9050, 9155, H10 LED Bulbs for DRL or Fog Lights, Xenon White

I bought this carbon Fiber TRD short antenna for my 2015 Tundra, it made a big difference in the look right away. It comes with different screw stick for proper different fittings and so easy to install. My installations from beginning to end took less than 5 minutes and that s because I dropped the screw stick and I couldn't find it.performance, I am note really happy with it, less radio stations work than before so I was really disappointed on this department but to be honest with you I don't really use the radio that much, all my music comes from my phone connected blutooh but I am just letting you know this in case all you use its the radio stations or in case you ever need to emergency broadcasting there will be a big chance that you won't be able to listen to it clearly.Material wise, its pretty well constructed, it won't easily break. The Carbon Fiber looked its only part of the stick, its not the all stick. The TRD lettering its white, it stands out in the stick. Overall,  I had mine for over a few months already and I really liked it. Even thought the frequency doesn't work as I expected for some reason I am still have it installed in my truck and also because a lot of people have said it looks pretty cool.  So if you only car about the looks I will recommend it, its also pretty cheap but if you are looking for a good antenna with good frequency, then I suggest to keep looking. Please note: Seller has provided me with a discount to try and test this carbon Fiber TRD short antenna and this is my truly, unbiased and honest comment about this product after testing for over 3 months.

I really like the concept of this item. The problem is the base is so small in diameter it would not fit in my Ford F-250 cup holders or my Kenworth T680. It is a great idea that comes in handy for eating, snacking while driving, laying change , toll receipts etc while going down the road. I did adapt it to my satisfaction by placing the base in a freezable drink holder. (See pic). I did have to lubricate the tray base to get it to slide into the holder due to the snug fit. I really like this tray but think several size bases should be included to fit various cup holders even if it cost a little more.  UPDATE:  Although my tweaking with the freezable can holder worked well in my Ford, it was a little loose in the KW cup holder. I was able to get a really snug fit by wrapping a elastic Velcro strap around the lower part of the can holder . I pulled the Velcro strap tightly as I wrapped it . (See pic) I then pushed the can holder in firmly. The tray hasn't moved or wobbled over several thousand miles.

UPDATE (Less than a year later):One of the bulbs burned out/stopped working. Changed to one star.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Got the 8k bulbs as a replacement to those awful Phillips brand supplied by a Toyota. Excellent quality, fit like the Phillips bulbs, and the extra brightness cured the lack of light that's normally associated with the stock lights.Let's see how long they last.

Gets the job done. Since my bike is still under warranty, I tend to use OEM stuff for scheduled maintenance. I'm sure there are better filters out there, but have no complaints about the function or build quality of the OEM filter.

I ordered two of these bearings based on previous purchases of quality AC Delco bearings. They are now made in South Korea instead of the USA, but I have purchased quality bearings that were made in South Korea so that's not a deal breaker. These bearings were so bad that I was certain that they were counterfeit. They were packaged poorly, they didn't look the same as the picture, there is a large washer/dust shield on the back that actually rubs on the ABS wire, and when spinning the bearing by hand it is gritty and there are some very rough spots. I'm not sure which would fail first, the ABS wire or the bearing itself. I contacted GM and included almost a dozen pictures to let them know that Amazon was selling counterfeit bearings but they replied and said that it is a genuine AC Delco bearing. I returned these bearings and ordered a set of Timken bearings. The Timkens were also made in South Korea but are much better quality.

These are very nice, high quality and super bright for small lights. I have seen more and more jeeps and trucks with these mounted and they look great. Offroading, camping and just getting into adventure you'll need these for sure. I've been stuck many times and you need all the light you can, you could even mount these facing your truck bed for reverse lights.Overall I'm impressed with the quality and the brightness was just right. I did receive this product as a free sample so that I could provide my best evaluation.I hope my comments and photos will help you make an informed decisioncbenzy

Excellent bar, looks great. It went on in about 30 minutes. The top mount bolt is very difficult to get on and is the reason it took as long as it did. Probably don't even need the top bolt in reality. All the bar is doing is holding a few lights. No modifications needed at all. Just take your time and it slides right around the plastic trim piece.

I ordered these originally thinking I could use them for accent lighting outside.  Not one of my best moments, when they arrived I realized they were more suited to a vehicle.That did not help me much, my husband has started decking out our Black Yukon with neon blue, so he screwed his nose up the green.  Luckily, our neighbor just purchased a new 3 wheeler and was delighted to have them for on his bike.These are easy to install, simply follow the seller directions if you have any problems.  They make great accent lights for inside your vehicle, or for night time color effect such as my neighbor on his 3 wheeler.If you are expecting to have great visibility from this type of lighting you will be disappointed, as I said, they are for accent, flare, to make your eye candy look awesome.  Don't be expecting to apply your lipstick with it on ;-)For their intended purpose they are awesome and certainly make things pop.  Anddddddd of course now I have to order some in the blue to keep my man happy.I received this item complementary in exchange for my review

A very simple install on our trailer. I should have payed a little more attention to what I was ordering. I wanted LED panels and not an LED 1165 bulb. I'll still install them as they may still put out the light I need outside the trailer but by far not as bright as the LED interior lights I already installed. It's hard to rate a lesser product very high when you started with a product that far outperformed it. This is installed on an off-grid, solar powered camper trailer so I was able to test the amperage draw compared to the incandescent bulb it replaced. Power draw of the factory 1156LL was 2 amps, compared to this LED at .02amp draw. Light outputs of the two are very similar.  I'm not disappointed with them, but I expected a brighter light.

They are much better looking than the halogen bulb on on 2001 Lexus LX470. Thought they would be brighter and make a difference on the road, but they dont. Seems to illuminate a bit more only. Looks a lot nicer the the lazy yellow light.

I bought this and the Bick 4 conditioner to compare them on my old BMW leather seats.  I did one front seat with the leather honey, and the other with the Bick 4.  I beat the hell out of this old leather, and it still looks and feels great.  I just got a wild hair to "treat" the leather one day and couldn't decide which product, so I ordered both.  The Leather Honey is clear, thick, (just like honey) and you'd SWEAR it would be sticky by how it applies...But it's not at all.  Weird stuff.  So I cleaned both front seats and put a couple of coats on over two days.  It's been almost a week...No noticeable difference at all.  Maybe a touch of shine with the LH, but I'm not even sure about that.  Leather feels the same, no softer, no smoother.  I've always heard that you need to "condition" or "treat" leather seats, but I can't tell I put it on.  For that matter, the Bick 4 fared no better on the passenger seat.  Can't even tell I put it on.  I'm a retired BMW tech.  The only treatment I've ever applied is butt sweat and spilled Pepsi...  They still look and feel like new.  I can't explain it.  I'm glad I did it, I guess.  But both the Leather Honey and Bick 4 will be going on a shelf in the garage probably to be thrown away 15 years from now...

I have ordered these decals in the past in a smaller size. Both times, I received the decals as described. The decals are good quality. I had no problems applying them to my vehicles. You just have to be patient and careful when sticking them on. They look great on my truck. I highly recommend these decals.

Not only did these not require a resistor, they actually fixed the hyper blink issue I had before WHEN I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE BULBS IN THESE SOCKETS (the others messed with my tail lights so I removed them). I've spent a ton on bulbs recently, testing and retesting. These are clear as ever and the quality is unmatched.-2000 Chevy Blazer.

These r great mirrors esp for the $. I read a lot of reviews & looked at several mirrors, glad I got these. Install was easy, about 10 mins. Trickiest part is getting them adjusted just the way u like. There is little to no blur in the mirror at speed. I like the size & shape of these & I think they look good on my jeep. I take these off when my doors go back on & it is very easy w/1 knob to loosen(bracket stays on the pillar).

Great Hitch Step for suv's truck etc.. does look better than the black one in my eyes since i'v had both and the chrome one is a keeper it's pricier but as they say you get what you pay for not that the black one is bad but it's all a matter of taste. the only reason it's not getting my 5 stars is because it still giggles a little even with the anti sway screw / kit included not when i'm driving but when i step on it to reach my roof rack. check out the pictures it looks good on my 4x4 truck.

I have two of these.  One on each side of my truck between the rear wheel and the tail light.  They are great, they have survived many trips through the car wash.  They are 3 dimensional, adhere well, and are very reflective.  A picture cannot do them justice.

Works too good. Very accurate RPM readings that update pretty continuous. Awesome that you can replace battery without resetting information. Awesome that you can set service intervals (like 10 hour oil changes on WR250F). Very easy to install.. You will need to take the tank off to get to the plug on a WR though. Another helpful hint is that on the modern dirt bikes that have boot style spark plug systems, you actually have to wrap it around the plastic head of the boot. NOT the wire that extends to it. Picture is a little unclear but that is the jist of it. Also, for some reason, this style of ignition must mess somethin up in the detection of spark because you have to set the meter to the 2 stroke settings to get an accurate reading. So don't worry if your bike is idling at 3500 when you first install it (was a little spooked), just change the setting to 2 stroke instead of 4 stroke. I don't know why, but hey, this thing works great! Absolutely great for the price. No trail rider should go without one.

These are not white as stated in the descriptions, even on the packaging it says white, but after installing it and comparing it with the original, there are no difference at all. Have attached a picture of the back packaging. It says up to 3400k - 3700k, base on what I saw, it is more like 3100k. I have 2016 Odyssey, and installed H11 LED low beam, from LASFIT. Those works fantastic! A lot of manufacturer are having a hard time with the 9005 DRL/High beam. That is why I got these Philips Crystal Vision. But these by all means at not even close to their claim of 3700k. So be aware. Glad that I can return these to Amazon. One last thing, average lifetime is only 300hr.

So far ever lasfit bulb I have bought I have been extremely happy with. The customer service that they provide is excellent. I work retail so a happy customer is huge. I just purchased there lasfit ls 9007 headlight led bulbs and will be installing them later today. I have no doubt in my mind I will be happy with them. Every light bulb in my truck is threw lasfit, only bulbs that aren't are the led light bulbs for inside of my truck. You won't be disappointed in there product. I have gone threw three set of head light bulbs and haven't found what I like for my Frontier. True test will be tomorrow morning when I leave for work! But again I don't believe that I will be disappointed. I haven't yet and I am picky......

You have to adjust the feet so it's a snug fit to the bed of the truck and won't shift under the push and pull of the hitch you mount to it.  It's a process so take your time.  It involves a lot of test fittings of the adapter and the hitch.

Fit my 2018 Forester 2.5i Premium.  It would be nice if they came w/ instructions, but they are easy to find online.  The Subaru instructions aren't very clear for the front removal and installation.  It doesn't mention, upon removal, that it feels like you're going to "break" the original black molding and two trim clips off, which is okay, since you discard all of them anyway.  The install is very easy.  For the rear, the only removal is one push rivet.  For the installation, I used a ratcheting wrench (8mm) instead of a Phillips screwdriver to tighten the two bolts on each side.  The splash guards look great!

My god!!!!!  This is one of the greatest mods I put in my car. I am pleased. I was debating for a while to purchase this but I'm glad I did. The amazing thing about this knob is that it feels heavy (heavier than the stock one, I drive a 2006 si) but once you install it, it feels very light. I took it for a test drive and it feels great. I'm glad I went with the silver one since my interior is black, the knob sticks out more.

After reading various reviews on how the product wasn't working and the overall score I still decided to take a chance on the product. I used this for my jeep grand cherokee 2015 and immediately when I received the product I noticed that the picture from this webpage didn't match what I received. Instead of small tabs with a small piece of tape, the product has a solid tab from one end to the other with a long strip of continuous tape. It feels like they may have now modified their design based on the feedback but they should probably update this image to reflect that. So after noticing that I went ahead with the installation and one thing I would also call out is that the instructions page that I got had no English instructions.  They were spanish/french. This wasn't a huge deal for me as I more or less figured it out from watching videos online about it, in fact you can get the instructions from their website if you want to. I took the advise from the feedback i read in some reviews and made sure that the front/back tabs didn't go into the window channel but rather between the door post/rubber and set the visors in for 24+ hrs. I've now used them for a couple days and they feel sturdy and look great, it is a very slim profile that doesn't interfere with the chrome trim around my windows. Overall I'm glad I took the risk and went ahead with the purchase as some of the other options are way more expensive and don't look or feel any better.  If I had only one complaint it would be the white company AVS logo on them but I'm sure you could do something about that yourself.

I was installing these converting to Koni Cut-A-Strut on my 2005 GTO.I was at first frustrated and confused like many other reviewers as these didn't match the original covers. However, after playing with them a bit, and doing some research, I realized that these work fine, but don't have to be secured in the way the old covers were.Basically they won't cover the full strut when first installed. I was trying to stretch them like the OEM rubber covers and then secure it with a zip tie. This doesn't work.Eventually However, I follow the instructions and inserted the bump stop the Bellows following the instructions. If you ignore the fact that they are too "Short" at first, once you compress the strut and install it, they cover it perfectly. The design allows it to vent out the bottom of the cover, without having to seal it with a zip tie.This is fundamentally a different design from the original, but functions well

One complaint I have is the screen "could" have been a touch screen. Maybe I am expecting too much for a tuner that runs 400 dollars. The menu is user friendly and simple which is good. One issue I will share is the tuner for whatever reasons would not make my Ford Racing injectors work correctly. The tuner did everything else but my injectors so I'm somewhat happy. I was unhappy that Ford Racing Parts were not found anywhere in the tuner to upgrade to. I would prefer to pick EXACTLY what I have installed instead of something close. Overall the tuner is the best I have seen but it could have been better.

This is a good filter in terms of its filtering area, construction quality. However it is not the type of oil filter your vehicles come with from the factory.The original oil filter uses different filtering element and it has a different construction. Original factory Toyota filters are made in Japan, this Denso 150-1002 is made in Thailand. It is still better than dealer installed Toyota OEM filters (made by Denso also) because the can is sturdier and heavier than dealer filters. Dealer filters do not have SILICONE ADBV but this Denso does.Take a look at all three filters (Toyota OEM installed by dealers, DENSO aftermarket, Toyota OEM Japan-made filter from factory) side by side in product photos.The price of this filter should be $3-3.50 at most. That is how much I pay elsewhere.

Sept. 2016 UPDATE:  Last week after work I went to my car and got only clicking from the starter.  (The battery was 9 years old!)  I had this charger in the trunk and it started my car easily and immediately.  (This is an older 3-series BMW.)  I drove from there to my mechanic, and he said someone had tried to sell him one of these jump-starters but he didn't bite because he didn't think they'd really work, so he was surprised to hear what I had to say.  Anyhow, I can now say I've used if for it's most useful role!I've given a few of these jump starters as Xmas gifts so have some familiarity with them, and I think this one is among the best.  Its very compact, comes in a good (and not over-sized) carrying/storage case, and at 18,000mAh has twice the power of the one I most recently reviewed.  The 9000 mAh one was fine, but the extra capacity of this one is certainly a bonus.Ive sold my old Isuzu Trooper since I bought my first battery pack/jump-starter, and it was that car that I occasionally let sit too long and then needed to jump.  I haven't recently come across anyone needing a jump, so although Ive tested this battery pack in other ways, I haven't actually used it to start a car.  Based on prior experience I can at least attest to the ability of these things to start even relatively large engines with entirely drained batteries, i.e., my old Trooper.  Not only do they work, but Ive felt safe in using them, much more so than the old days of having to use long cables and a second car.  These are so easy to use that even taking time to properly read the directions and going slowly, from the time I popped the hook to the time I disconnected the jump-starter was under five minutes, and that was the very first time.  Once I knew the process it takes less than a minute.  Theres no waiting for anything to charge, you simply set the battery pack somewhere flat and stable in the engine compartment, connect the cables and turn the key.  Not quite fool-proof perhaps, but close, and I can now jump cars with none of trepidation I felt in the old days of connecting cables from one car to another.  I certainly appreciate the built in feature that prevents it working with reversed polarity.I haven't jumped a car yet, but I've used this battery to charge a variety devices and it's done well.  What I didn't understand initially, and maybe don't fully understand still, is the relationship between a batterys ability to put out a large amount of electricity quickly, as when jump-starting a car, and the overall electrical storage of a battery pack.  I thought something strong enough to start a large engine would have the power to recharge things like smartphones dozens of times, but I think thats not a good correlation.  I think its more like the difference between explosive muscle strength and endurance; they're two different things.  In other words you won't recharge a cell phone dozens of times without needing to recharge the jump-starter.  I cant quantify this because Ive recharged various devices rather than simply recharging the same device repeatedly.Given that I no longer need to jump-start a car on a semi-regular basis, what I find the most useful is the wide variety of cable adapters; Ive only had use for a couple so far, but it seems Im likely to be able to recharge things regardless of the specific shape/size of the power port.Everything in the Amazon description and product details seem to be correct so far as I can tell.I received this jump-starter at a discount in exchange for writing this review, but a discount isn't enough to keep me from writing an accurate account of my experience.  I haven't found any negatives to write about.

I wasn't so sure about this programmer at first but I had the money and NEEDED better performance/MPG. I recently lifted my 07 NNBS Silverado 6 inches with 35x20 tires and I went from 17 MPG to 11 MPG it was awful, after the edge set on economy I went back up to about 15 MPG and then wanted to try the performance (current) and I am seeing about 14-15 but definitely love stepping on the gas. (ALL HAND CALCULATED MPG) After reading reviews and descriptions I was definitely impressed with the features it has and what it does for my truck! The dash mount is a little confusing to install but I made it work and Ive already got Cummins, Duramax, and Powerstroke owners wanting one for their truck!

This hitch was fairly easy to install, its good to have a set of 1/2" drive sockets. It is not necessary to remove the whole bumper, but I did so I could spray the inside of the bumper with clear coat rustoleum spray also sprayed the installation hardware(Tip: If you remove your bumper,first remove the two license plate bulb assemblies.) I used a floor jack to hold up one side of the hitch while I installed the other, also used a rubber mallet to whack it into place because the tolerances are very tight. I installed the hitch plus the #55513 wiring kit.

Wired them up on my 08 civic with a relay triggered from the original horn wire, and they sure are loud. I mounted them to a bracket off the front bumper so they hang down perfectly in the lower front grille giving a nice aggressive look. It took a while to get them both to blast at full power at the same time, but the problem ended up being my ground like was too long. Once I shortened this up the horns worked perfectly.

I installed this harness on a 1997 Jeep Wrangler to power a 50'' LED Bar 288W. I went into a trail run and the LED light was heavily used. I noticed that the wire turned extremely hot. The following day I turned on the LED Light and after 1 minute of use the harness shorted and melted. Try to replace the 30A fuse and as soon I turn the light the fuse goes out (3 fuses blown out). Disconnected the LED bar and connected directly to the battery and it works. In summary this harness is not capable of handling a 50'' LED Bar as stated by other reviews. However, it might be good for smaller lights.2/13/16. Update. After rewiring my LED Light Bar with a higher gauge wire I found this was the problem with this wiring. As mentioned before the cable would turn very hot that it melted the insulation exposing/shorting the circuit (pic attached).

One of them had moisture ingression after a week out in the rain.  Prior to installation, I did seal the cable entry into the units, to prevent this very problem.  Apparently you need to put silicone around every imaginable entry.  I have a second set that I plan on installing on a different truck and will use silicone on these before installation.  But the manufacturer should've taken the time to install better gaskets.  Just glad I paid under $20 for each pair.Update 9/23/2016:Contacted by seller in getting a photo of the suspect light with condensation.  I will attach a photo I took with my digital camera.

I bought my new jeep back in Feb 2016, Its starting to get over 100 degrees here now so I thought I had better get a sun screen for my jeep, I have had them before on other cars that I have owned and most of the time I didn't use them because they were a pain to put up as they were just generic screens that were "one size fits all" and either to big or to small,So looking here on Amazon I wanted to see if they made one specifically for my jeep, and I came across this one, I read the reviews and decided to purchase it, I received it the other day and I am more than happy with it, it is very sturdy and doesn't flop around as you are putting it up, and it fits my Jeep's windshield very nice.It looks well built and should do the job of keeping that over 100 degree heat off of my dash board, and keep the interior cooler.

The picture is completely different. The texture goes horizontally, not vertically like the picture shows. Also, I thought it would just have the brushed aluminum look only because I bought it to wrap the interior of my Infiniti G35, but you can feel the texture. Not that bad, but the only thing I would complain about was the fact that the texture goes horizontally.. Also, the color is a lighter silver

Product did not match picture, almost like someone sold me a knock off product.  The spacer blocks did not have the company logo on them but not a big deal.  The fasteners were standard and not metric, again not a big deal but the fasteners were too long and contacted the CV axle.  The picture on Amazon and the instructions show thin metric nuts but that is not what came in the kit.  I had to add my own washers under the head of the bolt and use a thin flange nut with blue loctite to clear the axle.  See pictures.  Also, the instructions were of poor quality as you could tell they had been photo copied.I did like that these are aluminum spacer blocks rather than plastic like the competition.  That is the reason I bought this kit but not happy about the problems with the fasteners.  Maybe should have bought straight from MotoFab as I think these were a knock off.I installed this kit on a 2017 GMC Sierra 1500 4WD

This fit my White 2016 Suburban LT w/ running boards perfectly! the flaps looks as if they came from factory and gave her the "complete" look. I was tired of having to swerve around puddles because the tires would kick up EVERYTHING onto the fenders and doors, this was an inexpensive fix to the problem and cost a fraction of what I spent weekly washing the car. Just make sure you get this exact model number for this vehicle otherwise it won't fit. what i did was, I went to WeatherTechs website first, typed in my vehicle information (as if i was going to order) then took those numbers over to amazon (who had a MUCH lower price) and placed my order.Ive read alot of reviews in regards to them "not fitting" or the "tires rubbing on the flaps when you turn"... this might be true if you get the wrong model, they all look alike but the screw diagram and fit is different, it should all be flush. I suggest visiting weathertech website to confirm before ordering here. took me around 20 min to do the whole car... as i said before, if you have a 2016 suburban LT with running boards, this will fit. if you doubt go to weather tech first.

So there are a lot of posts calling these crap, and I think that this is probably one of those Chinese quality control issues.  This is one of those "luck of the draw" items, and I happened to get lucky.  Couldn't tell you what the quality to crap ratio is, but just be aware that you will probably get a good set rather than a crap one.  Remember that it's the people who get the crap ones that will be the most vocal.The mirrors were extremely easy to install and after a bit of figuring out how each joint worked, I was able to get them solidly set.  No instructions included, but really you don't need them.  I personally had no problem with having to tighten to near stripping on any of the screws.  One thing to remember, especially if you're like me and don't do a lot of bike work on a regular basis and tend to forget some of the basics:  make sure you tighten down ALL of the screws during installation, even if you don't think you need to.  The nuts for the screws that hold the the actual mirrors on vibrated off after a while because they don't come pre-tightened from the factory.  Stupid mistake on my part, but something to think about.  Luckily for me, I have them mounted so they're just above the handlebar, so the screws weren't able to go anywhere except against the handlebar and I just picked up replacement nuts today.  I got a pair of 5mm locking nuts for $1 from Home Depot, which are honestly probably a better idea than the cap nuts that came with the set in the first place.  A lot of people also complain that the mirrors will fold in at high speed, but I've had it up quite high on several occasions (won't say how high publicly) and only one folded in, and that was only after a while of riding and mostly because I had yet to replace the aforementioned nuts.  They're really hard to move now with the nuts on and tightened, so I don't expect to have any further issues with unwanted folding.A couple of tips to make your life easier:1)  If you can put your stock end caps on your bars and sandwich these between your handlebar and the cap, you get a really solid mount that won't move on you at all.  I can't even force them to rotate around the bars with my hands, so I don't think they're going anywhere.  Depending on the length of your bar end caps, you may be limited on the angles you can use, since the mirrors probably won't stick out past the caps, but for me it's worth it to know that they're not going anywhere.  My reason for doing this at first was simply because I disliked the idea of my handlebars ending in the mirror mount, and I really like the look with the stock bar caps on my bike.  It was a bonus to realize the benefit of sandwiching it in.  I posted a couple of pictures of my installation for reference.2) If you go with using the above mentioned step, make sure you still tighten down the handlebar mounting screws on the actual mirror mount really well, as the top one controls the friction on the mirror adjustment point.  It moved around on it's own quite a bit before I realized that.  Rock solid now.Last thought:  Yes, these are very cheap, but they look nice on my bike and after a bit of playing around they seem really solid.  If you happen to get a good set, it's absolutely worth the money.  And even if you end up having to buy two or three sets before getting a good one, you're spending $30-45 for something that costs $120 a pair for the quality stuff.

It went on very easily. Like many of the reviews it takes time. So be prepared for that. However, this is the most natural looking cover I can imagine having. Leather feels very good not a cheap feel. And for the price you cannot go wrong here.One thing I would stress is be certain of your steering wheel circumference. Definitely measure the "fatest" part of your steering wheel to select the proper size. but all sizes are the same circumference it appears and the gmt-400 platform, my truck (1995 K1500 and all 88-98 chevy and gmc trucks and suv's) it slips over the wheel snuggly before even threading. I can't stress this enough. because even as I worked the threads all the way around by the time I got back to the start point it was a little bunched up. If your steering wheel is smaller than the indicated size you certainly won't have a perfect fit. slightly larger and I'm sure you can stretch the leather a bit. Anyhow I took out the threads back to the nearest spoke and threaded one more holeon the opposite side of the start point to pull the leather that direction. That worked perfectly for me. I've got a little exposed thread around that spoke but it is hardly noticeable, and more importantly it almost looks stock!I used the supplied threads and needles. I know a few reviews have said one or both are not good for the job. But I decided to just try them out. Ended up just finishing the job with them. they worked fine! Not sure what the issue was about with others and why some say you need to widen the holes I had no such issues. The only threading issues I had were concerned with when I accidentally knotted the string on itself. Most of the time I was able to un knot them when I first felt them catch on the holes. This is important not to pull it through when you feel the resistance because it will be near impossible to un-knot them after you force it through. That being said, it happened to me a couple times and it caused no issue. Just tugged it through each time and there was no adverse affect nor was it impossible to get through. Even the knot's came through the holes without too much issue.I think it looks great. It feels even better, like a new wheel. Highly recommend this product. all in all, from the start of the project, and of Forest Gump, I got to where Forest started running across the country when I completely finished, with a lot of small breaks where I just watched the movie, and I started threading it (and un-threading it) three times (to test out the look of each of the options). Not too bad.

These give off a lot of vibration, and the bolts are a pain to get in but i cant complain for the durability of them and the style, I hit a mailbox with one when it was fully extended and they withstood the impact, did not damage, break the glass, or the plastic that is used to house these mirrors. Very nice! Not powered or have the turn signal lights in them is kind of the downside. You can get them for 10 dollars more with the lights and powered. So i dunno why you would pay this much for these.

Installed as aux reverse lights on my 2010 Power Wagon. Plan to replace the bumper in a year or two anyway, so didn't want to spend too much on lights. While they don't have the light output of a Rigid or other high dollar brand, the bang for the buck is excellent. These do a great job. I don't trust the sealing job, so I went over all the seals with RTV silicone just to be sure. The factory sealant where the power cord comes in was already pulling off when I got it. So far they have held up well as of 2/7/18 any issues will be updated here. *Note: these will not sit flush on a rounded bumper like on a Dodge 2500, but it doesn't bother me* See photos

What a fantastic product.  I cleaned up the plastic trim on my Subaru Forester and it looked pretty good, though the trim wasn't bad to begin with.  I decided to try some on my truck fender flairs, which were so bad I'd written them off as simply needing to be replaced.  NOPE.  Within five minutes of work they came back to life and look fantastic.  I agree with another reviewer that you need to use a little bit of elbow grease, but the instructions tell you to use moderate pressure so I was expecting a bit of work.  Really, it's not hard to do and it a topping of Mother's Back-to-Black really makes the little bit of effort very satisfying.  And it works on plastic which wasn't black to begin with.  My Forester has a dark gray trim and the results were also quite good.

If you have some light cutting to do on your vehicle, you would be hard pressed to find a better product. Any task I throw at these pads (swirl removal, water spot removal, mid grade compound for refinishing, etc...) they handle well. I have noticed that these are a new "formula" from their earlier pads. Longevity and durability are much improved.

So far, I love these as fog lights on my Tacoma.  I wired them into my plate bumper, and the fit was perfect.  Without the amber covers, they are blinding bright and will be great on the night trails that we run.  With the amber covers on, they work awesome as fogs for in town.  Nobody has high-beamed me yet, and the fill is great even though they are spots.  Point them down a little below your main headlights, and they really help.The true test will be over time, especially after they get wet a few times and get shaken around on the trails.  If I get 1 year out of them, I will be happy with my purchase.  I got 2 full years out of my previous LED fogs before one started losing LEDs one by one from moisture creep after multiple power washes.My pictures show one with both amber covers installed, and the other shows one cover off to compare color temp.  I'm running Osram bulbs which are brighter than factory Toyota bulbs.

The description states "Waterproof switch, but not sealed."  I don't know how you make something waterproof *without* sealing it.  Regardless, this switch cannot remotely be termed "waterproof" when the switching terminals will be subject to any and all moisture that the switch encounters.  Furthermore, being copper, I would expect them to corrode in short order.  In an effort to alleviate (or at least delay) this, I filled the switch body with dielectric grease prior to installation, and I'll be careful not to hit it directly with water when washing the ATV.  Mechanically, the switch seems to click into position firmly; however, the small screw fasteners screw into only plastic, and could be stripped if one is not careful upon installation.  Fortunately, mine tightened up on the handlebar without requiring excessive torque.  The wire gauge is extremely small for what is advertised as a "light" switch (approx 22 ga.) and will require a relay for all but the smallest of LED pods.Does the switch work?  Yes.  Will it hold up on an ATV?  With the addition of the dielectric grease, it may stand a fighting chance, but time will tell.  Would I look to other solutions in the future?  Most definitely.

These are white! And with directional LED they work great for my third brake light and license plate lights, or markers where having 4 LEDS facing the same direction can be used, which makes them bright. No Out of Box failures. Note: If they do not work out of box, try removing, rotate 180 degrees, and reinstall. They only work on one polarity. Used to replace T168's. These are much brighter than the old T168's (incandescent) primarily due to 4 led's facing the same direction. You can see in the pictures the 181 degree light is pretty good. I was going to rate 4 stars but I can't think of any reason why I wouldn't rate 5 stars so... 5 stars it is. I'll report back if any ever die prematurely. Currently I have 10 hours on them.

The Olsa Tools socket holder works really well and red anodized rails makes it look good too.  The individual socket holder/clip have a detent ball bearing that locks onto your sockets like what you would see on a rachet or extension.  Sockets go on of off with ease unlike spring metal or plastic holders.  The better spring metal ones you have to fight them to get sockets off, the cheap metal ones you have to worry about not bending them when pulling too hard, and the plastic ones, you have to twist and pull.  You don't have to do any of that with the Olsa Tools socket holder set, these things have ball bearing detent that holds the sockets securely yet still easy to access your sockets.  The aluminum rails are strong and sturdy and won't twist or flex and have slots milled along the center so that they can mounted to a table, tool box draw, or a tray. The way the cross sectional area of the extrude aluminum rail is shaped, you can even mount two rails back to back with proper length nuts and bolts and have sockets pointing out in opposite direction, one side metric, one side standard or one side 1/2" and the other side 3/8" or whatever you feel like.  Like many other socket holders the individual socket holder are all the same width for 1/4", 3/8", and 1/2" so you can mix and match different sizes on the same rail too.  The only bad thing about these socket holder rails is now I have to decide which sockets are worthly of being placed on them.

This fit on my Jeep TJ with slight modification to the hood. Base plate bolted in perfect. The catch plate however didn't like up right so I drilled an additional hole above the existing 2 in order to get it lined up and locked in correctly. Look great. Very beefy. Eliminated my hood rattle. Electrical tape is just covering the original unused hole.

Great cover! I had envisioned a DIY bed cover for my Tacoma's rail system; however, that's not feasible due to parts of the truck that are in the way. You can't just slide plywood into the rails.The cover goes on in ten minutes ands seems relatively secure. Parts of the locking mechanism are plastic so I backed it up with some lashing straps to my bed's d-rings.My cover came with the led light, some gloves, and cleaning equipment/solution.The cover also covers the bed really well; there are no gaps (front or rear).Do yourself a favor and get a tailgate lock when you order this cover; it can easily be stolen without one.

I got this for my 2011 Honda Pilot. It's better than I expected. The finish on the chrome is not top notch, i.e. some bumps and scratches on it and it's a bit rusted inside of the unit, but that's really not a big deal. From two feet away you don't notice the imperfections in the chrome finish and it looks great. You never see teh rust inside the 2x2 pipe unless you take it out and looks inside it. It's solid and heavy - all metal. And I thought it would be flush with the receptacle once I put in the pin (5/8), but it actually sticks out about one inch from the back of my SUV. I really like that. Gives a bit more protection if anyone should touch your car with their bumper in the parking lot or something. I was even considering getting a real hitch attachement for that purpose (to protect the bumper from small hits), but that would get my pants dirty when I'd putting things in the back. So this thing is perfect - looks great and sticks out a bit, but not as much as to create an inconvenience. NOTE: you need to get a pin separatelly. It takes a 5/8 inch max. (I got&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Curt-Manufacturing-21500-5-8-In-Hitch-Pin-With-Clip-Polybag-W-Upc/dp/B0007LZK9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Curt Manufacturing 21500 5/8 In Hitch Pin With Clip Polybag W/Upc</a>) but check your car's receptacle hole to make sure you don't need a smaller pin (like a 1/2 inch)/ On Honda Pilot 2011 it's 5/8. Also I put some duct tape around the 2x2 part that goes inside the receptacle (you so you can't see it) to make sure it fits snugly and wouldn't rattle on bumps.

This sia great basket, assembled together easily. I gave it four stars due to the problems I had to go through to mount it to my roof rails. I bought this basket carrier for my 2014 Equinox LT. The LT comes with a factory roof rails, but I needed to buy some crossbars to mount the basket. The crossbars and the U-Bolts provided would not work. I needed to buy a 3/4" wide strip of aluminium, cut into approx 6" lengths and drill two holes into the ends of each strip. I had to buy new bolts, lock washers, wing-nuts and some ribber material. It was also necessary to drill two new holes in the roof rails to get the rear cross member to line up properly on the basket. See images for the finals look of the brackets. It took about an hour to do the install once I have all the parts ready. I also bought the Curt bag and it looks very sturdy and water tight.

Based on first impressions: It arrived in a very well packaging, no shipping damages. Very light weight! I've included pictures if all the inside measurements. I am using this on my Teardrop Trailer for my inverter, batteries + solar charge controller. Seem's to be very well constructed. No play in the latching of the lid. Gas strut to assist opening the lid. Comes with keys for the lock. Would recommend to a friend.

As a woman always on the go, my trunk often looked like a mess and I would be embarrassed to open it in front of my friends and family.  I decided it was time to get organized and jumped at the chance to try out this organizer.The organizer arrived folded down into a little square that was easy to open up and it was ready to go in a matter of seconds.  There are two main bins that are large enough to hold my blankets and beach towels on one side as well as my yoga mats and misc. work out supplies on the other.  There are two small pouches on the sides as well as mesh pockets that are perfect for holding water bottles, cups, sunscreen and anything else that finds it way into my trunk!  The organizer also comes with a small, but convenient, cooler which folds away when not in use and is easy to pull out when I have some cold groceries or want to take a picnic lunch to the beach.  When my family is coming into town, the organizer easily folds down to make room for their suitcases and bags!I have absolutely no complaints about this organizer and my trunk is a thousand times more organized! I was offered this item free for my objective evaluation and unbiased review.

did not hold up against the wait of my car trunkmy struts in my trunk broke long ago, i can't find the correct size bolt to fit the hole, after years of trying the hole toast, nothing fit it now... i bought this and put putty into the hole, then screwed bolt in, then put more putty on the outside of the bolt, let it dry 48 hours, it seems like it work, i put it all back together, and closed my trunk and SNAP, this stuff didn't hold my trunk lid, if it cant hold the wait of a mitsubishi eclipse gt trunk lid than i don't understand how it bonds engine parts... i tried it again the next day with even more and boom it snapped again... i gave up

This fit perfect on my 2015 Ninja 650. The pull distance and lever feel are spot on to my liking. They went on in just a few minutes with basic tools. My only gripe that I have (why it's a 4star not a 5) is that after a few months the black faded to a muted shade of green, doesn't match the white and black of the bike.

Originally Amazon showed that this was a fit for my 2004 4Runner... not so. It does not fit 2003-2005 4Runners because they have straight tow hooks. I had my hitch cut and rewelded so it would fit my 2004 Runner. The way it attaches to the tow hooks is far from ideal and might lower the load capacity but it works for what I needed it for - which was occasional boat jockeying from the front bumper.

These are heated and have power-glass, which are the only two mirror functions my truck has. These are great, only issue (99%of tow mirrors have this) is they need to be leveled if you want them to look as good as they function! I leveled mine in about 25 mins and they look awesome!

I installed these light bulbs in my Honda Fit, the interior is black, and the only lights available are 2 map readers, 1 central dome, and the cargo area, there are no lights in the foot wells.It made a great improvement, these lights are bright and white and they are the right intensity as not to bother me, if I need to turn-on the map readers while driving, certainly there are brighter ones, but I believe this to be the right ones for my application.They are brighter and white compared to the stock incandescent.No problems, these lights dim to turn off when I close the car; I had no issues with the polarity. PnPThe dome and maps readers are just push and on, but the cargo area socket is a bit weird, so I had to push the lights in, a slightly pull back so they will make a proper contact to the terminals.The other thing that I like about LED light bulbs is that they do not get hot like an incandescent, so it will prolong the life of the lenses.Sorry for the pics, but it is difficult to take a picture off a light while on.

Fantastic!The first ride said it all. I rode 180 miles from Phoenix to the southern end of the Devil's Highway and all the way up, only to realize that I had none of the same aches and pains of the OEM seat. This seat is not only comfortable but it looks good. I find my weight is evenly distributed and even on long rides, I sit comfortable and don't move around like on the OEM seat.It is a little thicker so you sit a little taller in the seat so check your seat height before you take the plunge. But if you have a little flex in the height, GO FOR IT!Install could not be easier. On my bike (Honda Sabre) I removed the OEM seat by removing the 2 screws at the front of the seat and the 1 screw at the back in the fender. The Mustang seat slid into the back on the frame at the front of the seat, and uses the same screw into the back fender. Literally 2 minutes to install!!!!Great seat with a very comfortable feel and easy to get used to!

Quick easy install.  Simple use and LOVE the boost feature!!2012 Silverado 5.3L LT.  Very easy to understand wiring diagram and works great. I chose this for the boost feature so that the trailer brakes come on stronger and "lead" the braking.  This makes sure the trailer us never pushing me during braking.  There are 3 levels of boost to fit your need too.Update -7/27/16- Uses it to tow a HEAVY car trailer loaded with Kubota L225 loader/backhoe (about 7-8k lbs).  I used b2 setting and found that between 4 and 5 was best.  The trailer grabbed solid before the truck and I could feel it pulling from behind during braking.

Lasted only 11 months.  I replaced a pair of these in March of 2014 because the speed sensor on the factory original had failed.  About  2 months ago the Grand Prix started sounding like it had put monster truck tires on it.  When ever you'd drive over 20mph it would get loud, and by 40 or 50 miles per hour, you couldn't hold a conversation in the car due to the noise.  I kept wondering what the problem was, because the wheel bearings were new.  Not being able to isolate the problem, I eventually pulled the bearing out, and found out it had failed.  My only guess is the sealed bearings had failed due to the heat of the disk brakes.  Obviously I'm very disappointed to now need to do the job all over again, and buy another set.  I tried reaching out to the manufacturer, but the link to the manufacturer doesn't work.  My daugher drives this car to school, so it's normal wear and tear with the factory 16" rims, and the correct tires.  I really have no idea why they failed so quickly.

I was able to use these on a 1996 honda shadow VT1100 with the stock risers. The only thing I had to change was the clutch hydraulic line. I was able to keep stock length throttle, choke, and brake lines by rerouting them, but if you wanted to keep the stock line routing, you would need to change all of those things plus wiring. Also I had to drill a hole for the stock handle bar controls dowel pin on one side as the pre-made indentations did not go far enough outwards. I only did this on the right side for the throttle as I just moved the left side controls 1/2 inch inwards to meet the pre-made indentation. I think they look great and feel very sturdy.

This lanyard is durable, economical, and assists in keeping track of my keys. What more could you ask for? The most common problem with these lanyards is the hook breaking, but I've had this one now for over three months and haven't had any issues. The stitching (imprinting), hasn't fallen off or started to crumble even with heavy wear and tear. I'm satisfied with my purchase.

Love these mirrors, they live up to their reputation. They are built strong and carry a lifetime guarantee. Installation was easy and they are there to stay. No slipping or flopping around. You can adjust everything- the tension of the swing and the tension on the movable mirror surface are independently adjustable. Both sides have two click detents for the angle - one setting if for the driver side and another for the passenger side, plus there is a folded position. They fold completely inward for transport or storage (or for when you are plowing through brush!). The clamps are super strong and lay very flat around the tubing size that you selected. I don't have a windshield on my machine, but these mounts would most likely not cause a problem.Installation is easy and best accomplished by only loosely tightening the clamps while you play with them looking for the best angle. Once found, you can fully tighten the clamps. Bear in mind that the angle will change slightly as things get tightened - it's easily loosened and  repositioned though, and once you're happy with it, you just need to match the other side. I positioned mine at just below eye level to keep it higher than most brush, but you can put them at any height that works for you.The detents are made of Delrin - a plastic that's both durable and is designed for movement. They should last for a long time and replacement is easy when necessary. The housings are aluminum and if you brush up against something they will protect the mirror from damage. While you might not want that to happen normally, it's nice to know they will stand up to some punishment.They're a little spendy, but I really love that the housings are metal and the mechanism is very durable. Plus there's that lifetime guarantee so if anything gets broken or worn, Seizmik will replace it. They are totally worth it in my view.Simply put:1) super durable and built strong2) replaceable parts - all of it3) lifetime guarantee4) looks great!

These lights came fast and well packaged. I used these for my reverse and DLR lights on my 03 Chevy Silverado. You can see from the pictures that these lights are fairly bright but not as bright as I had hoped for especially as reverse lights they are sub par, however the main reason I bought these lights was to light up the area around my truck at night when I unlock the doors and they work great for that. The light is a very clean white so they still get four stars (mostly for the price).

Seems well built, and installation was pretty straight forward.  I have had a similar style mirror in the past and really liked it.  They are nearly there exact same thing.  Remember there is only one to a package, so if you want both sides you'll need to order two.

So, ... I tried to find out if this would work for me for a long time. No one knew, so I bought it and found out. I mounted this on a Harley Davidson brand perch mount and it works great! NO movement, no vibrating loose. Harley mount says 16.5mm. and Techmount says 17mm. THEY WORK GREAT TOGETHER. I like the Harley perch mount because it is lower profile than most other perch mount systems. The iPhone 7 Plus does NOT stick up above the fairing line with this combo.

2016 FLHXSThe difference between this and the OEM standard headlight from Harley Davidson is night and day (no pun intended) .  Crisp, clean bright white light that not only shines further but also wider closer to the front wheel.  You get both a full lane width clear view in front of you and a nice clear down the road light.  I like wearing Yellow goggles at night for clarity, with this headlight I do not see the need any longer.  And the price compared to HD unit is almost laughable.  I just installed it a week or so ago, so I cannot speak to it's longevity yet, but I will report back if it does not last as long as expected.Highly recommend

This a product that exemplifies "form over function". Visually it looks good compared to it's smaller size vs. the stock antenna but I lost 5 out the 6 FM stations I listen to. The "Stubby" is too short to serve it's primary function for radio reception, the mfg. should consider doubling the size from 6 to maybe 12 or 15 inches. I had no choice but to replace it (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SLLPO1K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I regained all of my stations I lost with the "Stubby" and no longer worry about the antenna scraping against the garage door.Picture shows Stubby vs. Antenna Mast vs. stock antenna .

These are bright LED bulbs, but I have doubts that they actually live up to 800 Lumens each. I would believe 800 Lumens combined, but when it's stated as "2 X 800" that should mean that each bulb is roughly equivalent to a standard 60w incandescent you put in your kitchen or bathroom. I'm just not seeing that much output.On the other hand, these are solid, and good looking bulbs. Most out there either look just plain ugly or some retro version of space age, but these feel more clean and well composed. They are also solid. The LED tower seems fully connected to the base, again, something which is not always true with other bulbs I've used. The little metal disc at the base of the tower just finishes the design off like a cherry, hey look, actual metal! In similar fashion, the box that they come in makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Solid black with silver recessed letters, ooooohhh!They're not all that expensive either (@ $13 currently on Prime), especially not for the quality. Longevity is the only boxed unchecked so far and I will be sure to update should I have any issues with them!Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I strive to review such products as if I had paid full price.

I did not want the XL, since the weight it could carry was what mattered to me, so i went with the Large.  It looks great on my 2016 honda pilot.  The Thule is pushed all the way back and still have about 4 inches of clearance from the tail gate when it's fully opened.  The Xl would have extended onto the sun roof which I did not want.

This was for a 16 Honda rubicon , I bought the KFI winch mount for it. The mount included won't work.  Ok the winch will only install upside down. Per customer service at Superwinch , it won't affect operation of the winch or void the warranty. Mine works fine it's just upside down. The wiring included is about 18" longer than I need. I'll need to cut and replace the connectors for a cleaner looking install. Overall I'm happy with it , just think superwinch needs to include more info on installation , like upside down mount possibility on some models.

The Yepal Classical Microfiber Drying Towel,380GSM is a high quality, very soft material. I don't think I will have to worry about scratching the finish on any paint or fiberglass.  It seems to hold as much water as a natural chamois of similar size, but their is no need to keep it moist to avoid the drying out, I really like that quality. Bit the idea of washing it out separately from other things is a downside, So I'll just hand wash it. No big deal for just a few items.  The towel is 22" x 30" and looks and feels like it is well made.  I do like the ability to use it on house windows too, it really keeps the streaking and spotting away that I deal with from hard water.  I like that I can wring it out and keep going, just like a natural one.  You can do a large vehicle with it easily.If after reading my review of this product  If you find it interesting or useful please rate it as "helpful" or leave a comment.

This is my second GPS (third if you include the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Garmin-Forerunner-305-GPS-Receiver-With-Heart-Rate-Monitor/dp/B000CSWCQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Garmin Forerunner 305 GPS Receiver With Heart Rate Monitor</a>).  I compared this review unit with a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Garmin-n-uuml-vi-855-4-3-Inch-Widescreen-Portable-GPS-Navigator-with-Speech-Recognition/dp/B001OMGVII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Garmin n&uuml;vi 855 4.3-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS Navigator with Speech Recognition</a>&nbsp;that I purchased earlier in the year.I ran around town with both the TomTom and Garmin giving me maps and directions, and found the TomTom's timing and prompts much less useful than the Garmin's.  The maps had much less detail - the Garmin shows bodies of water, side roads, etc., none of which appeared on the TomTom.  The icons to locate nearby services were not easily discerned while driving.  The menus and functionality were awkward.I was not able to test the traffic feed, as my city is too small, so will have to post more on that after my son in Los Angeles tests that out later.For many things, the weaknesses of the TomTom are addressed by the Garmin, but the weaknesses of the Garmin (and there are some) are addressed by the TomTom.  But, overall, for maps, POIs, navigation, voice prompt quality, easy of use, total number of features, features of the web site for updates and interface with Google maps, etc., I think one would do better looking at the Garmin line, even with its faults.Posting some photos comparing the two units.

I've been wanting a pair of these for years; my only regret now is that I waited so long that they no longer say "Made in USA" on them.  However, these are head and shoulders above your run-of-the-mill Chinese jack stands.  I have a pair of stands that I bought from Northern Tool awhile back and I thought they were pretty heavy-duty, but these make them look pathetic.  The Hein-Werner stands are heavier, taller, beefier, and just larger overall.I was worried about how they'd arrive since they're pretty heavy and based on other reviews their packaging is not up to the task, but they were pretty much unscathed for the most part.  I was worried when I received them and I saw yellow sticking out the side of the box, but really the only damage was a few scuffs to the blue paint where they had been banging together inside the box.  The yellow center supports were undamaged.I'd buy them again, and in fact I'm trying to decide right now if I should just go ahead and buy an additional pair while the price is down.  These are far superior to anything else I have.

take your time, do all the prep and your wheels can look great again.  My BMW wheels had 90,000 miles on them and showed it.  Cleaned, prepped and painted they look good as new.A word of caution.  This paint color does not match the original BMW wheel color, at least it did not on my 2000 BMW M Roadster.  so, if you think you can paint one bad wheel and they'll match, they will not.  This kit is great if you're refinishing all four wheels, but not good for spot repairs.BUT, having said that, the wheels look great now.Might be a little hard to tell from this photo, but they do look good as new.

My old stock flares were worn out. I tried to restore them to no avail. The worst part though was every time I took a right turn and I was in contact with water, it would splash the window. By the time I got to work, I had to wipe the two front windows and mirrors off. Same going  home. It was getting old. I took some measurements and found that the six inch flares would sit flush with the tires, started researching and found these. Although you can find similar products  for a lower price elsewhere, I can tell you that the fit and quality of these is well worth the price.it comes with extra hardware, plenty of rubber protection strip, and easy to follow instructions. They look fantastic and keep the mud from splashing on my windows which pays for itself in spades. I travel down about three miles of dirt/gravel/mud twice a day and rocks and muck are constantly flung against them. About three weeks later and they still look brand new. Great product and I would definitely recommend.

Bought this for my 2003 durango. Dont follow the amazon fitment table if you look in the droduct details it will tell you what it fits. I had to shim the throttle body intake a little, extend sensor wires, and use a smaller clamp for vacum hose connection. This isn't made for my year so i also had to buy a screw in type oxygen sensor. For only $50 it does the job pretty good if you want perfection then pay the $200. I would recomend this product and im probably going to buy another one for my 02 ram. Sounds UNBELIEVABLE.. just saying.

I usually hate writing reviews just after I purchase something that might break/wear out/ etc. within a few days.  But, I thought I'd toss this out there  for now since I can always change it later.Ok...These look dang good.  They were fitted on our 2009 Nissan Sentra.  The OEM's color began to flake and one of the prongs broke so it was just time to give the car a new look.I looked at dozens of covers and most looked like...well, covers.  So my wife and I decided on these since they looked a little more "real".  All I can say is, these look fantastic.  Time will tell if they maintain their looks or even stay on, but right now we love them.There is a little bit of a setting with the coil wire that adds pressure to the prongs.  You have a choice a "small" "medium" and "large".  There is no reference for compare since I thought 16" is 16". Medium might have been alright, but they still came off without much effort.  So I finally opted for the tightest setting, which still seemed just a tad too tight, but I didn't want them falling off in the car wash.If you can't afford or too stingy to opt for real rims, these are about the closest your going to get with covers.

Overall Good bike. Almost a year now and the bike is still good. No issue except for the Carb. Had to adjust the jet needle multiple times to keep the bike from boggin. ALWAYS USE 91 Octane. I put in 87 cause it was cheaper and the bike sucked butt. Leason learned on my end. I also replace the graphic with the graphics from 2009 YZ250s to give the bike a better look. Other than that great riding. Unfortunately, i gained some weight due to medical issues but this bike still hauls pretty damn fast. Great bike though.

I actually bought this bulb at a local Autozone store. First of all, they are very expensive. 10 bucks for just one bulb. They would flicker most of the time. If you move it a little, it would start to flicker on and off. It seems to only flicker when I put it in the license plate light or the trunk light. It doesn't really flicker as much, or not at all when I put it in the interior lights. Also the color of the bulb varies depending on where you look at on the cap of the bulb. On the very top center of the bulb, the color is white with a hint of blue. But on the side of the bulb, the color is more white and yellowish. In the picture you can see that in some part, the light is yellow and green and in some part, the light is white with blue tint. These bulb doesn't worth the money.

I was looking for a product that took much of the work out of detailing my rims. When I read the description of detailer 365, I was curious what would happen if I sprayed it on before I washed my truck and washed off after scrubbing down everything else. I TRY to keep my rims from getting too much build up but I let them go, without cleaning them for a few weeks, to see how it would work.When I sprayed on the 365, it was foamy, stayed where I sprayed for, worked it's way around the rim, inside and outside. When I was done scrubbing down my truck, I rinsed off my rims. As I was rinsing, I saw the build up run off. It had gotten the grime off for the most part and I had very little wiping to do. But as I said, I do try to keep my rims pretty clean, so that may have helped.

I'm pretty demanding of the detailing products I use. Only very good results with speed are in my daily kit.  This is one of those.  Do NOT spray it on the surface.  Spray on a microfiber applicator, one side only until moist (not soaked) whilst outside of the car, then wipe the surfaces.  Apply with the car off and keys nowhere near you so that you can get to the console areas with ease.  Use on everything but glass before all other steps on surfaces.  Excellent results and I'd buy this elsewhere but nobody else seems to have exactly this product.  Smells very much like new Audi.

Product arrived undamaged. It's funny how you can tell if it's made in China by noticing the following:1. The bar code indicates "New"2. The terminology printed on the box.This one printed the following verbatim: " You can refit car audio in best times through using this product, And it can avoid cavsing any damnification to your vehicle. Incidental tool kit svitable for different vehicles. " Made In China.You got to love it! :-)  You would think they'd use spell and grammar checkers.....Pieces are fairly sturdy and will definitely help with removing plastic panels without causing damage to them.I used the straight piece just now and it worked perfectly with removing map and dome light panels for LED replacements.Much better to use plastic than metal spatulas and the sort which have a tendency to mar and/or break plastic panels.

I live in the desert, and it gets HOT. Still, I think these should have lasted longer than they did. I've had them going on two years now, but the cracking and peeling started after the first summer. No way they're going to make it through this summer. The picture only shows one of the covers, but all four are the same (or worse). I'll be looking for new ones, but unfortunately it won't be these.

I just bought this at the parts store - used it to clean the 3/4" white walls on my old Cadillac. Excellent results with the least amount of effort of all cleaning methods to date. Here's what I did. I bought the Hot Rims cleaner and a tire cleaning brush. Sprayed the foam on thick to dry white wall tire. Scrubbed lightly all around for about 30 seconds, light pressure. Sprayed foam on again thick. Scrubbed lightly again. Sprayed off with the hose. Before, the tire was so dirty that you couldn't see the white wall stripe. Check out the after photo. Didn't even break a sweat.

I bought these pads to replace old ones on my 2008 Town and Country. So far they're holding up well. I did have a problem with a rusted on rotor. A real pain to get off.

Replaced my sun-damaged, ripped, stock OEM wheel with this Italian crafted beauty. The leather is tight and the wheel contours in just the right spots for a full and comfortable grip. This thing has a timeless beauty that can work in any car. 4 or 6 point racing harness and seats are advisable as you have to remove the airbag. I paired it with the Boss hub kit and followed a YouTube DIY video to install it myself in a matter of 15-30min.

Sonny Perdue recently signed into law a bill banning texting while driving.  Enter this little device, which has allowed me to make a quantum leap in driving productivity.Rather than use the little keyboard on my G1 to use SMS or Gmail, I now have my Dell XPS 1550 to hand.  With a data plan from a telco that will remain nameless, I am now able to VPN into my company's MS Exchange server and do email, *while* *zooming* *up* *GA 400* *at* *80 MPH*!!!  I can even teleconference while on the go, and the Alpharetta cops can't lay a hand on me!  This is AWESOME!!!Mind you, my car has gotten a little dinged up, but that's why I drive a beater:  All the scrapes and dents give me  that "Road Warrior" look that translates into minimal hassle on the way to work.I can't recommend this device highly enough.  Get one now before spoilsport Sonny outlaws them!QUICK UPDATE:  After a rather nasty ding incident today, I've found this handy little gadget is going to make me a multimillionaire!  Coming home this evening, I collided with the median wall, right where it runs under Northridge at Exit 6 on GA 400 southbound.  The beater caught fire, melting the asphalt on the road above, and putting that exit out of use for the next three weeks or so.  I thought I was for the high-junp until a friendly passing lawyer who now represents me pointed out that there's no warning *not* *to* *use* *this* *device* *while* *driving*!  We're going to sue these guys for millions!  Just like when I ate all that toner, thinking it was cajun spice.  Thanks very much, Laptop Steering Wheel Desk!  You're the best!

After years of rebuilding and cleaning carburetors on all of my small engines due to who knows what, I started putting these little fuel filters on everything.  I can't speak to the actual filtering ability of this device, but it is very compact and fits perfectly in 1/4" fuel lines.  I'm using this on a 2009 Honda Rebel and a 2013 Honda HRS2164PDA lawn mower.  It fits both, and the clear style looks great. I don't use any hose clamps and the hoses stay on just fine.

It's a little tricky to install you have to literally go under the outside of the rail. Not into the little slots of the seat rail go UNDER the rail and you'll feel it lock in place. Once that's locked the whole thing feels great.

Nice bulbs, but was a tight fit and required some bending and pushing.  They worked both ways and one bulb appeared fine initially, went dim after few tests and then back to FULL bright. Will update this review if the bulbs fail.1. They are about 4 times brighter than OEM bulbs. Not too bright, but don't think they are 300 Lumens as advertised.2. The light is WHITE.3. They worked fine both ways and with similar brightness.4. Auto dimming worked fine on both my cars (2004 & 2005).5. I noticed very dim light when OFF as reported as others. But issue didn't repeat. Will know in few days of use.6. Blew 3 FUSES when connecting the 3rd bulb. Remember to TURN OFF all lights in the circuit before changing one.7. No issues fitting the bulbs and not super big as some bulbs.

I got these for my 2016 Tacoma. The stock bulbs are pretty wimpy, and going to these is a BIG difference! Thanks to previous reviews the removal of the interior lights was fairly easy. I used the suggestion of, putting some tape on a screwdriver to get the round bulbs out of the socket. I forget if that was the map or vanity. Anyway there really isn't much room to work there, and this did get the job done. Use a very small screwdriver or plastic tool to remove the lens covers from the bottom. Go gentle. As for the tag lights. The ticket there is to get under the bumper and by pushing in on the plastic ears that secure the housing to the bumper, the whole housing can be pushed out onto the step area. I used two long screwdrivers. One to push in on one ear and the other to push out the housing. Piece of the cake. They just gently snap back in after the bulb is changed.

This tester works well on most cars and small engines.  The adapters make this tester very versatile.  What I like most about this tester is that the spark from a small engine is easily seen even in full sun.

I love this top. Now, I've only had it installed for a few days, so I can't speak on the longevity. The install  wasn't bad.  You essentially install all of the hardware, leave it lose, then tighten everything at the end.  I was in denial so I had to go back and loosen a few bolts, so, do what the install video says and leave them loose :-)I had a frame-less top before, one without door surrounds.  This top is vastly more quiet.  I LOVE having a rear window that flips up again without having to remove a bar, or bend over and pop back up on the inside to get my camping gear.The twill material is WAY better than whatever tops are usually made from. We'll see how it holds it's color after dusty trails and rain.I read the complaints about the rear wiper, I think they're unfounded.  It's a wiper, it wipes the glass.  They even put a nice heater/defroster under it in it's parked position like Subaru does. And, as far as the top falling down and blocking the rear view mirror, well, I haven't run it open yet, but it seems to me if you fold it correctly, and have the tension line hooked up correctly, it shouldn't be an issue.  And IF it did fall, you still have two side mirrors to get you pulled over.  I haven't seen out of my rear view in years anyway.

This light is cool but.....  it doesn't come with new screws and the originals aren't long enough. It also looked defective. It had a big glob of silicon on the top of the lens.  After scraping it with my nail I discovered it was just poor workmanship and not defective.

Not very bright at all, even at night. You have to look directory at the tiny LED bulbs for it to be considered bright. I wired this up correctly, 12v fused and I used a negative ground relayed output from my alarm. My alarm was going off very quietly. Long story short, this thing was shorting out and melting the outer housing. Took it out and everything is fine. I seriously doubt it was my installation, just a cheap China product.

There is a waviness in the material appearance which leads me to believe this is not the scotch guard pro ppf which i've read has cleared up that issue.  It went on well.  I used it to protect the name plate sills on in the door areas.  Use the material the same way you would with any PPF there are plenty of youtube videos of that just search for it.  The plate was already scratched so this is just preventing more from occurring and to allow me to learn how to put it on a car.

I use this winch for operating a snow plow on my pickup and have no complaints. The winch lifts the plow quickly and easily even when it has a decent amount of snow stuck to it. I removed the fairlead to keep the cable from fraying from the constant in and out with plow operation. Install was very straightforward, I am a mechanic but Im sure anyone who knows the basics of wiring could figure it out. I really liked that it came with the "handlebar switch" as well as the remote hook up. The "handlebar" switch is actually a "gearshift" switch in my application and I mounted the remote hook up on the front of the truck for hooking and unhooking the blade. Would buy this winch again if I had a need for another.

I picked these pedals for one reason. I'm not willing to give up $180 for a set of pedals.  They look good though.  I installed them on my 2016 Accord V6 6 speed manual coupe. These pedals were not made for the Accord but both the Clutch and Brake Pedals fit snug. The rough texture on the Brake and Clutch grip your shoes very well and have a very low chance of slippage. Since Honda made the Throttle Pedal Assembly out of plastic, the rubber cover cannot be removed and is actually stuck to the pedal.  The pedals came with 4 screws which I was able to use to mount the Throttle Pedal to the rubber top.  Kind of wish it was a little wider so it fully covers the Original Pedal. A bit of rash on the pedals here and there but only saw it on the back on the Pedals.

First off- the product delivered fast and it is solid steel. However, I bought the 2 front leveling spacer because the pre-measurements were exactly 2 diff from ground to fender. Well, not the case when you install. Now the front measures 1 higher than the rear and makes the vehicle look like sag in the rear. By the whole kit when you purchase, not just the front and get a front end alignment when you do so!

Update: I received a new one free of charge, so I upgraded them to 3 stars, the hassle was still very annoying. You are paying a premium, it's unacceptable that there should be any flaws.First off, I must say the carbon fiber is amazing on this piece, looks great way better than the cheap knock offs.Unfortunately I had to give this product a 2 stars. AFTER I installed the carbon fiber lid I noticed there was something "inside" the carbon fiber. It looks like a dead bug or something. It is literally inside the carbon fiber and unfortunately I didn't noticed it until it was already installed. I contacted the company but they never responded back. I really like the product but this is a $40 sticker and I expected top quality control since I was paying top dollar... All in all I like the product, but their quality control was terrible and their lack of customer service was even worse. So they get 2 stars...If you order this item make sure you inspect if thoroughly before installing. I wished I had.Pictures, I took a picture of the product before opening up (took it to post on my FB wall) and you can kinda see the imperfection in the photo (although it's hard to see) I have a close up photo of the imperfection. I wished they would of refunded or replaced it or something..

I'm surprised how many people complain about the color of this steering wheel cover... I guess I just don't care enough about the color. It is gray. Light gray. There are many shades of gray... they didn't lie, and everybody's computer screen displays colors slightly differently. But it is gray.One review did remark how difficult it is to install - which I will second. I think, again, your mileage may vary because some steering wheels are bigger, or have odd shapes or curvatures. Again - not something you'll be able to tell for yourself until you actually try it out. On my beater 1998 Rodeo, though, it was a chore to install.Which brings me to the meat of this review. My Rodeo has a hard, cold, plastic steering wheel which absolutely sucks the heat out of my hands. On my 1.8 mile commute in the middle of winter, my hands get so cold that it's painful - so I bought the cheapest steering wheel cover I could find that would actually insulate my hands. And it does this VERY well. It's very comfortable to drive with this cover on and I would normally recommend it for that reason. However, it's not the prettiest thing (even if it did match my car) and the smell was rather strong for the first few weeks I had it in the car. At least it masked the smell of wet dog from the previous owners!All that said, I am astonished that no one else bothered to comment on the fact that this thing has a bold warning on the cardboard it was attached to: "This product contains chemicals, including lead, known to the State of California to cause cancer and/or birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling this product."Wow. Now I normally think the State of California warnings are sometimes over the top, but this one is almost funny. They want me to wash my hands after handling this product? So after every time I drive anywhere? Riiiight. Good thing I don't really take much heed from those warnings! But, I know there are those who might, so I thought it might be a good idea to share that. I'll post a picture of the cardboard as well.So, in summary, it stinks like burned rubber, it's tough to install, might not be precisely the shade of gray you're looking for, and it may cause cancer. But it's nice to feel on the hands and keeps my hands warm! It's on my beater car, which I don't drive very often... I'll keep it on the wheel (if only because it'll be a nightmare to take off). 3 stars.Update 18 Dec 2011: Some sharp wires started sticking out of the steering wheel cover which were most definitely uncomfortable while driving, and potentially dangerous. I've deducted another star and removed the wheel cover from my Rodeo in favor of a store-bought one.

Simply put, most performance car manufacturers use this oil straight from the factory and that is for good reason, it has the best makeup, and best oil analysis results of any oil that is currently on the market.  Now you could go to any forum and ask questions about oil and you are going to get 100 responses, each recommending a different oil, each with their own reason why their choice is the best.  Honestly, the best thing you can do for your engine is to run a particular oil, and do an oil analysis to see the wear and viscosity numbers.  In my engine, this oil provided the lowest number of wear metals, and the most stable number for viscosity.  Pair that up with great protection at hotter temperatures (which is something that I need for my RX8's rotary engine), and also fantastic cold flow for the winter, and you have an all-year oil that performs just as well as it protects.  Give this oil a shot, get some oil analysis done (Blackstone Labs), and see for yourself!

Purchased to replace the stock yellow H11 halogens on my MK7 Golf (non-GTI). Easy swap with plenty of clearance. I know some people have complained about the size of certain aftermarket LED bulbs. Build quality and packaging seem to be that of a well-equipped company, so let's hope these bulbs stand true to that impression.As some reviews have stated, the light output on these bulbs are not as good as their OEM lights. That's because these aren't produced to be headlights. Many of the poor reviews are from people who don't understand what this product is for. These bulbs are for DRLs or secondary lighting and their purpose is aesthetic, not to light up the road. OPT7 makes an entirely different headlight appropriate product if you're looking for light output.Also, here in the southwest we don't get fog, so I'm not concerned about the fog lights being less useful. For you VW fans, I also used VAGCOM to modify the fog light coding to stay on during the daytime with the headlight DRLs. Looks great!Included is a photo referencing the OEM halogen compared to the OPT7 LED.

I like these LEDs ive used AGT too an think these may actually be a little better than AGT. Ive never gotten a faulty zonetech led and I've ordered probably more than 30leds from them too. Ordered 10 from AGT before and 1/10didnt work out the box, also 3/10 AGT seemed to fail premature for no reason.Meanwhile i haven't had really had zonetechs going out on me at all in over 2 years. Ive also found that new Pilot Leds at Walmart and autozone are very nice i have Pilot 15led each bulbs in each of these 6 bulbs in my tailights uncluding turnsignals.

good kit.  one of the air bags had a leak upon initial installation.  Contacted manufacturer and they said "ohh yeah it's leaking from the brass insert at the top, where it bolts to the bracket isn't it?"  Apparently this is an issue.  I disassembled it to find the cause.  The reason they leak is the supplied air bag-to-bracket bolts are too long and crack the plastic at the bottom of the hole (brass insert in top) cracking it, causing a massive leak.  They sent me a new bag rapidly with no problems. just be aware.  USE SHORTER BOLTS.  FYI: The new bag they sent me had shorter bolts.

This really beats having to drive around un-safely without something holding the coupler latch, or to have to stick a padlock on the coupler latch and fiddle with it when you want to un-hitch.There is an 'un-chained' version which is just the pin without chain, but I lost that because I have a habit of mis-placing things.  So, I bought this one with a plan....See my photo as attached.  My suggestion is - if you can't bolt the chain on easily, I just get a small length of plastic coated wire rope and loop it around with the safety pin's chain, so you can never lose it!

I am pleased with the mats for my vehicle. They were bent up when they arrived and stapled together at the top but in 24 hours they flattened out. The staple left holes that were less than pleasant but you're unable to see the holes when in the vehicle so it's not that big of an issue. It takes away from the quality of the product to staple it together though... All in all, I like them. They work great at keeping my car floor clean during rain and (presumably) snow.I received this product at a discount for an unbiased and honest review.

For what these are used for, they are great!A friend of mine purchased a set from weatherteach (1-130$) and these are the EXACT same thing but saves you 40$ They do there job.At times i find myself having to walk through grass to and from work, and yes, my z is a daily runner. I used to run stock oem carpets and plastic/rubber mats but they don't always work..These ones are CUPPED. So any spillage of liquid aren't going to soak in. But do be aware that a massive spillage such as a 2 liter soda will make it pass these mats due to the two pin holes. Cleaning is easy. Vacuum, take out and beat em, or just take em off and give em a good spray of water would suffice. I recommend them.As for 6mt owners of the Z. You bad boys have the clutch pedal so i don't know if this will fit them. Maybe minor modification needed?Attached are photos of the mats

Bought for my 98 Jeep Wrangler TJ as an emergency cover for this summer when I take the doors and top off.  Doesn't fit perfect (the mirror holes are useless for me), but I personally don't care.  It is for emergency when those rain squalls hit here in Northern Nevada.  Material is decent and is soft on the inside.  Straight on the sides and fitted at the ends.  Has reflective orange on the corners. Only has 2 hooks in the front and back, but I made it work.

Two years ago, I bought and installed these for my 04 Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab. They still look as if they were brand new.Let me just say.. I pay a monthly car wash subscription, and go very frequently to ensure I get my money's worth. It is NOT a touchless car wash. The cloth pieces are wet, and spin very fast. They beat the living hell out of my truck two to three times a week, every week.First time was an accident, because my reason for this purchase was from shattering the previous visors.. going through the same car wash, ironically. Do the math, and that's approximately 300 washes these visors have endured.The only negative thing I can point out is that the edges are very sharp. I cut my finger deeply thumping a cigarette out while it was raining. That was my own negligence. If you have kids, you may want to rub a 1500 grit piece of sand paper along the edge. Carefully.. or you may lose a finger doing it.5 star all across the board.

These cabin air filters are great OEM replacements for my 2006 Mazda RX8 (AT transmission). Two rectangular filters come in the pack and both are used when changing out the cabin air filter. Due to size constraints the filter had to be broken down into two halves so it can be inserted into the compartment that they are stored in. In the 2006 Mazda RX8 this compartment is behind the glove box tray. You simply remove the tray, slide the old filter halves out, and put the new ones in.There is a video on youtube that goes over the process of changing the filter. The title of the video is: Cabin air filter replacement- Mazda RX-8.Pros:*OEM spec*Easy to installCons:*NoneAdditional Considerations:Be aware, the cabin air filter is different from the engine air filter. So if a mechanic mentions that your air filter needs to be changed make sure the mechanic specifies which air filter.Overall: 5/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 5 starsIf you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

You get what you pay for. No dents or chips on mine. Just when I was installing it it didn't quite line up. Luckily with a lot of force I was able to make it happen. It came with a little protection underneath from the paint but not enough

First off... no instructions. I'll post some pics to try and help.The product did work, but took some effort. I actually had to cut off about 5 threads length of the stock mirrors. I did this instead of using a ton of washers, which i thought would look bad.Also the screws supplied took two different Alan wrenches. Thought that was weird, but they worked.Final product looks decent. For a cheap fix it will work. $16 is a lot better than $90 for HD long mirrors.

I ordered these bulbs for the DRL/brights on my 15 Santa Fe. I can't go with LED's because the DRL voltage is only 2vdc and when the brights are activated the same bulb gets a full 12vdc. LED's look great but are not functional for use as brights. I have attached a photo of the stock (left) and diamond bulb (right).  In the photo it doesn't look tremendously whiter than the stock bulb but it is whiter with a hint of blue. For some reason the diamond bulb doesn't seem as bright as the stock bulb when both are shining on the garage wall but I will add more to this review once I use them for a week or so. The strange thing is that the diamond bulb looks exactly like the stock bulb just with some blue paint on the tip. If the diamond bulb is just a pure white I can help but wonder why they don't just sell the diamond bulb without the blue tint on the tip if its that much brighter and whiter.

If you are like me and are looking for grab handles that don't say "Wild Boar" the OPAR version I got is what you're looking for. The text just says OPAR with a small TM, much better than the several dozen other product links that are the "Wild Boar" one which is silly. The handles themselves are very sturdy, and it only took me about 20 minutes total to install but be patient yourself.

I purchased this set of JDM ASTAR 194 led  bulbs on 6/28/2017 and received the bulbs on 6/30/2017.  However, I did not install these led bulbs until recently (February 2018), one bulb was flickering, so I replaced it with another bulb.  The second bulb lasted 2 days and had a burnt mark (like a short) on the bulb.  Needless to say, I am disappointed with the bulbs (even though I did not have any problems with my previous purchases of JDM ASTAR led bulbs.  These are suppose to be premium led bulbs and are priced as such (2 led bulbs for $12.99).Fortunately, the bulbs are warranted for one year...now I am finding out from the Amazon website that I cannot get replacements for my defective bulbs because Amazon does not know when or if they will ever be back in stock.

I have only had this light all of 4 days and it has now cost $100's in damage when it decided to fly off the car roof scraping and denting my roof before the cord snapped and it landed on the berm.

fyi Each compressor draws over 15 amps so make sure you are wiring with correct gauge wire (at least 14 gauge) and definitely use the included 30 amp relay. Overtime I may find that EACH compressor will need its own relay because my feeling is that the initial amp-surge could burn the relays contacts, but time will tell.I would suggest, ON EACH COMPRESSOR, to remove the three screws which will expose the pump's impeller system, and you should saturate it with some quality silicon spray lubricant.  I would repeat this lubrication process at least once a year unless you're a heavy honker.NOTE: The hole in the side of the black plastic piece labeled "OIL" really does nothing.Mount the compressors so you can easily lubricate these throughout it's future.In my installation, I had to mount the horns about 4 feet away so I used 1/4" I.D. clear braided tubing from HDepot.Included hardware is not stainless steel so you may, like I did, pickup some instead.The Sound: awfully close to the ones on a fire truck.Only gave 4 stars because hardware should have been stainless steel as this is an outdoor device.

Updated 10/20/17: i was contacted by the seller to try the new model after i purchased the original model in the past.  Got the new model and they have made a lot of improvements based off all the negative review of the original. This updated version now the walls stand rigid where in the past they would collapse.  The handles seem to be stitched better this time.  I put some thing in this time around and it was able to hold them and not rip the handle like the first model.  Seems like they listened to everyone and this model is way better than the original.Original post: So I got this hoping it would be of quality, I was sadly mistaken.  The handles broke with the first use of picking it up.  I was well under the limit but its just cheaply made.  The picture definitely misleading as well.  it shows a nice rigid organizer, what you get is a floppy organizer that only stays open if it has something in it.  wouldn't suggest this buy for anyone

I've had other tailgate assist cylinders before but this one is the best one so far.  The tailgate on my 2018 Silverado used to drop like a lead balloon but now it is smooth and takes about 5 seconds to go down.  Installation is very easy and only takes a few minutes.  The only issue is the installation of the blind nut.  Even following the instructions exactly I had to re-tighten the nut several times to get it to stop rotating.  A minor issue that was easily overcome.

Absolutely fantastic headlight, it has been working rain or shine as a single motorcycle headlight for months. No problems at all. Very comparable to my friend's expensive, complicated, and failure-prone dual HID bulb kit.Note that the light won't fit in just any standard 7" housing - it is much larger and deeper than a standard bulb's housing. I tried several enclosures, but the one that worked was off of a 92 Suzuki GS 500 (many other suzuki models use this same headlight, however), as much of the bike's wiring is designed to be stuffed into it - not the case with my vehicle, a Suzuki Bandit, where all of the spare wiring was tucked into the space between the engine and the downtube. Due to its increased weight versus normal projectors, it was also required that I swap out and reinforce all of the screws inside of the headlight enclosure. Note the stainless allen bolts with locking washers and nylock nuts. The unsecured screws that are simply threaded through taps are insufficient due to the weight involved. So after that modification and some mounting putty added for dampening, I have an extremely reliable, bright, and good-looking headlight set up, for an extremely low price. My friend's comparable HID set up has cost about 600 dollars in troubleshooting with different ballasts, wiring kits, bulbs, etc. I've got a rock-solid set up for about $250, all told.

Afe won't tell you this so I will. Afe's answer to me after multiple emails back and forth was that their R&D department did not test all factory configurations or options that Ford may install on there trucks. Bottom line if you're Ford F-250, 350 came with a factory installed sway bar or you plan on installing one on your truck this product will not fit. Attached is a photo showing why, as the axel moves the sway bar will make contact with Afe's cover even with no weight in the bed. If you put load or hook up a trailer the sway bar will come to rest on the cover. The photo attached was taken when the truck was hitched to a goose neck horse trail about 700 pounds at the hitch. As you can see it not a good situation to have a sway bar banging against your axel cover. To boot Afe did not even give warning on their about this problem thus I'm giving Afe one star even though it's high quality pumpkin cover.

I've went back to my other helmet that i have until i can get this one exchanged for (hopefully) a XXL. I bought a medium and a XL, med for my gf. Hers fits good. Anything after medium you better order the next size up. Thehelmets ARE loud when doing 55 mph or over.** Solid, light weight, strong, and fits very well. Has a vent in the top controlled by a small finger roller.  GREAT color too.  If this is a first time buying a helmet, to make sure it fits right, when its on and secured with the strap under the chin, shake your head up and down and side to side a cpl of times. If the helmet stays put, and doesnt feel uncomfortable, then its the right size. If it doesnt stay put when shaking your head, its too big and will not do you much good when riding.  (Btw, don't ever buy a used helmet, just because it LOOKS like its never been dropped or involved in an accident doesnt mean it hasnt. Manufacturers warranty is void if its a used helmet)  There is a good amount of padding that IS able to be removed if you need just a bit more room for comfort. It just snaps right out and in. Over all, for the price? SCORE! watch the video im including in this review for a bit more info.

Worked perfectly in my 2009 Mercedes Benz CLK 350. These are amazing! Bright blue-white light. I replaced the burned-out bulb and it made the remaining incandescent look a dim yellow by comparison - so I replaced it as well. These are almost as bright as my low beams creating excellent close-up illumination.

I though "smoke" color would be darker, but it is 90%+ Also, the screw holes didn't line up.Tha said, it easily cleared the inner dome and appeared to be of very high quality. It didn't come with screws or sealant, so it was good I bought them at the same time.

I ordered these for my 2009 Jeep Wrangler. Based on price and prior reviews, I was not expecting a superior product or a perfect fit obviously since they're universal fit. They have been installed on my jeep for over a week now and I am very happy with them. They are true to color; a nice dark black and a bright happy yellow. They do not fit perfectly, they are a tiny bit too small for the 2 front seats in my jeep, but that's okay. They don't effect function at all. I drive around with them every day.The material is very thin. These would not protect from liquid spills or stains. But it's been sturdy enough to withstand the wear and tear of getting in and out of the jeep every day. They protect my seats from the sun and abrasion wear which is all that I wanted, so I am happy. These are not super high quality, so if you want something like that look elsewhere. If you just want to change up the look of your car or protect from sun bleaching and wear and tear, these are perfect.

Arrived on time, the stainless looks amazing.  Feel beefy and built with good quality.  I read some reviews about rust and the key breaking, I'll come back and edit this review if I experience any problems.  As of right now these are perfect.  Fit exactly right in my Nissan Maxima 2017, just like factory; flush with the wheel.  I applied 100 lbs. with my torque wrench, the nut and the key seemed pretty sturdy.  The packaged comes with stickers inside to order replacement parts/key, make sure to put this in your glove box or something just in case.

Great step bar.  Fits my 2016 4Runner perfectly and looks great, in my opinion.The description is correct so this item is not exactly as depicted by the stock photo.  When I purchased the photo showed a gloss finish with a sticker.  The finish is a textured mat black and there is no sticker.  The finish appears to a material similar to spray-in bed-liner, although certainly not as thick as some spray-in liners.Installation took about 25 minutes with a ratchet and two sockets.  The slotted holes lined up perfectly and allow for about 1 inch of travel front to back.  The bars are sturdy but not overly heavy so if you do what the manufacturer suggests and start with the middle bracket, installation will be a breeze.For me these step bars are perfect because the step is closer to the front of the door which allows me to climb in easier without the step getting in the way when I exit (when I don't use the step).Note:  The instructions reference the Toyota Tacoma but they were spot on for installation on my 4Runner.  I'm finding that a lot of parts are interchangeable which makes sense, but it did throw me for a loop when I first noticed the heading.

The Curt 13002 received did not fit. The weld nuts on my 2014 Cadillac SRX bumper did not line up with the bolt holes of the hitch.Curt Mfg sent a replacement a few days later and the replacement had the same issue. The first hitch was manufactured 25 Jan 2016 the second 22 Jan 2016. If you are considering putting a Curt 13002 on your 2014, check the manufacturer date on the sticker on the end of the hitch. If it's dated Jan 2016, do yourself a favor and measure the weld nut locations and compare them to the hitch before wrestling the hitch into the tight gap between the frame rails.Seller sent a postage due return label to send the hitch back to Curt Mfg. It will cost me $33 for the 27 pound package.The weight of 5lbs listed on this site is off by 22 pounds.

Great fit on my Honda Pioneer 700-4. Mounts high enough on center roll bar to not block view for rear seat passengers.  Installed easily and seems to be well manufactured of heavy style canvas with small to large size pockets, and the large fleece lined center pocket decribed as the binocular pocket.  Certainly large enough for a full sized pair of binoculars, or other valuables that need additional padding.  Zippers well constructed, and once tightened, open easily with one hand.  Installation was pretty simple, with lots of strap left for larger width vehicles. Center mount with two heavy Velcro flaps that fit over bar, and two strap mounts on each side. Nice addition of clips to attach excess  for a clean looking installation. Highly recommend this cargo bag.  One comment to add, - I have a rear view mirror mounted on the front roll bar - II discovered with the placement of this cargo bag in the center bar it makes that mirror useless.  I re-mounted this around the front roll bar, and found it does not interfere with the view.  Makes it actually easier to access.  I put some extensions on the mirror mounts, works even with Honda hard roof.

I don't normally post lengthy reviews, but considering it took me nearly an hour to install this shift knob I figured I'd share the experience. First and foremost, I would have given 5 stars had I not had to fabricate this product to work on my 4Runner. Unlike a manual transmission shift lever, an automatic shifter has less than half the diameter, so the knob looks stupid as it is too large and the screws are too short to secure to the shift lever. I would have gladly paid more if this thing came with alternate metal attachments for different diameter levers. If you use this on an auto transmission, remove the plastic/metal looking piece from the factory shift knob and super glue to the metal one provided. The pic says it all

This is the best quality light polish and wax that you can use after using heavier compounds to remove scratches. A single wax and polish with M66 using my DA orbital and blue pad will last almost a full year. When polishing/cutting, this should be your last step in a 3-4 stage process. I use all Mirror Glaze products. Polish creates shine, not wax.

I would definitely recommend Supreme Suspensions. I ordered the 2 inch lift for my Ram 1500 4x4. The kit wasn't too hard to put on. I did it myself in a couple of hours with pretty basic tools. The ride of the vehicle stayed very smooth. My camber didn't move too far away from stock. Ive had this lift on for a while now and am very glad I installed it.

I have the Bolt Hood Lock installed on my 2014 Jeep Wrangler and went to install this and I couldn't get the grille reattached along the bottom. There's a metal bracket with holes along the bottom and it was in the way and part of the mesh on the right side interfered with some electronic component on the jeep. I was going to return it but instead I trimmed the mesh along the right then trimmed off the metal bracket on the bottom using tin snips. I have it installed now but the hole isn't big enough for me to get my finger in and pull off the hood lock cover along the top. So I had to use my key to take the cover off. I took the cover off and there's a short rubber piece connected to the bottom that keeps the cover attached, so I pulled that to release the slack and now the lock cover will not completely seal. I'm now debating about taking the mesh off and getting inserts. I obviously can't return the bug screen since I had to modify it. $60 down the drain.Update 5/20/16 I cut out the ring and trimmed around it and can now get the lock cover on and off easier than before.

One downside is that there is definitely more vibration in the car. I feel like the entire car is more bouncy. Instructions were half way good. YouTube videos helped a lot. You will need a socket Allen Hex socket with extension to reach one of the bolts. You may also need PB blaster to ease removal of existing bolts. Great upgrade!

Excellent light. I purchased as an additional stop light on my bike to increase visibility. I noticed cars don't follow not stop as close to me anymore. When I tested this it lit up the street quite bright. But due to autofocus I couldn't take a picture to show it.Pros:1. Thin, well made2. "Blinding" bright3. Price is perfect4. Screws have caps so they are not visible when installed.Cons:1. The post on the back is longer than it needs to be so it cannot be mounted on flat surfaces. The surface to mount needs a hole in order to have it flushed. I knew I needed to do modifications since it's a custom mod I used it for so it didn't bother me.2. It does not come with wire diagram so you will need to do some testing.3. If you have electrical knowledge the wires are not color coded conventionallywhite = ground, black=low voltage (running light), red=high voltage (break light).4. Screw caps arePermanent. LEDs are cheap and so it's the light. I don't think people are out stealing trailer lights.

After looking at them all I picked this one because it's the best shape and fit for my '99. Now, installed I can see I was right. It looks cool and no trimming required.The only think is the mounting hardware. So what comes with it...nope. It wouldn't work at all on mine and even if it had it would be way too flimsy for my liking (the screws are plastic.) So, as others have said your two options are:1) Sheet metal screws (get ones that are small enough they can't go through into your upper hood and do NOT try and drill a pilot unless you have a small bit that again, will not go through the outside of your hood.2) Get some plastic pop rivets! I found some at Ace that only needed minor trimming on the sides and they work awesome! After I installed it with four of these I didn't even bother with the sheet metal screws. (See pics of pop tab below.)For piece of mind, when the hood is down I don't think it could come off but still...go with a better mounting option than what comes with it.So, even though you really do have to figure out a better mounting option it's still the best shaped visor out there and considering the price it's not too big of a deal to do a little work on the mounts.

Don't listen to the people who tell you this will clog your MAFS. When cleaning and reapplying the oil simply follow the instructions and you won't have a problem. Turbo is louder, acceleration is a little easier and its a lifetime part. Was a lot slimmer and in turn more breathable which equals more power.

Amazon.com was the most affordable price I could find on a RV specific EPDM roof coating. All other brands out there are much more pricey or are not legitimately compatible with an EPDM rubber roof. The product came with a bottle of catalyst which must be added to the paint and stirred thoroughly before using. It recommends using a drill with paint mixer to make sure its mixed thoroughly. Follow the indicated application instructions, or research on internet ([...] Scrape any flaking of previous coating. Scrub roof surface thoroughly with deck brush and bleach/water/powder detergent mixture, rinse with water, and allow to air dry. Patch any rips/tears/holes in rubber with Eternabond tape (this stuff is awesome!). Touch up sealant around vents, skylights, antennas, and molding with Dicor Lap Sealant (self-leveling for flat surfaces and non-leveling for edges). Check weather for appropriate temperature and at least 2 days without moisture (dew, rain). Mix paint and paint roof edges and around all fixtures with 2inch brush. Then starting at the front of RV, dump paint on surface, quickly spread evenly with squeegee (so fast!), and roll out with paint roller. Keep working back and finish at the ladder. Allow to dry & cure for 2 days. 2 cans was plenty for one coat on a 27ftx8ft RV. Maintain surface by cleaning annually with bleach/water/detergent (do not use deck brush) and checking for rips/tears/holes. Reapply coating every 5 years. Only negative for me was darn bugs landing on it when it was wet and now I have bug "fossils".

Let me just say I've bought many many many led automotive lights in the last few years about $1500 on Amazon to your local autozone and these are the best by far and at a fair price. I've never been satisfied with led tail light mainly because the distinction between tail light and brake is not very good meaning if you have the tail lights on and you hit the brakes the brightest is not noticeable enough to catch someone's eyes and here in Phoenix AZ were people text and drive at 80+ mph and have absolutely no effin skills in the driving department..  brake lights are important. And these bad boys are awesome you can tell the difference big time. These are the 4th order through JDM led and when they say bright golly they mean it. Don't wast your money on autozone or those like brands. If you care about seeing and being seen I'd recommend these. Totally buying Amber led for the rear turn and switchbacks for the front from JDM very happy.The picture of the tail lights - Left is led - Right is incandescent. While in the picture does it no justice they truly are brighter, fills the whole light housing with light no dark spots. Picture of the bulb out is a better comparison of tail and brake function

What GREAT mirrors at an amazingly low price! I love this so much. I've been using my old mirrors so much and these mirrors were just a huge quality increase. I'm so happy with these mirrors. VERY easy to put on, VERY easy to adjust and they don't move when I drive high speeds like my old mirrors did. Get these. I will recommend to all my friends w 10mm mirrors.

These are a quick, easy (5 minute install) for your 2008-2010 Challenger that came with the hood prop instead of struts.  The nipple is already on the hood, and the threaded hole is in the fender.  Snap on to the hood, install the one in the fender, done.

The hex pad design is cool.  It reduces sling and is easy to clean.  It comes with a pad cleaning solution which is probably just a citrus scented multipurpse cleaner. I only really use three of the pads. There have specific recommended uses, but there are overall two pads each for Correction, Polish, and Wax/Sealant.

For the price this is a fantastic upgrade to the useless cup holders in the E39 BMW, the unit has a slightly more plastic quality that the rest of the material in the car but does not look bad. It is very functional and may not even need to be doubled taped to the car as it fits in fairly snuggly.Good buy for under twenty bucks.

I purchased this Petronix to replace a older unit. I have has no issues with the one installed I just wanted to replace before it would fail. When I received it I noticed that the Mylar tape that is on the magnet  had a edge that was a bit pealed but I did not think much of it. I had good gaps between the modules and was no interference. After 3 months of trouble free driving, this moring my car would not start. After trouble shooting everything I found the spark, so I removed the distributor and found the Mylar wrapped around the distributor shaft . The magnets were all scattered around the distributor. I thought I can reinstall the magnets and get it running again but ended up finding out that the module had been damaged. I have never seen this before. I have used Petronix for years but I was very diisapointed with this one.

After installation, I experienced cabin air gush (running the AC fan full speed) I have not experience since having the vehicle 7 years ago. I can actually feel the air gush in my face sitting relaxed back-to-seat (running A/C fan full speed). However, from the dirt in the filter, I conclude the filter has never been changed since original 10 years ago (See the pictures). BTW, I never know there was filter underneath the dash - I found this out from Amazon recommendation (Thank you Amazon! Where has my mechanics being - they never mentioned the filter!?)

I really enjoyed giving my car a foam bath. Paired with Chemical Guys Maxi-Suds II, this product was a blast. Its like the super soaker of foam. The quick release neck makes for a speedy rinse - go from foam to water in no time. After 15 minutes of elbow grease, I had a nicely cleaned ride. Even after drying the car, I was able to control the foam spray with finesse and target just the wheels for a wheel cleaning without hitting the rest of my ride. Needless to say, I won't be visiting the detailers any time soon.Instructions too technical? It takes less than 30 seconds to assemble the Foam Master - see the youtube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5FQ8RmTyCs

This is my second purchase of these lights. The first time I bought 4 to put on the front bumper of my truck (1 on the driver corner pointing at 11 o'clock, 2 centered at 12 o'clock, and 1 on the passenger corner at 1 o'clock). They worked great but after about 2 months, one had moisture building up inside and eventually stopped working. I bought this set of 2 to replace the messed up one and to have a spare. They need silicon around the lenses. If I have more problems I will be buying a more reputable brand to replace all 4 lights.

Fantastic shampoo. Worked really well with my Chemical Guys foam cannon and SunJoe electric pressure washer (2000psi). Left a thick coat of foam that stuck to the paint well, got into gaps, and dragged all the dirt off with the rinse. Ultra-thick foam, needed to be really heavily rinsed. Leaves a good base coat to build off of with a Quick Detailer and/or liquid/paste wax.

These are OEM parts.  100% plastic (black) but OEM.  I would have given five stars if the instructions had been included.  I DID find instructions online after a bit of searching.They fit 2017 Toyota RAV4 LE perfectly.  Cost much less than at my local Toyota dealership.They were easy to install after I read the instructions over twice to be sure. I am attaching photos to show details of installation. You will need a 10mm socket, 8mm socket, nut driver handle (don't use ratchet), and a really long #2 phillips screwdriver. If you are lost after reading this far, you can't put these on by yourself.They arrived quickly and in good condition.  Hardware included.Caution: You will be screwing into plastic. Don't over tighten hardware or you will strip out the plastic on your car.I installed them in under an hour.  Marked the little dimples with a light colored paint spot so I could see it better.  Photos kind of tell the installation story.

4 stars bcuz the mounting holes are farther apart than the original holes. I redrilled 2 holes on the stem bracket and mounted it to the trailer. I mounted the receiver bracket to the door and redrilled 2 holes in the door. I replaced the plumber's putty and all screws with #10x1" sheet metal screws for a more secure fit. Very satisfied.

Roll came all bent, squared off instead of a round roll, which looks like it will cause it to be much more difficult to install. It has creases in it. Also I have purchased other rolls and this one was inside out, as if someone had unrolled it and then rolled it up the wrong way. Very disappointing as it was a nice day to install.

This is Honda's genuine power steering fluid. I have noticed that the PS Pump in my '08 Honda Accord started to whine, especially, in colder weather. In addition, it was harder and harder to turn the steering wheel when standing still or parking. I purchased 3 bottles of PS, and did the change the easy way by using a Turkey Baster, without disconnecting the hoses. The Reservoir's capacity is around 1/3 of the total PS System's capacity, and therefore, by refilling 3 times, I got about 2/3 of the PS Fluid changed, however, I avoided the risk of running the PS Pump dry by doing it this way instead of the full system flush, and saving money along the way.My car has about 60K miles, and the PS Fluid was very dark (the new one is almost colorless). I couldn't believe how better the PS has become -- no whining sounds even when the system is cold, and much easier to turn the wheels.

There are two large magnets attached to the bottom of the tray that protrude about 1/2 below the tray. This cant be seen in any of the pictures but makes the tray unstable when put on any surface. The magnets are cheap and don't actually hold much for their size. Dont waste you money on this tray.

This cover may be a good deal and it looked good. However it did not fit my winch at all. (Badlands ( Harbor Freight) 5,000 lb winch)Had to send it back. The specs said: 18 x 9 x 10 inches, However I found that it was barely 11 inch wide.  So while great service and no questions asked when I send it back, it still disappointed since I now still have no cover at all. Very Frustrating

Second go round and I had the same problem!!. Strut bracket that holds the brake line was bent badly and I had to put the wrench/screwdriver to it to get it to line up with the brake line. Aaaaaaaand, the passenger side strut blew out and punched a hole in my hood!! Never heard of anything like that before!! It's the cheapest strut to put on a car that's almost 12 years old and has 260k miles on it. Only reason I bought them is because I don't want to invest a lot of money into an old car.

I recently purchased a certified pre-owned 2013 Wrangler 2-door. I need to pull a 16' speedboat weighing about 1200lbs. The dealer wanted over $200 for the hitch set-up, so I opted to shop around Amazon before accepting their offer. Found this one for just under $60 that looked pretty much the same as the dealer issue, so I went for it. In regard to the installation, it took about an hour, but more time was spent getting the wrenches, droplight and creeper out than the actual installation time itself. The kit carton was sealed with all hardware within plastic envelopes or wrapped in foam. There was NO instruction sheet whatsoever, so it must have been a mfg oversight, but because this is such a simple product to install, reading other reviews and videos filled in any technical gaps. For instance, I took the advice of another reviewer to crazy glue the washers to the hitch on the nut side of the assy. This helped for 3 out of 4 of them. One fell off due to the weld line of the connector holder, but was not a big issue. I used Knipex slip joint plyers to hold the nuts to get them started. Knipex are similar to Channelocks, but the jaws are thinner which was easier to fit between the frame and the bumper. I used a torque wrench to tighten to 80 ft/lbs, but this became a little bit of a challenge due to the angle I was at under the vehicle and how to hold the open end wrench and torque wrench at the same time. For the 2 nuts toward the driver's side, I simply let the open end wrench turn with the nuts until they contacted the hitch itself, and used it as stop to counteract the torque wrench. On the 2 nuts toward the passenger side, there was nothing to stop the wrench from turning, so I used a screwdriver placed under the bumper and frame to stop the open end wrench from turning. I included a photo of this technique. In regard to the wiring kit, I had a slight issue with the lights malfunctioning. This was an oversight on my part with the connectors. Being over careful, I was concerned with pushing them together too hard in fear of breakage. I late found out that they really need to be pushed together, so I used my Knipex plyers. I heard a click from both connectors, which it was what they supposed to do. All lights worked perfectly. The wire tubing has 4 push stays that are pushed into pre-existing holes in the frame, so no zip-ties are necessary. All served to provide a factory-like installation of both the hitch and the wiring kit.

I've had this for a few weeks and have used it numerous times to navigate around Brevard County Florida. So far the maps (which I updated right after getting the GPS) have been spot on except for one time when I was in a wildlife conservation area (that neither Google or Bing maps has either) which wasn't mapped but it's dirt dikes in a swamp and not part of city, county or state roads. Amusingly the Garmin map did show the lakes I was driving around just not the dirt roads.I've downloaded and tried several of the voices offered for the Garmin nvi 50LM though the only ones I've used have been the TTS voices (those that actually speak the street names). After several trials I've found, oddly enough, that the voice 'British English - Serena' is the clearest and easiest to understand.The 5" screen is great. The display is crisp and clear and can easily be read from a distance. The touch screen is quite responsive. I don't feel like I have to pound on the screen to make selections. I have mine mounted in an&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Arkon-GN047-Removable-Air-Vent-Mount/dp/B0015A6YN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Arkon GN047 Removable Air Vent Mount</a>&nbsp;in the passenger side center console air vent to keep it off the windshield and out of the Florida sun. {See uploaded photo.}While this is a basic GPS unit the nvi 50LM does what a GPS unit is designed to, get you from Point-A to Point-B (options for this are Faster Time, Shorter Distance or Off Road (straight line navigation)) without any extra, distracting, bells and whistles it still has some nice options:* Lifetime free map updates.* Maps can be displayed in 2D or 3D.* You can change the level of map display information shown.* You can turn on or off Map Data Layout information which adds driving direction, time of day, elevation and speed to the main map display.* The icon for your vehicle can be changed. Garmin themselves offer numerous icons to download and there are also places on the internet to download custom vehicle icons.* Automatic switching between day and night display settings.* Lane Assist & Junction View helps you (in some areas) get in the correct lane ahead of time.* Millions of Points of Interest plus the ability to add your own favorite destinations.So far I really like my Garmin nvi 50LM and enjoy using it. It's made getting out and about a lot easier than paper maps ever did.I'll update this review, if necessary, if any durability issues arise over time. For now, this is one of my favorite pieces of technology.

Installation was easy, though I did use waterproof heat-shrinkable connectors instead of the included twist type connectors. I'm glad I went with the low profile style. I wish the license plate bracket had holes for the smaller license plates, but it wasn't a big deal to drill them. They're much brighter than the old lights and if they're actually submersible, I'll be really happy. I'll probably replace my other boat trailers with these lights as well. For the price, it's a great upgrade.

If your looking at this product you probably know what it is. Plasti Dip is easy to apply and even easier to remove if you don't like it. Doesn't wear off fast at all. I did several light coats to my motorcycle and it came out great. Minimum prep and great results.Tips: 1. Tape off only large areas, as you can peel off the smaller details. 2. Do only light coats. It may look like it's not getting on thick enough, but after a few coats it'll start looking good. Doing light coats avoids drips. 3. Don't worry about over spray. You can rub it off or use a little Goo Gone to get rid of mist over spray. 4. Between coats, turn the can upside down and spray (not on anything) for about two seconds to clear the spray cap. I made the mistake of sitting it down and coming back to a clogged cap which I then had to let sit in acetone to clear.I used four can on my motorcycle and that was because it wanted it really thick. I think two cans would have cut it for the tank, front fender and rear fender.

Easy to replace, took around an hour, only requires removal of about 6 screws along the header channel. everything else is either snaps or velcro.First week:Definitely quieter than standard denim top. I can hear my radio at highway speeds, and (don't tell my fiance) but can carry on conversations, too!Only fault i have with the top is that it is a bit looser than my previous bestop replacement top (my jeep is a 2000 so this is the second replacement).As seen in the pics, there is a pool of water forming over the front seats after only a 20 minute rain shower.(this never happened with the old bestop which was significantly tighter.While there was no apparent leaking, I do worry that it will prematurely wear the top.Other than that, I am quite pleased.

I just purchased a 2017 Chevrolet Silverado crew cab and was debating which window visors I wanted to install on it. I read reviews of two other brands that I usually purchase from, but was not happy with the reviews I was reading from amazon. People were saying that pieces either did not fit securely due to using clips to stay in the window channel or the item would bend once the window was rolled all the way up. I noticed people were recommending EGR in those reviews so I decided to check them out. The reviews were much more positive. I also noticed that EGR is one of the brands that Chevrolet uses when they put window visors on at the dealership. I decided to go with these and am pretty satisfied. Install was easy and took less than 30 minutes. It could probably take less time but I lean on the cautious side. I cleaned inside the channels with a damp cloth and held the rear visors in place for 30 seconds each once installed to make sure they stuck well. The result was pleasing, I've attached before and after photos to show how they came out.

I was initially hesitant buying these after reading about so many people having trouble installing theirs, but went ahead and ordered anyway.After watching a YouTube video for some hints, I had both installed in about twenty minutes.  Very sturdy, and they look great.Make sure that the larger part of the holes are facing into the Jeep, so that the bolts end up sitting flush with the bars.  Also, either stuff a rag under the bolt in the A-pillar, or use some other method to ensure you don't drop the bolt into the pillar.  If you do, prepare for a long afternoon.  I used a piece of cardboard (part of an empty toilet paper roll), held under the bolt as I was unscrewing, so it fell out and not down.Put the bolts in on their own first, just to get an idea of the angle that they seat in at.  Once you see that, it's a piece of cake.Would love it if other colour options were available for the grips.

The design intent from the OEM is to be able to just push/snap the wiper into place but the tabs on these connectors don't have a leading chamfer on them. So you have to squeeze the tabs in turn breaking them off (see photo). I used the connectors from a competitors wiper blade to install them.On a positive note, the winter wiper blades are excellent. Being able to purchase them on Amazon is good because local auto part stores don't carry them.

I was referred to this from a video by IDParts on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpaSw9NGwds.  I purchased this with a Noco GCP1 (also from Amazon).

It attaches extremely quickly to my SunJoe SPX3000, and with the quick release it comes off just as easily. I was worried that it wouldn't work as well as some of the more expensive 'brand' name models; those worries quickly faded away as I saw all the foam spraying out. This thing works amazing and the price is even better. Very heavy duty and durable. Make sure you use the adjustments to get the right mixture of air/water/shampoo for perfect foam action! I test it out on my boss's Mercedes CLS 63 and a cheapo pressure washer they have(under $100) and the results speak for themselves!

Light bar is ok, you must silicone it to prevent it from fogging up. otherwise you get fog streaks. You get what you pay for. be careful with the screws when removing the lens, they can stripe out. its waterproof but not fog proof. the wire harness is a good, but the switch is a little sticky, works sometimes and other times you have to click it a few times for it to go on. I don't know if i did something wrong but the led light on the switch is always on so i disconnect the quick connector when i park my Jeep so i don't drain my battery. I'm to lazy to figure out whats wrong. probably needs a tail off of the relay to a aux terminal. I work on vehicles all day but not bothered to figure it out. It looks awesome otherwise. Honestly u can't go wrong if u get this, its cheap but works. just have to prep it with silicone before mounting it. Haven't done anything with the pods yet. I would buy again.

I really like the way that these lights look in my 5th wheel.  They give a very nice, clean warm white light.  If you are looking to replace your regular incandescent bulbs, I highly recommend giving these LED replacements a shot.  I liked the first batch that I ordered so much after the first trip out with them, I ordered more to replace the remaining lights in my 5th wheel.

They seem to be durable and nice and thick rubber. I hope they last a good while. They fit in place like a glove and add that extra tough look to the interior of the jeep.

Used this for my chevy with a 700R4 transmission / Holley carb and it works great. Bolts on easily and is very sturdy. Instructions say it will also work with 200R4 transmission as well. It is more expensive than it should be, but it is a good product. I would also recommend using the Holley throttle bracket (PN 20-95) to make sure the geometry is correct as well. Holley Carbs using the throttle lever in the picture will work with this product.

No good brought 4 last year and towed a load at 40% of their rated capacity and so far 3 have come apart on the freeway costing me a fortune in emergency call outs. Seams like they don't like hot pavement. I'm going to replace the last one this week before it blows and takes out another rim.Yes I checked the tire pressure before I left and also checked the tires every time I stopped. The first 2 delaminated with a empty trailer with less than 200 miles on them. The third one went all the way to 300 miles. Please see picturers Stay clear these Chink chonk junk  tires will kill someone

Just installed and they actually work right. Only thing I need to do is get resistors to cancel out the hyper flashing. I recommend these to anyone looking for this style of blinker. My lens on my truck is dirty and needs cleaned in the picture.

I got this for my 14 Street glide and it fit perfect. I wanted to review this and add some pics as I didn't see any other the ones Kuryakyn has posted. It is thick plastic with 3m sticky tape on it. It comes with an alcohol pad to make sure all wax or polish if off of the chrome before applying this. Simple peel and stick and your done. It fills in that unsightly hole over the turn signal bar and gives the rear a smoother look. Will do the curved licence plate bracket next to go along with this piece. I haven't liked that hole since the day I got the bike and its a pain to keep that area clean in there...now its filled. I don't have many Kuryakyn parts on this bike, I usually stay strictly HD but the parts I do have, have served me well in the past. I hope this review helps.If you have any questions please feel free to leave it in the comments and I help you the best that I can. Util the next review Be Safe and keep your knees in the breeze.

We love these. They look phenomenal on the back of our JKU (which we call "Chula").Check out the pic I've attached.The only drawback to these is the fact that the reverse lights aren't bright enough. They need more lumens.

I was hesitant purchasing these with no reviews but I took a chance and am glad I did.  I liked this look for my 93 Toyota pickup more than the alternatives.  Like many of these kinds of lights you have to clean out the 4 screw holes (dried glue from assembly) to give yourself some room for play during installation.  These lights fit exactly as my stock lights had and plugged directly into the truck harness.  I had to slightly bend one of the brackets on the truck for a nice flush fit.  It only took a pair of pliers and a couple of minutes.  I was surprised to see this shipped with bulbs, although I still changed them out and went with LEDs.  The lights are much brighter, mainly because the stock Toyota lights were quite opaque.  I liked the smoked look without blacking out the entire fixture.  The lens is actually clear, it is just the backdrop that is black.  The illuminated bulb in the photo is the brake/turn signal LED.  The LEDs I got and am happy with are http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HJEGQQ2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and the 1156 equivalent.

This is a nice looking case ... as long as you don't look too closely. The copy we got does not close all the way, leaving a gap large enough that you can see through it at the point where the key ring goes through the fob (see pic). We tried applying pressure with our hands, a book, have objects, even a clamp. No dice. My advice is to keep looking to find a better case.

Tools does work but is much larger than a more expensive kit from the tool truck but the difference is clear. Very difficult to move arms and doesn't work nearly as well as brand name kits I have used. Today I had a 2.7 Chrysler product and the arms wouldnt even fit into the balancer slots. Had to use my buddies Matco Kit which has been a nice tool to work with just 4 times the price but when you use it at least 1-2 two times in a day or several times in a week it is definitely the obvious choice! Good for a DIY'er looking to change crank seal on GM 3.1, 3.4, 3.5, 3.8 and 3.9. But failed me today an a 08 2.7 liter Charger :(

After 250k on my 01 Cummins, the front end was pretty worn out. Replaced both outer tie rod ends,  steering gearbox to try and fix the good o'l death wobble, no avail. Turned out my track-bar was totally shot. Repalced that and death wobble was cured! I had ordered this unit prior to getting the new track-bar installed, so by the time it got here my front end was already high and tight. After installing this unit, even with new track-bar, tie rods, steering gearbox, it helped tighten up the steering a noticable amount. I imagine if one was to install this with a worn out front end, the difference would be even more noticable. My truck has never drove so nice! Buyer beware though, this same CNS  unit can be had had ebay for $60 with free shipping!

The other intake systems are open at the filter and could allow water intrusion much easier.

Bought two of these I have a wrx wagon with a td04 and a fxt with a vf39 fits the td04 great not a good fit on the vf39 said sti in the description so figured it would work on the vf39 but eh seems to rub on the wastegate arm and won't cover the pass side of the turbo very well. Soaked them in water Put the springs on the small end of the blanket sinched down the hooks and attached a piece of wire to the front spring to fish it under the turbo. So if you have a car with a td04 buy this cant beat it for the price. If you have a sti or vf swapped car keep looking.

Latch it a little flimsy but all in all great for what I was doing I put these on my 07 streetglide with no major modifications. I had to adjust the mounts and exhaust which is normal for aftermarket bags. I did take the spacers out of mounts to close gap a little. Ill update pics with fender overlay after everything is painted and exhaust is cut out. Pls click helpful if it was because no one ever goes into detail about custom stuff on here.

VERY BAD KEY FOB! First of all the description says [uncut needs be brought to a locksmith to be cut], but there is nothing to cut because there is NO BLANK KEY!!! Second, transferring the "guts" of your genuine fob will need a mod on the new housing; the remote pcb plate is positioned with the help of two plastic pins. The distance of the plastic pins is not precise and you will have to cut off one of the pins in order to accommodate the plate. Third: The logo is already glued on the fob, however the screw holding the housing together is under that plate; basically you will have to scratch/destroy it. Also the logo is placed in a very ugly manner on the fob.All in all, I made it work, but compared to my previous fobs this is the WORST!I do not recommend this product, seller and brand.The photo shows how the logo is placed by the manufacturer

Purchased this O2 sensor for my 2004 Toyota Camry LE 4 cylinder that had a check engine light illuminated and a PO136 bank 1 sensor 2 error code.  This is the O2 sensor that is downstream from the catalytic converter (not the sensor that is on the exhaust manifold pipe accessible via the engine compartment).  Removing the failed sensor required getting my Camry on ramps so I could comfortably crawl under the car to use a 24" breaker bar wrench extender to spin out the old sensor.  I could not budge the old sensor with a wrench and penetrating oil alone. This O2 sensor has electrical wires and rubber grommet that allow the connector to travel through the floor of the car to make the electric connection inside the car (often under one of the front seats.) My model Camry has the electrical connection on the underside of the car.  I coiled the extra wire and secured it to the underside of my car with zip ties.  This sensor also comes with a small container of goop which you can apply to the threads of the sensor to make it easier to remove in the future. Do not get any of the goop on the sensor probe.  After driving about 15 miles, the check engine light disappeared.

All I can say is WOW!!!! I have a Minivan which carries 4 children ages 3-12 years old.  I have soda, pee, poop, vomit and melted chocolate stains.  Bought carpet cleaners from local stores and was unable to remove the stains.  Thought I may have to spend hundreds at a detail shop.  Guess not, bought a small bottle to try out and wished I bought the bigger bottle.  The instructions say to mix with water.  Well I didn't cause I want to make sure the stains are gone for good.  Spray on wait for a few minutes and used the brush attachment for my drill and scrubbed away.  Every stubborn stain was gone.  Now the carpet looks like new.  Going to get a bigger bottle since I have 2 other cars to clean.

This thing has a lot of space! Plenty of room for all of my off road gear with enough space to store and lock up anything valuable I'd have inside my Jeep. This is my second storage vault. The original shipment was damaged and had to be returned. This one has a couple chips in the paint, but that's fine by me. It's gonna get used and bruised.My complaint with the vault is getting it secured to the Jeep. The supplied L brackets are great in the rear, but the self tapping screws don't bite into anything on the bottom. If you hit a bump at speed the front end of the box lifts up and slams back down. Also, my drawer was rubbing against the housing making an unbearable chirping sound while driving. Couldn't take that anymore and picked up some weather stripping to separate the metal. No more chirping, but the drawer doesn't close all the way now. I'll work on that some more, but I'm happy that noise is gone!Included pix of damage to original order

Wow, I am REALLY impressed by this OTC press, it is absolutely MASSIVE. No one else in the shop has one so I had no idea of its size. It is MUCH bigger than I expected. You are NOT going to bend it, I guarantee it. And the screw is huge also, it is about 1-1/8" in diameter. You will never damage the threads. I am so glad I got this made in USA OTC press instead of the cheap Chinese units. If you want quality, buy this one.

this type is the type u wanna get. i am an led nerd. i upgrade when i find something better. these r the best.  they are brighter than the regular 25 watt bulb. they all light up and they all become bright for the second filament. if ur doing tail lights get the red. red light behind red lense looks the best.... no orange tint cause by using white light underneath red lense.  tho u want white light under orange lenses.  orange under orange looks ugh.  white under orange gives u light orange.... orange under orange give u a darker less appealing orange.

When ordering this product please take in consideration most companies rebrand, rebadge, and relabel other companies products as their own. They do this when both companies make a contract agreement to do so. They contract the production of products to other companies to meet demand and save overhead costs. All auto parts stores do the very same. So ignore the the reviews complaining about this not being an Exedy product. Exedy rebranded a Equal Under Pressure product that's distributed by Daikin Clutch. That Exedy then distributes to companies like Amazon. I took a photo to show this is and actual "Exedy" branded product. As for the product itself it's fantastic. I bought this Master cylinder to for my 1984 Nissan 300ZX. and it fits perfectly. Another thing that need to be taken in consideration is this product may fit more than just the 1984-1989 Nissan 300zx. Most automakers design cars to use preexisting parts. That saves resources that would've exhausted to research and develop another solution. With that being said this master cylinder may have multiple applications. Hope this helps you on your decision.

The Strain plot is exactly what I wanted I've been wondering if this has existed for many years and I finally came across it. I love that all I have to do is Twist lever in the oil just comes out I don't have to get oil all over my hands or all over the ground I took a PVC tube and attached it to it when I needed to drain my oil and stuck the other end of the PVC tube into my oil drain pan and twisted the ball joint rubber and voila Instant Oil Change. It was designed specifically  my vehicle so I knew it was going to fit. It is made from high quality brass and stainless steel parts and so far I have had no leaks oil around it or coming out of it. This is probably hands down the single most important piece of equipment I've ever purchased for my vehicle and I love it I cannot wait to use it I might actually do oil changes more often now. It came packaged nicely in a bag the same as if you were to see it hanging on a shelf in AutoZone and all in all I love this thing

I bought this cover for my 2005 Nissan Frontier.  I needed to be able to stow stuff safely in the bed since my wife and I just had our second kid and there was no more room in the cab for all the stuff that comes when you have to haul around two kids!  Just wanted to note that I purchased this cover by MaxMate because it looked exactly like the same one listed on Amazon by Tyger but it was thirty dollars cheaper.  When the package showed up it was the Tyger cover.  It had all the paper work from Tyger and the Tyger logo stitched into the back of the cover.  As previous reviewers have noted the installation instructions for this cover suck.  I read all the reviews before I purchased this cover so I was expecting that.  It still took me two hours to install even though I knew what to expect. The hardest part of installation was getting the clamps lined up properly.  I have the utilitrack system in my bed so I did have to loosen the rear tracks to get the provided adapters to slide in.  The front ones were tight but did slide in without having to loosen the utilitrack.  The other frustrating thing was the front clamps. There are three possible positions for them to be in.  Once I had the other hardware in for the utilitrack I had to adjust the clamps from their innermost position to where one went to the outermost position and the other went to the middle position.  It sounds a bit confusing to read but once you see the clamps you'll see what I'm talking about.  Also before you get everything lined up and ready to clamp down make sure you put on the weather stripping to the front of the bed.  I forgot to do this at first and had everything lined up then had to move it all to install the weather strip!  So once everything was all lined up I clamped it down and it looks great!  It is tightly sealed to the bed and I think it should be weatherproof. You just have to make sure you lock your tailgate to prevent anyone from lifting the cover or getting into the bed while you're away from your truck.  I haven't had a chance to drive with it yet so I'm hoping to get improved gas mileage as other reviewers have claimed.  I'll try and update my review once I can drive around for awhile and see how things go.  So far I'm really happy with the way it looks and the functionality it will provide for my lifestyle.

Great bags, well made and they give plenty if storage even without using the while set. I have 2 pieces I didn't use simply because I had no use for that much storage. I love the fact that you can unclip the bags from the center so you don't have to take the whole set off just one side or both if you need.

It works for my custom supercharged sport trac... but it looks like its home made. Cuts were jagged and there even looked like it had permanent marker lines where to cut on the upper portion.

Great item lowered the back of my 2015 silverado like it said it would. I did have to cut a seam for clearance to remove old shackle and install the new one. Cuttin this seam is much easier than removing the bed. I like how the truck looks now . Highly recommend this product if you are looking for lowering shackles. Came intact and haven't had any issues. I don't know if you can tell buy the pictures but u can definately tell when seen in person. Ride quality was not affected either.

The more I use this product the more I like it. I have developed some opinions surrounding this product & topic and here they are, again only my opinion based on my research and limited experience.1. The FatMat is slightly more difficult to install (correctly) than the Dynamat Extreme. (the only other similar product I've used)2. This FatMat product is 80mil and $2.20 a sq ft, Dynamat E is .67mil and costs $4.16 a sq ft (on date of review)3. FatMat will conform and stick to about any shape but it may take more elbow grease and possibly heat. In some areas I did use a hair dryer.4. If you take your time installing and use both ends of your roller, (the wooden handle end is very useful in the tight recessed and indented areas) you will get excellent results.5. Surface contact is key and surface contact is key, did I mention the importance of surface contact?6. The foil seems thicker on the FM. Just going by feel here, not very scientific.7. Based on the product weight (not shipping weight) currently listed on Amazon, the FatMat weighs in at .46# per sq ft vs the Dynamat E at .36# per sq ft. This could be good or bad depending on your view.8. Personally i think the extra mass of the FatMat is a bonus. Another product used for sound deadening is actually called Mass Loaded Vinyl or MLV. Its probably right above your feet on your vehicles firewall already. I know the theory is for the dampener (fatmat) to reduce vibration and the MLV with a decoupler (commonly foam) to stop airborne sound. Ive also heard people say you don't need much coverage with the dampener and while that may be truth for stopping vibrations when installed with 100% coverage I think it does more than that. Personally I went with about 75% coverage on the inside of the doors (outer skin) and 100% coverage just under the door panel. I then spray glued felt on the backside of my thin door panels before reattaching them. On the entire floor and wheel wells I went one layer 100% coverage followed by continuous layer of luxury liner pro befor carpet. In the rear cargo area I also added 1/8" thick MLV on top of the factory carpet pad but under the carpet.9. Lastly I need to mention I was impressed by FatMats customer service. After ordering I emailed to see if there was anyway I could ensure shipment earlier. I received a response very quickly letting me know they would ship immediately and I would have it when i needed it. Very responsive. I emailed back thanking them and they emailed me back with a "you're welcome". Its the small things.

Incredibly loud, although not as low pitched as I had hoped. The trumpets unscrew from the diaphragms and I removed the 12v solenoid. I plumbed them through a manual momentary push button valve and used them as part of a parade float! My only complaint is the mount is inadequate for the weight of these horns. I used a stainless machine screw and actually drilled a hole in the bell of the longest horn to stop it from bouncing. It might be ok out of the wind of attached to the solid frame of a vehicle but I would still be worried that it could snap. I had an 11 gallon air tank filled to 100 psi and no on board compressor. I got plenty of use out of these horns on parade day and still had about 80psi in the tank when I parked it. It was a hoot! (Pun intended)

This is easily the best designed trunk organizer I've found in some 45 years of driving.  Sturdy, able to keep its shape when in use, yet easily folded flat when you need it out of the way, and even designed so that it doesn't slide around in the trunk when you go around a corner (Velcro strips on the bottom, that adheres to the carpeting)-- this is the third product I've owned from JACO, and the quality is consistent.The organizer is made of heavy grade 600D Oxford Polyester fabric (although I admit I don't know what the "Oxford" in the description means, and doubt that it attended a British university), and when unfolded has two large, square compartments, each a bit more that a cubicle foot in size (they're actually14 inches deep), with two interior, net-type pockets per compartment, along with two more exterior pockets, at either end.  The fold-down "floor" of each of the main compartments is a hard plastic panel, easily cleaned.  They're strong enough to support a good deal of weight, as are the carrying handles, which have cushioned grips.I won't get to enjoy it.  My daughter, who has the (inherited) habit of naming her vehicles, has just gotten a new family van. The organizer will be a Christmas present-- not for my daughter, but for her vehicle, by name, from Santa Cars.  Every good vehicle should get one.Recommended.[Sample product for evaluation impartial review.]

We have about 6 of them floating around our company. They don't appear super strong, but we have yet to have one break. They are not the loudest, but get the point across. We have a fleet of about 20 trucks and some plants require beepers. We don't visit them much, but when we do, we send a beeper. Much better then listening to it all the time, and going threw the trouble on personal vehicles. It's easier

Wheels on my BMW X5 have double spokes. Cleaning in between and behind the spokes was a pain. This brush easily gets in betwen the spokes.One disadvantage - the handle is made of wood and it gets slippery when using the brush. I think there are better materials for the handle to ensure good grip.

This thing is exactly what I needed.  Very well built.  Others complained of some play in the guide, but I just don't see it.  Worked flawlessly for me.  This tool made tapping an absolute breeze.  If you have anything to tap that can be put on your drill press or mill table, then this tool is HIGHLY recommended!  (I bought two sizes of this wrench and both were excellent.)

I am giving this product a one star review not only because of the flawed product, but because of customer support that included lying, for which I have no tolerance.The black transmitter with all white lettering is a different image than it was when I purchased this product. Instead of only white lettering mine had colors. There was no backlight, no glow in the dark feature. I have seen newer versions for sale from other retailers that now have backlit transmitters. My understanding is that like mine, they do not have a replaceable battery so I assume they are meant to have to be repurchased.Installation wen fine aside from there being two white wires without clear instructions regarding which went to what. I soldered all of my connections and did a professional install. The steering wheel of my Ford Excursion was not thick enough to hold the transmitter secure so I stuffed some folded heavy paper between it and the wheel, which sufficed and was not visible.The malfunction is in the transmitter. I never know what will happen when I press a button. The Joying stereo almost always responds immediately, but the transmitter sends signals as if they were from different buttons. For example, pressing the volume up key could result in starting the navigation or phone app. The same with all of the other keys, never knowing what signal they might transmit.Tiker customer service was friendly and quick to respond. They said they would send me a free replacement right away. A couple months went by without a package from them so I checked on the status. I was told that it was held up in China. Some time later they tell me they are shipping a new one. It arrived within weeks of that update.The new one has only 5 keys. I took pictures of the old and new side by side and sent them to customer service asking if the large button labeled as a single key would still function as a two key button. I was told yes, it is still the same even though all of the lettering on the new one was white and only 5 keys were labeled instead of 7.I was told I had to replace both the transmitter and the receiver for the new transmitter to work. This was untrue. I spent the hours cutting my perfectly soldered connections and soldering the new receiver in its place. All of this to discover that the new transmitter they sent did not work at all. I assume the battery was dead but could not figure out how to disassemble the transmitter to even look at the battery.I tried using the old transmitter and discovered both receivers will respond to the old transmitter, so all of the wiring work I had just done was unnecessary. I then also discovered that the new receiver would no longer recognize all 7 keys of the old transmitter. The new receiver was incapable of working with a 7 keyed transmitter.Ended up having to reinstall my old system, which is still malfunctioning, but better than the non-functioning replacement they sent me. If Tiker is able to send me a fully functional replacement that matches my original purchase I will adjust my star rating. I expect I will have to purchase a new system from another vendor since Amazon is showing the white labeled 7 key model pictured in the ad as unavailable.Update as of three days after posting this review, they have been quick to respond. They have refunded me $6. The original price I believe was around $37.

So far so good.  Went on great.  Make sure you heat up cans in warm water (90-100 degree) range so droplets are perfect for good coverage.  Matched up perfect with the OEM headlight black trim. Will update in a year or so (or earlier if product fails). I used pre-dip spray and cleaned well prior.  Also will be using dipcoat to keep it in good condition.

Installed this kit on my 2011 Crown Victoria police interceptor.  Didn't use the horn parts because I rewired my horn to a horn button on the dash.  I highly recommend getting the Grant 4000 2"  extension kit as well.  Now I can sit back farther from the dash and my legs and knees are away from hitting dash.  All works great with the Grant steering wheel.

6/19/18As other reviews said, they seem very sturdy and well built. There are small holes drilled out in some areas that are hidden to the eye. Not sure what these are for and could cause rusting issues in the future, not sure. Would give it 5 stars but false advertising really. Online says "provides maximum wheel-to-wheel protection for underside and rocker panel area from damaging impacts, keeps Jeep from catching on rocker panel and hanging up on obstacles." which it would but the way the crossbars that bolt to the frame are welded to the sliders, they are not flush and are underneath which may cause a place for snagging on rocks/roots/etc. Also, when you get it, in the instructions it says "will not protect vehicle and are only meant for cosmetic purposes". Take a close look at the pictures in the description and you will know what I mean. Only time will tell how sturdy or good these are.

The overall fit and finish of this intake over any other make is far superior. No more thin metal tube and bent metal other companies like to call a housing. This CAI fits perfect and installs quickly. Directions are great with good color images describing what to do specifically for my Tundra. Im not saying anything about performance but mpgs have improved. Ive never seen 15mpg on my Tundra and now I do. Its always averaged 13.5mpg because of my daily driving is local only up and down a big mountain road. Truck certainly sounds better. I highly recommend S&B products to anyone looking.

First one returned because the stitching was coming apart. Second one from my local store and there is no way a Maglight is fitting in there. Yes the velcro for the roll bar is way too long, but that's easy to cut to size. It's the strap that goes over the top of the light to hold it in is about 4in too short.

These license plate frames are awesome. They only require 2 screws are make the car look clean and more attractive. I have these on my black car and they blend in and don't stand out at all. The reason why I did not give 5 stars was because I had to order another frame for my back due to the fact that some rust started to form after the winter, I'm not sure if this was a defect but the new plate has been holding up great! I would recommend it to everyoneUpdate:I've had the plates for around 8 months and started to notice rust forming I don't know if I got a bad plate but I had to buy a new one.

I pulled an 18 feet trailer with 2 quads and camping gear as well as the jeep loaded to the max; I can tell you these bags are well worth to buy, not only when towing but also on daily use, I do run them to min air 5psi when not loaded or towing and ride fantastic, maximum air when loaded 30psi and the ride was nice and comfortable no sagging or jumping just about right! Highly recommended.

Ive only had these tires on my truck for a week, but Ive put over 300 miles on them so far. Off road traction is good, and snow is no issue for them. On road, they're very quiet and soft, I definitely notice a major improvement in the ride when going down crappy roads. I have a feeling Im gonna like these tires a lot

This is a very good product but I am stopping short of giving it five stars because of a few shortcomings, none of which, however, are dealbreakers.  This is an excellent value Tonneau top for the price and it gets the job done, deterring casual theft (once the tailgate is locked, the contents are mostly secure but the cover material wouldn't stop anyone with a sharp knife from slashing and grabbing) and protecting the bed and contents from the weather.  Installation was easy and took less than 10 minutes for me, and I assume that removal and reinstallation in the future will be even easier.  Once fully installed, the top is not completely flat and you can see the support ribs below showing through the top (see attached pictures), but it is not unsightly and I don't even notice it anymore.  The corners do not make 100% contact around the bed but I have been through half a dozen automatic car washes already and there is only very minor leakage into the bed (I would estimate only 2 - 3 ounces of water got through and I assume it is from those corners--see attached picture with red circle indicating a corner where light is shining through).  I did drive through the rain on the highway, and experienced a few monsoon thunderstorms in Phoenix with it on and I couldn't find any evidence of water leakage so I assume its the higher pressure car wash and dryer that forced the water into the bed.  I would recommend this product for protecting your gear from the elements and casual theft; if you need serious security, look elsewhere, but for hauling camping gear, groceries, and junk, it's more than adequate.

This organizer is everything I was looking for. It's sturdy, high sided, well made and a thoughtful design. I use it in my truck bed (pic attached) to keep my emergency kit and other items handy. I'm also w/ the USCG Auxiliary, and this will be useful moving materials in and out of the truck. I've had several organizers over the years - and this one easily competes with ones that cost twice as much. The Company founder personally followed up after purchase - these folks make a great product AND stand behind it. Look at the competition and you'll be hard pressed to find a better organizer. The fact is has reflective tape and can be used at night in an emergency is a really great feature.UPDATE: 6 months of heavy use and I yanked the side seam loose. Emailed the company and the very same day they responded that they are sending me another on free of charge. THAT IS A COMPANY who STANDS behind their product.

This vinyl sheet is incredible and I just love it. A picture is worth thousand words and I encourage the reader to check out some of the pictures of the panniers I used the sheet on my 2015 Yamaha FJ-09 motorcycle. I like the way it has turned out, but of course beauty is the eyes of the beholder. I have no idea how long will it last or if it will fade with time. I however love it at this moment. My prediction is that it will be fine even outdoors for a while. The material is of excellent quality, build, and finish. Some of the pictures have a white fluorescent decal that I believe is also from the same company. I strongly recommend it if you wish to add some accent to your vehicle or other indoor/outdoor items. By the way, the red is not that bright red and I was initially worried about blending with the skin tone of my motorcycle, but at the end it looks nice. It is also not that glossy - somewhere in between glossy and matt, but I like it that way.

This is a pretty high quality cover. It would have been nice to know you have to undo the straps before your first time putting it on.My camper is 19'-1". I bought the size for trailers up to 20'. It fit good. A little too much material in the front but that is probably because my trailer is sloping in the front instead just a flat front. Fit over the roof air conditioner and tv antenna just fine. The straps really pull it tight around the front, back, and underneath the trailer.Overall, great product. I hope it holds up to the Florida sun and summer thunderstorms.

Wanted a good solid tie down for the batteries in my boat, and these did the trick.Keep in mind these do not have a ratchet system.  You pull the strap then the buckle uses a leverage synch and lock.PROs:  Everything, Strong, solid, Metal mount brackets.CONs:  1 set was missing one of the mounting brackets, making it unusable.(That is the reason for 4 starts)

Ordered another 2-pack and did not need four so ordered this one.While cleaning up plates and installing the 2-pack of Zone Tech Clear License Plate Shields - 2-Pack Novelty/License Plate Clear Bubble Shields, this single plate when taken out of the wrapper felt like hard plastic with little give.Removed the plate, cleaned the frame and installed.  While tightening the second bolt as it was pulling everything 'together' it cracked around the nut and frame and there was not that much pressure.If you want a better deal, don't order unless it does not require tightening, and I was using the proper screwdriver, the other two went on fine, this one cracked and not only out the money but have to buy another.  Like throwing money away...

UPDATE: After a month and a few hundred winter (Dark) miles I have to say that I am impressed with the light and the value.  They make people think this is a much newer bike and I can SEE.  Great gobs of wide bright light.  The are not Spot lifghts, they are more of a fog pattern with a wide beam that lights around corners and curb to curb.  Plus, people see me coming at night.These are imitations of the lights on the 2014 and later Harley big twin motorcycles.  They are very good imitations with similar performance at 1/10th the price!  I have ridden a 2014 Ultra Limited and liked the lights a lot.  I did not like the $800 figure I found when out looking for similar lighting from Harley for my 2000 Ultra Classic.  So, Amazon to the rescue.  These lights took about 30 minutes to install.  They are physically deeper that the Halogen.  One went right in and the other needed some pressure while tightening the ring.  Both included a new style automotive sealed connector pigtail to splice into the light bar wiring.  It went easy.  These pull little power but put out tremendous light.  I also installed the matching headlight&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/7-34-LED-Headlight-LITEWAY-80W-For-Harley-Davidson-Motorcycle-Chrome-PROJECTOR-DAYMAKER-HID-LED-Light-Bulb-Jeep-Wrangler-LED-Headlamp-With-Ring-Mounting-Bracket-All-Harley-Model-Wire-Harness-Adapter/dp/B01KWVS7J2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">7" LED Headlight LITEWAY 80W For Harley Davidson Motorcycle Chrome PROJECTOR DAYMAKER HID LED Light Bulb Jeep Wrangler LED Headlamp With Ring Mounting Bracket , All Harley Model Wire Harness Adapter</a>.  The entire process to install these lights and the headlight took less than an hour including taking pictures, video and rolling the bike outside to aim the headlight.Pro's: - Price cannot be beat - Shipping via Prime was fast - The lights look great on the bike - Bright white light in a wide, flat pattern great for lighting the side of the road out about 100'Con's - One of my housings was tight getting this in there.  They are right on the edge of being too big - They do not say "Harley Davidson" (which is what the extra $265 must be paying for if you buy at the dealer) - No guarantee like I would get at a dealer

Best I can tell this is a 3M product manufactured in China. (I would not use without lubricant). I used "Gary Dean's Detail Juice" not cheap but a bottle goes a long way,which makes it a good deal, for claying use 2.5 oz. to 1 gal. of distilled water, or mix to your liking. I break  the clay bar into about a 1/3 or less that way you can compress it between the palms of your hands flat. I let the bar slide on the Detail Juice, I do not apply a lot of pressure, just let it slide if it sticks or drags, apply more Detail Juice.When the paint is free of contaminates and collected in the clay bar it will slide like its on ice. When you see the bar is getting dirty just fold it into itself and keep going.If you drop the clay on the ground throw it away Do Not try to wash it off as you may end up putting scratches in your paint. Just get a new piece of clay.I have added pictures of my 2001 Honda & 2005 Silverado both cars are parked outside all the time both cars have over 100k in miles and had never been polished prior to the following process. Products used were bought on Amazon: I use a wash with no wax in it then, 3M China clay, Gary Dean's Detail Juice I use a DA polisher with Meguiar's  M100,, with Chemical Guys Hex orange foam pad, then M205, with Hex white foam pad followed by Meguiars Synthetic sealant with a white foam pad.For follow up wash and wax I use Gel-Gloss wash & wax followed up with "In My opinion" The easiest wax to use & no worries about over spray, "Protect All" with Carnauba, spray on use an quality microfiber application mitt to make sure everything is covered let dry and wipe off with a plush border less microfiber towel. If you can't find these towels on amazon, search the rag shop. For plastics, vinyl and tires I use 303 Aerospace Protectant. None of these processes are hard, just take your time and you will be extremely pleased. It took me several days to complete each car or truck, I was working in the driveway and would have to use early morning or late afternoon shade.I have also used these clay bars to remove a 14 inch strip of white paint off of a black car. The remaining scratch was removed with Meguiar's products listed above fortunately there was no dent.  Gotta love people in parking lots that hit & run!

The crud that came out of that truck, wow.  Unfortunately I cannot tell you if it was because of this because I can't go back in time and flush it without it, but it was nice to know that it may have helped and it wasn't that expensive.  I threw it in a few days before with mostly water and it looks like it could have helped.  I would recommend it to a friend.

Overall this is a good kit. I confess that when I first found this, I went over to my local hardware store just to see about buying all the parts to do this myself.  I quickly realized that there were two problems to this approach.  First, the metal that I could locally was either too big to do any good in protecting the radiator from larger debris or too small to allow a reasonable amount of air to pass through.  Second, the parts and pieces I did find quickly put me up around $30-33 for all the pieces and that still left me having to spend time using primer and spray gloss on the metal mesh that I had found.  For a few bucks more you can get this kit and all the work is done for you.  So overall, this is a good value and avoids a lot of time trying to fabricate something that probably would not end up looking as good.I only knock off 1 star because I think glue should be included.  It took me a while to track down a suitable plastic adhesive that could handle heat and moisture but still remain flexible. I was not confident in using just the adhesive foam mounts as I've had those come loose on me in other applications. I'd prefer they just include a tiny tube of the appropriate adhesive inside the kit which would have saved me the time.I included some install pictures.  One tip I found is that you should start with all the zip ties loose, only just barely engaged.  Then slowly tighten them working from one grill piece to the next. This really helps keep them lined up and evenly spaced across the whole grill. I tightened some of them too quickly and ended up removing some zip ties and redoing them because it pulled the next grill too far to one side.  My kit included some extra adhesive mounts, so I put those on the outside ends.  I also had extra zip ties which I added between grill pieces as extra insurance should something come loose.My only long term concern is the durability of the zip ties.  I know they are not going to last forever, but the good news is that they are behind the grill entirely so they are protected from the harshest of UV radiation which is the most likely thing to damage them.  Luckily the grill only takes a couple of minutes to remove. I was very surprised how easy it was.  So I really don't mind if sometime in the future it requires a little repair effort on my part.This is a great alternative to some of the insanely priced grill kits.  It would be a 5 star item if they just threw in that little tube of glue.

I bought these at a local O'Rileys Auto Parts Store for $46/each. Much better deal on Amazon, but I didn't want to wait a week for the free economy shipping; Amazon Prime is not offered. These rear shocks are not sold in pairs so you will need to buy two.Install is easy. The only thing that needs to be removed for access for the shock installation are the back wheels.  Shock is labeled which side is installed down, just in case you are not sure. This is literally a two bolt install. Very easy and if you want a step by step process, Youtube is your best bet. I locked them in with 85 ft. lb. torque on the wrench.Ride is noticeably smoother and quieter. My 2004 Jeep Liberty V6 3.7 L 4X4 runs over the road bump and potholes and just laughs at them. Very nice aftermarket shock.

I used these as open garage door indicators. Wired up with magnetic switches and small plug in transformers.  Used the no longer needed landline phone wires to display these indicator lights at various spots in two houses. No more going to bed with the garage doors open. Must carefully bend the contacts to get wires connected. One of the ten failed within a week but I ordered another ten pack anyway. SURPRISE The second batch of these lights are incandescents, not LED's like the first set. The new version glows at partial brightness when it is supposed to be "off".  The seemingly identical LED's on the same circuit continue to work totally off or totally on.  I do NOT see this detail in the description,. Rating reduced because of this sneaky fact.  I'll have to find a true LED lamp of the same size to correct this error

After a lot of research I decided to go with the ROLA 59502 2" Steel Cargo Carrier - 2 Piece hitch hauler.  I had borrowed another manufacturer's one from a neighborhood and was very disappointed that it wobbled and was very poor quality.  I wanted something heavy duty that would hold up for a long time.  The ROLA  unit here is very strong and does not lean or wobble.  It is constructed of heavy gauge steel and built for the long haul.I decided to add LED stop/turn/tail lights purchased on Amazon: (2 Autosmart Kl-35100rk Red Oval Sealed LED Turn Signal and Parking Light Kit with Light, Grommet and Plug for Truck,Trailer (Turn, Stop, and Tail Light)I paired them with the (Hopkins 48135 48" 4 Wire Flat Trailer Side Connector) to make my own kit saving me a few bucks over the prewired kit offered on Amazon.  I wanted to make sure all the connection would be secure so I soldered all my connections and heat shrink'd all the wires to make sure I had a strong weather proof connection.  I used a piece of 1/2 inch PVC pipe to get the wires from the back to the front on the bottom side of the hitch hauler, placing rubber grommets on the end where the wires come through to insure they do not wear over time.I decided to go with the  (ROLA 59119 Rainproof Cargo Carrier Bag 59" x 24" x 24" (20 Cu Ft) to place my luggage in.  This bag is huge and top quality.  The dimensions are accurate and fit the ROLA 59502 perfectly.I am very happy with the way my project turned out.  It was more expensive than other options but I think I have a much higher quality setup than any of the competitors on the market are offering.  Set-up and build was easy with the included instructions.  The only thing I did was buy some additional heavy duty washers for the curved bar connections in the middle (Chrome bar)  They give you 4 but I wanted a washer on both sides as the slot was only slightly smaller than the head of the bolt.Shipping was perfect box was intact.  I think there were a few holes in the box but this is a very heavy item so I can understand.  The ROLA sticker that is on the rear was coming loose after the first trip so I decided to remove it and replace it with a DOT high reflective Red/White sticker.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ROLA-59119-Rainproof-Cargo-Carrier-Bag-59-34-x-24-34-x-24-34-20-Cu-Ft/dp/B00MGTS1WW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ROLA 59119 Rainproof Cargo Carrier Bag 59" x 24" x 24" (20 Cu Ft)</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hopkins-48135-48-34-4-Wire-Flat-Trailer-Side-Connector/dp/B0049MIX68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hopkins 48135 48" 4 Wire Flat Trailer Side Connector</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/2-Autosmart-Kl-35100rk-Red-Oval-Sealed-LED-Turn-Signal-and-Parking-Light-Kit-with-Light-Grommet-and-Plug-for-Truck-Trailer-Turn-Stop-and-Tail-Light/dp/B00IKSRTBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">2 Autosmart Kl-35100rk Red Oval Sealed LED Turn Signal and Parking Light Kit with Light, Grommet and Plug for Truck,Trailer (Turn, Stop, and Tail Light)</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ROLA-59502-2-34-Steel-Cargo-Carrier-2-Piece/dp/B0016I8E1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ROLA 59502 2" Steel Cargo Carrier - 2 Piece</a>

Simple plug and play installation. I purchased these and the Xprite 60 watt CREE LED fog lights for an aftermarket bumper on my 2018 JLU with factory halogen fog lights. The bumper had JKU style fog light mounted with 4 mounting holes. The factory fog lights mount with only 3 attachment points

This thing fits real well and looks flush. I used it to install a Kenwood KDC-MP345-u and it slid right in and clicked into place nice and securely. This was a great buy and addition to my car. I had absolutely no issues with the installation and it looks great. The only problem I had with this was that it originally arrived with broken clips that I noticed before I even opened the package but I contacted Amazon about the issue and they immediately refilled an order for a replacement and provided me with a shipping label for me to send the broken one back free of charge. The replacement came in half the time it took for the original one to arrive and was in better, safer, packaging. Despite the problem I had with the first one, this was a great buy and I'm fully satisfied.

The product was easy to install but I received it with defects. The metal were smash up and deformed on both end of the bars where they attach to the truck. Before mounting the bar I had to reshape them. Also the LED light bar had condensation buildup within the first week.  Lund needs to improve the LED light bar that is included with this product .

Did absolutely nothing for my car. I even added more then suggested to see if that helped. Nope. I let it sit on the car for a while and still nothing. Nothing in this car was removed any dirt. The only dirt removed was from my pressure washer and just plain water. Total waste of money. See the pics of after the wash. The ligh gray is dirt after drying. This car has only been in the rain. No salt no snow. Don't waste your money !!

This charger adapter plate is perfect for those that want a hard mounted indicator and a easy way to charge the battery.  I used this on my Can Am X3 side by side and its perfect.  The little light indicator blinks when its charging or not which is an easy way to see what the battery status is.  I also have a voltmeter installed so its easy for me to see what my battery is at.

AWESOME product! Do NOT spend hundreds more on an sPOD when this item is available. Product arrived on time and well packaged. Instructions are adequate, but I suggest looking at some install videos on you-tube. Install took about an hour and a half and I couldn't be more pleased. Rocker switch covers are nice, almost everything you can think of. I would DEFINITELY purchase this again!

A more confident brake feel. Did front and back. Much bigger rotor than stock. Happy with results and jeep looks a lot tougher.additional note: whomever is complaining about squeaks it has to be because they didn't do the install right, that goes with any brake kits. use brake grease generously on the clips, pads anything that rubs outside of the rotor/brakepad ceramic.when you don't use grease in these rubbing points, thats what makes it squeak.

This is a complete kit - contained everything I needed to put 3 coats on my calipers. I could have applied a 4th but saw no need to do so. There is no need to remove the calipers - but removing them might make for a quicker (and easier) paint job. I recently replaced my rotors, discs, and brake lines and just didn't feel like taking them off again. Total time 4.5 hours including getting all four corners of my car up, cleaning the calipers, painting them, putting my wheels back on and lowering the car. I had more than enough of the cleaning solvent. I do recommend using Scotch Brite pads or equivalent to prepare the surface for better paint adhesion - as well as possibly providing a deeper cleaning - depending on the condition and existing finish on the calipers Great job G2!

It's alright the print is kinda sloppy looks pixilated not bad enough to disfigure it but enough to tell if you are close. I cut mine into pieces for it to fit my helmet. It is a nice sticker I don't think your be disappointed. There's creases on mine because of the curves on my helmet but if you're using it for a window on a car it should work fine.I'm gonna go head and say get it if you're a Dead Pool fan.

They light up the lower part of the road great, which I needed.Oh well, hope these last a long time.Easy to install, well packed, and arrived on time.See picture of my head lights with the slight tint of blue and then the fog lights.

This always fixes the little cracks and dings on my windshield. I've found that you want to keep an eye on them after 9-12 months. Had to refill one of mine that started cracking after a year. It's very easy to use and usually you won't use a full tube in one go.

Was beyond happy to receive this decal for my brand new car. Unfortunately, the decal was, what seems to me comparing to others, of low quality. The decal did not stick to the transfer paper at all and parts were coming off while other stuck. I was unable to even get the decal on my vehicle. I do not recommend this seller as the other decal (also from this seller) was having the same issue. I would assume I received a defunct print. However, with the issue being the same on two different decals, I will have to assume it is do the to quality of the paper. A refund request has been submitted for this decal.

These are VERY nice lights!  They are much brighter than the marketing photo, but still very soft light. You can stare right at them without any glare, and install is super easy. I was a little tentative before buying based on the photos, but put four of them in my little man cave trailer and they put out a very nice light.  Almost feels more like you are in a house than a cargo trailer.

Changed the oil in my front differential and used this gasket.  The gasket is flimsy but I did not have high expectations since it was so cheap and just hoped for the best.  I cleaned the mating surfaces thoroughly and torqued the cover bolts as recommended for my vehicle.  I filled it with oil and immediately noticed that was a very slow oil leak.  I re-torqued the differential bolts a little more hoping to stop the leak --- no success.  I do not recommend this gasket.  I ended up buying a better quality gasket and have no leak.  DON'T BE CHEAP AND SAVE YOURSELF A HEADACHE AND DO IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME -- buy a better quality gasket.

The EPAuto Portable Air Compressor is a compact and very useful tool to have. The unit has alligator clips which clip straight onto the cars battery for power. There is a powerful LED flashlight built in which is very useful. The compressor works great it has an easy to read display and there is an auto shut-off' feature at the desired pressure. The compressor is also useful for inflatables at the beach etc. I am very happy to have this piece of emergency equipment in my car and I know I will be using it for inflating tubes at the river and other inflatables. There is a nice carry bag included as well as all the adaptors needed.I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

This is a good roll of tint for small jobs. I used it to tint my side mirrors because of moron drivers in my area always driving with highs on and I needed something to subdue the brightness from those high beams. This tint is very dark blue, I can't see using it on headlights as you will lose light output and range, but to each his own. The only problem I had when I unrolled this tint is that there were creases with air pockets on the adhesive side of the tint. The air oxidizes the adhesive leaving noticeable patches on the underside after it has been applied, I almost used up Half the roll in order to get a nice clean one cut out (see Pic) even then you will see up-close that there are adhesive blemishes, the pictures could not catch it as it was very light, but noticeable to the eye. All-in-all I wouldn't recommend this brand for windows (spend a little more for better quality) but for other little projects, it is great.

Fits 2015 Toyota Tundra Limited Extended Cab perfectly.  My truck came with just the standard power heated mirrors that came with the limited.  I just took my time and followed the instructions founded on YouTube.  It was as easy as taking two screws off the door panel, then three screws for the mirror.  It works great with the turn signals.  I have had no problem with the mirrors vibrating either retracted or extended.  The bottom blind spot mirror does adjust up and down but it takes more pressure to push it up or down than side to side.

Nice compact light. Installed as a glove box light on my 2017 Civic.  You can tap directly into the led illumination circuit. It dims along with the ambient light already there.  But be warned it might blow the original fuse.  In my case that was a 2 amp but once i upgraded it to a 3 amp it was OK, for now.  Some other hints.  If you happen to have a 15/64 drill that is the best size for the "6mm" version. Also if you want it dimmer than normal you can range from a 500 ohm or higher resistor.  A 500 ohm cuts the brightness by about half IMO.

Perfect fit. 10 second install, will not give your truck or suv more power. No air filter will give your motor more power unless specifically tuned to take in more air in fuel which doesn't happen dropping a air filter in. So don't expect any gains. Cheap decent reusable filter . That's all

These are working out perfectly for what I had in mind. I don't have a truck or SUV with a roof rack, so I mounted these on a very small trailer frame I've had lying around for a few years. I added pool noodles for extra cushioning and had to lengthen the trailer tongue and a couple of other small modifications to the frame. but everything worked out great. These J-Bars are very sturdy and are perfect for my kayaks.

So far, excellent.  A huge improvement over the stock battery monitor, relieves my battery anxiety on my class B.  It's accurate to my $150 Klein voltmeter.  The backlighting is not overly harsh, so I may just leave it on all the time.  Viewing angle is good enough, but of course test that out before permanently installing.My only beef is the pen button.  I will probably try and glue a small extension on it, since it will get used regularly, such as for resetting the energy meter when setting up camp.From this I should be able to get a good idea of the total Wh of the battery.  Voltage alone doesn't say much.The clips are designed for a thin panel.  To mount it on plywood, I cut the back side at the plug in at an angle to allow clearance for the wire terminals, and just made the rest a friction fit within the wood cutout.

This light is Great!  If I were just reviewing the light and how well it worked, I would give it five stars.  I give it four stars because of the tiny flimsy wires that it comes with make the installation more difficult than it should be and look like a future failure point if they should come under any stress at all.  I could not find anyplace to use the adhesive backing on my truck, so I instead fastened it to the semi-rigid underhood insulation with five of the zip ties that were supplied with it.  I have doubts that the adhesive would have held up to the high underhood temperatures anyway.  The wiring that is attached to the light is a very small gauge stranded pair.  I'm guessing that it is 28 gauge or smaller.  I was never successful getting the crimp connectors to hold to the tiny wire, so I gave up and soldered my connections.  (Makes a better connection anyway.)  Finding a place to put the hood switch was a bit of a problem because of the way GMC laid out the hood edges, but I finally made it work. Overall, I really like the light and am surprised at the amount of light that it puts out.  I highly recommend it.6/19/2018  Ok, I bought this light a year ago and installed it under the hood of my 2016 GMC Yukon XL.  The light itself is great, nice and bright and really lights things up.  I have lowered my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars for the following reasons:  1. The above mentioned flimsy wires. (I'll have to admit though, they haven't caused any problem since installation.)  2. The underhood switch that "automatically" turns on the light when you raise the hood is a poor quality switch and no longer turns on the light when you raise the hood.  You can giggle the switch and get the light to come on though.I still really like the light, but the company that put the kit together has cut a few too many corners if you ask me.

This add on to my 2015 corolla s plus was amazing!! In love with sound the moment i turned on the car after installation! It's no secret that every recent corolla model comes with computer system that monitors and records your fuel every trip, my highest before adding on the exhaust was 33.5mpg on city and with standard ECO mode, my new highest was 37.5mpg after the exhaust, and this was also in standard ECO mode during my regular commute to work! Like everyone has been saying! Worth every penny!! Made my car more masculine since it has turned heads by giving my car a louder and sportier vibe!!

Fitment was poor due to the rubber being a lot thicker than my existing Fram filter. I do remember the Fram filter being dimensionally identical to my OEM air filters.  I will say the fins are held together by metal instead of plastic like other filters so that was good. Also the actual filter media was deeper. Due to the airbox design in my case it did not make installation hard, just the plastic. I wonder if the extra media will cause more of a restriction. I was still able to make it work but it took a lot of force. I would have returned it but my local auto parts store was out of stock. I wouldn't buy again.

They are definitely brighter and look better than the stock halogen lights. However the lights does not travel as far, it seems a bit uncontrolled I suspect this would not be an issue if they were in a projector type housing rather than a reflector housing. quality seems good, fit perfectly in both housing and connector. 6500k color temp bright white with a hint of blue.

*** UPDATE 03/01/2016 ***I purchased another one of these and took some pictures of the packaging, as some people complained about the packaging. Both of my examples have been excellent. The picture shows the plastic a little loose as I cut open a small section so I could get the seal out where it was visible for the photo, but prior to that, the plastic was very tight. You can see the ACDelco label on it, too, in one of the photos - it's a genuine part (sometimes you get fakes/3rd party parts). The box it came in was appropriately sized and it was by itself (ordering multiple items can sometimes get you a little bowling ball/missile type object thrown in the box that can really ruin things".*** Original Review Below ***Not sure about some other reviewers complaints, but I got a real AC Delco part, with GM instructions, with the exact same filter as the factory filter I pulled out. The packaging was really good- they shrink wrap the filter and gasket flat against a big piece of cardboard, so it can't shift, fold, pinch, get damaged, etc - and the gasket seems to be of good quality - it was a little thinner than the factory cork gasket, but it looked like a rubberized fiber type material that seems really sturdy. And the pan doesn't leak, so it's doing it's job. The filter fits perfectly, and it comes with a new seal (which I didn't use, because mine was good and was only a year old anyway).And if you're buying this - another tip - Amazon has Havoline Dexron VI for about $45 for a case of 12 - Prime shipping! That's super cheap. You can't afford not to change your filter and fluid at those prices. Buy 2 cases, flush out the bad via the cooler lines, which took 18 quarts for me, then drop the pan and change the filter and add more fluid. Yeah, you wasted 4 to 5 quarts, but it's the cleanest way to go.

I bought this regulator just over three years ago, in June 2013. In August 2106, it no longer works, having made a horrible sound during its death throes, followed by dead silence. It's not even trying to work. Worse, the TYC "limited lifetime warranty" is useless. Why? "This warranty applies only to those products which have been installed in accordance with accepted industry standards by a RECOGNIZED SERVICE DEALER and CERTIFIED TECHNICIAN." Since I hold no paper diploma from ASE and did the repair in my driveway, it just doesn't apply..I've uploaded photos of the TYC regulator. I was astonished at the number of cracks in the plastic carrier that rides on the rail after just 3 years of use. Based on the horrible noise it makes, I'd imagine the gears inside the motor housing are made of similar material and have cracked and chipped away.I have replaced the TYC unit with the Dorman 741-762 (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000C11JLQ ), purchased locally. The local place was more expensive but included a lifetime replacement warranty on it. The Dorman still has the plastic carrier, but the unit seems a bit more robust overall. Of note is that the Dorman operates more smoothly and with greater power than the TYC ever did.I won't be buying another TYC window regulator.

"Beautiful" is a strange term for utilitarian products like hitches but the design of this is truly a work of art.  I've owned dozens of the nasty black (then rusty) hitches (I owned an equipment rental store)--your hands get dirty handling them then you put your nasty hands on your high-dollar leather-wrapped steering wheel--no such problem here.  I bought this hitch and a stainless steel ball (from Amazon, naturally) because I wanted the business end of my 2013 Avalanche to look as good as the rest of the truck.  Yeah, it costs maybe 20 bucks more than the nasty hitch but what did you pay for your truck?  Another benefit is that this hitch is rated for heavier tow loads than most steel hitches.  Buy this; you'll be happy!Update 3 years later: Still looks great (including stainless ball) after three salty Ohio winters.  It's no longer shiny like new but not expected to be so since it's just a mill finish--the picture is of the actual hitch and ball in May, 2016 after many miles and 3 winters.  The rust on the ball isn't from the ball, its from the hitch on the trailer.

Fits our 2013 Highlander just fine.  Quality as always as I use their oil filter and cabin filter for my 2013 WRX as well.  If you're going to install this yourself, make sure you have 10mm socket with a long extension to get to the bolt on the back side.  Otherwise just loosen the two bolts (which also doesn't fall out) and pop the cover to the left enough to pull the old filter out and put the new one in.Notice there's a rounded corner on one side so match that to slide it in the correct way.  Easy 2-minite job that the stealership will charge $40+ for!

I was looking for a bed extender and AMP absolutely fits the bill.  I installed this on a 2014 Tacoma and it will work on many trucks.  Very light weight. Be advised, the new bed extenders are now angled at the corners, not squared off.  Apparently, the NHTSA - National Highway Transportation Admin, revised their rules to angle these so as not to block brake lights.I found a YouTube video of an install that was useful, but I dint think Amazon will allow posting the link.  Therefore, I'll do a walk thru.  This kit is very easy to assemble.  Be on the lookout for a piece of the cardboard packaging that has a 7" template piece.  You will use this to measure 7" from the end of each of the three bars.  Put a piece of tape (masking) at the 7" mark.  The purpose is so when you assemble the tubes into the ends, you can eye even spacing.  I found when I assembled, the tubes inserted right up to the tape and made the extender perfect width for mounting.Another note, there are two frame brackets for the three bars.  Look closing at the inside that will last flush with the bars.  There are 6 ribs inside.  You'll notice 2 are larger, 4 shallower. This is because when you slide the tubs into the ends, the end bars are larger, the inserted tubes smaller.  So, if your brackets aren't a tight fit, check to ensure the brackets are place correctly.  Thks isn't noted in the directions.The extender comes with the standard mounting bracket. I upgraded and ordered the quick release set. I like having the added locked in feature.Templates - the kit comes with two paper templates, small and large. Small is for small trucks, large for large. That said, I used the small, but once mounted, the extender wasn't level, but tilted. I then used the large template and all worked out great.  So, tape each in place and put your assembled extender on the tailgate and you'll be able to quickly see which template is best.Oh, I have two pics of the round tabs that hold in the tailgate latch.  For the 2014 Tacoma, you need to remove the larger ones that are on the straps and install the smaller ones; they do come with the kit for the change out.I really like this extender.  It took me about an hour and it's a lot easier than it sounds.

Great tuner. I have V&H short shots and Screaming eagle heavy breather air cleaner on my 2015 HD forty-eight. I had a cobra Powrpro Fi2000 auto tuner on the bike and I still had decel pop and slight hesitation just off idle when taking off. Put the V&H fuelpak on and it got rid off all that. Best investment on the bike!

I went four stars for wiring guage.I installed these on a custom license plate bracket that I made (I do recommend some blue thread lock). I've hade then on for a few months and that have been through some wet weather and still function fine and have no rust on them.They are bright enough to light up the license plate (as you can see in the picture, that is in a parking garage at about 2 in the afternoon) and I like the color temperature of the leds. They were easy to install and had plenty of wire to (I had to trim it) to reach to my splice location. As someone else said, plan on using some sort of wire connector or quick disconnect for them because if you splice them straight in, you will not be able to remove your license plate with out cutting the wires.I only have two issues,  one of which was my fault.  1) the wiring guage is pretty small. A heavier guage would have been preferred.  2) the way I installed then the wire that comes out of the threaded extension was rubbing in the fender frame causing the thin guage wire coating to get cut/worn exposing the wire. Again this is not the sellers fault by my installation. My remedy was to fill the end of the thread hole with some liquid electrical tape and zip tie some rubber bushings behind the license plate bracket to keep it from rubbing.

Sometimes I'd like to use my bike to discover new paths but it's difficult to know how to get back without using the phone GPS . I had a ram mount and smart phones are notorious with battery consumption so I thought of getting a power outlet.This one has a good material. Feels rigid and not cheap. Besides, main cable is wrapped for protection with easy replaceable fuse.I liked the on-off switch which is a must to not drain the battery if not used for extended amount of time.Another thing I liked is the wire can be split from the middle to form a battery tender cable so it's two in one function.I ride a Suzuki sv650s which has the handle bar pretty much crowded, though, managed to squeeze it perfectly on the brake stem.Will upload a picture.another thing to add is how easy it is now to inflate the tires without having to park next to my car or get a cord extension. this one has a 15 amp fuse and the air compressor used has a 20 amp fuse. works great.P.S : don't have a problem with the cover bouncing under the air flow because the sport bike is more aero dynamic. I recommend using a rubber band to keep the cover in place.P.S.S : one can use a Teflon to wrap it underneath the clip so it would be gentle and not to harm the handle bar.

OEM Honda are ridiculously expensive for a 20 year old car. So I took a chance on this based on other people's reviews & price. I actually bought complete set for a 96 Civic DX. I'm really glad I did. Drives and sounds like a New car again. No more vibrations & rattles. Just a smooth drive. This rear mount went in with ease no modification needed. As for durability, I will have to check back in. Over all I'm satisfied so far.

Struts were a perfect fit and an absolute breeze to install. My old struts were still OK but the springs were losing their stiffness resulting in a lower ride height. I figured I best replace them before any issues arise.Total installation time for both sides was just a touch over 1 hour total (30mins a side). Air tools and impact sockets help alot but the tasks can be accomplished with hand tools. I did not notice a significant change in alignment but its always best to get it checked to avoid unnecessary tire wear.

These definitely do not fit in the normal fuse holders but man, I was so sick of replacing fuses any time I had to test a connection or something.  These things work great!  No more wasting fuses while you're working on something.I'm using mine to control the power to my air compressor for a set of train horns.  I have a ViAir 450 hooked into this and have been successfully using the two together for about 3 months now.  No issues so far.See pictures for a comparison between normal fuses and this breaker as well as how I trimmed the holder for it to fit.  The cover will not clip down on both sides but it's worth the sacrifice in my opinion.

I was intrigued when I saw other reviews saying it was flimsy and lightweight- but I ordered 2 of them to use as cabinets in my car race trailer.  Very pleased with this arrangement and they worked out beautifully.  Added power lifter to keep the lid in the up position easily (they are permanently mounted to the wall.I can understand being disappointed if people bought these as a regular truck bed box- however they worked brilliantly for my purpose

I refuse to ding a sellers rating due to issues caused by the carrier...and in general, I hate reading reviews that only say 'fast shipping!'...in this case that has nothing to do with if this product is going to stop my truck better than my stock setup. That being said, my first set did arrive UPS ground...and by ground, i mean it looked like they drug them behind their truck on the ground. Boxes were destroyed...i literally didn't have to open them, they were already opened from damage...weird thing though the box that was in the worst condition contained two of the rotors, the better of the two boxes was missing a rotor before it went to rewrap at ups to received several yards of packing tape.  Granted, these rotors weigh 26 lbs each, so at 52 lbs per box...its going to be hard to contain the items without a wood frame or something simular. Nothing was damaged and the pads were in their own box and were well protected. This is where I give 21 motorsports 5 stars; once I contacted them Justin responded in a short time and through much back and forth he always responded promptly and once i determined it was the driver rear rotor i was missing he just shipped me an entire additional rear set, two rotors and another set of pads. Great job justin.Now for the product review; 5 stars! After completing the break in procedure, I can easily tell there is a big improvement in breaking. It takes less pedal pressure to stop the truck now than before (and i thought my old pads were nearing their end of life but all 4 corners had half the pad thickness left, so it's not like I'm comparing new brakes to worn out brakes.  I never liked how my trucks brakes felt and in an emergency stop you really had to stand on them...not any more. I probably won't haul real heavy for a few months when i start hauling round bales at 11-13k lbs but i will be hauling my 7k lb 21x8 enclosed toy hauler in the next couple of weeks and will report back.After much shopping online, nobody could touch their price.I have at 1500 z71 and a ford expedition also, when they're due for a brake job I'm buying again from 21 motorsports and both will be getting complete Power Stop brake kits.

Wow, what a difference!  I added photos of my side by side dome lights with the new and the OEM (original equipment).  You can see the difference but the photos don't do the new LEDs justice.  They are so much more bright and white than the OEM lights, huge difference.  The auto parts store wanted $5 for two OEM type so it would have been $25 + tax + driving to the store, these were less than $9 for 10.  I have only installed 3 and they all worked.  Even if a few don't work I am still very happy.  I don't write a lot of reviews but I found these to be an exceptional bargain and the performance surpassed my expectations.  We have several cars and I will be replacing all OEM bulbs with these, when I get around to it....

I ran these to protect my fuel pump circuit on my race car. Had them a couple inches from the input side of my two fuel pump relays. I was taking a short drive tonight and saw/smelled smoke come up from behind my seat. Shortly after, the engine died because the wire completely melted off the holder and the insulation was burning. I believe it is either low quality wire or a poor connection between the wire and the fuse holder. The 25 amp fuse I had in the holder didn't blow so the wire failed below 25 amps.

I bought this for my husband's vehicle, which he bought used with a broken windshield and no rear view mirror.  The one that came with the car had map lights only but they used a always on wire so I could only use the grounding wire from that set for this mirror.  The installation was fairly simple and took me less than 2 hours.  I didn't use their method to tap into an existing wire but wired it into a switched fuse at the fuse box using a fuse tap instead.  As some others have mentioned, the hardest part can be running the wires under the trim.  The headliner on his vehicle is very tight and wouldn't come loose in the area over the rear view mirror and I didn't want to force it and break something so I just ran them as far as I could under the headliner and used something I had hanging around the house to make a cover for the rest of the wires since there was an existing ground already coming out of the headliner.  I soldered the mirror ground wire onto the existing vehicle ground wire.  Some others have mentioned the temp sensor wires, making sure they are pushed in far enough into the pin locations.  They also have to be put in the right way up and then pushed in until  they click.  Once installed, it took 3 slow circles in a parking lot to calibrate the mirror.  Everything appears to be working at this point.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the map lights aren't as bright as I had hoped for but they work.  I can't speak of longevity yet.  I will come back later and update after the mirror has been used for several months.  I like the way it looks and am glad it shows both temp and direction on the same screen instead of having to toggle through the options to get to one or the other.  Quick update, my husband was able to get the wires up into the headliner closer to the mirror (second picture)....  I left the first because you can see the temp and direction in it.

Ok so idk how many times I've been stranded places because I don't have stuff like this. I've had nails and screws in my tires that run me flat and left me stranded. I've had dead batteries. I've had blown tires. I've had where my car just wouldn't start because of an alternator and starter and other things and nothing to tow it back, so I'd have to pay a tow truck. Ugh. But I saw this and I wanted it so bad. I am a mom of 3 and we are always on the go. I work part time and we go on lots of road trips or day trips in town and out of town and it's the worst thing to be stuck with 3 kids, especially in a no cell service zone. This bag full of goodies is going to be a lifesaver. I know it.I love that it comes in a really well made and thick fabric bag with handles. Makes it easy to carry, plus it unzips to fold out flat.There is soooo much to this kit. A tire plug kit, a small compressor, a tow strap, caution stand, jumper cables, bungee cords, zip ties, gloves, electrical tape, a tool thing like a leatherman, a mini head lamp, and a first aid kit.This makes me and my husband feel safer when we leave the house. I know the basics of how to use all this stuff now as he showed me to make sure. I seriously think this kit should be a standard in every car. It would also be a great gift for new teenage drivers. Or if you have someone who got a new car, get them this as a new car homing gift. :) Everything in the bag is really well made too. It's not just cheap stuff thrown in. The tow strap is thick and heavy duty and we tested it out for fun out at my in laws. Someone is always getting stuck in the mud or snow here anyway. And I don't know how any times I've had neighbors ask me if I had jumper cables. Now I do. I am not the most skilled person in car mechanics but I do know how to use all of this and it will help me when the time comes. I love this kit.I did get to try this free but these are my own opinions and experiences.

My mechanic uses this brand and says we all need to replace them in Spring and Winter, regardless of miles driven or conditions of driving. He recommends this brand because of the price and the fact that they are 99.5% filtration. The air quality in the car is noticeably improved when using Ecogard. You WILL notice the improvement! Order a stack of them to keep in your home and replace them on schedule. You'll thank me later for improved health and driving!Factory filters include what's called 'bypass holes'. If the filter gets too dirty then the air simply bypasses the filter, essentially filling the cabin full of toxic air from the road. I assume manufacturers do this knowing people don't bother to change them and hence, prolonging the life of the blower. (at the expense of your health and longevity) Aftermarket, quality filters like Ecogard DO NOT have bypass holes! Here's a picture of the manufacturers 'reckless' use of holes to bypass filtration if filters get dirty.

Someone actually welded the shaft on wrong, the holes are on the top and bottom and not the sides. It's has to be some kind of a joke that someone played on the job unless they are blind. But it does show CURT has no quality control. Rather than go through the experience of Amazon return I took it to a shop and spent $15 having it drilled correctly. Nice Joke Amazon!

 I purchased this for a 2000 VW Jetta 2.0 GL AEG 5 speed transmission. I was changing the fuel pump and decided to change most/all fuel system related components, fuel injectors and 'rotten' worn out engine fuel hoses and the fuel filter. I have also done a review of the Mann WK731 Fuel Filter which I also bought on Amazon.  This part is a direct fit on my 2000 VW Jetta 2.0 AEG. It replaces the original fuel pressure regulator, which is (was) also a Bosch.  If you are doing the work yourself, consult the Haynes or other manual to show or instruct you on how to go about changing it. On a scale of 1-10 where 1 is changing a fuse and 10 is changing an engine, this replacement is a 2 at the very most.  To replace the fuel pressure regulator, remove the engine cover, relieve the fuel pressure and disconnect all attached hoses. Pull out the pin that holds the fuel pressure regulator in place with a regular flat screwdriver. Once the pin is pulled out, pull out the regulator with the same screwdriver, easing it out of its black plastic fuel rail holder. Make sure you have the regulator and both the small and big o rings out of the holder.  On the new regulator, as per the manual, apply a thin film of engine oil (I used Castro 5W 30 but you can use any engine oil) on both the small and large o rings and then push the regulator into its holder. When it is in there, it will 'snap' and feel in place. Push the pin back, put back the connecting hoses just as you had removed then and once done with all your other installations, start the car and enjoy. Good luck if you are doing the job yourself. I have attached a few pictures showing that it is similar and a direct fit to the previous original part, where the fuel regulator is in the car and how to instal it. I was working on other parts of the car and the pictures might show a part called the intake plenum manifold removed. You don't have to do this (remove the intake plenum) for this replacement. Hope it helps.

I've been through quite a few brands of "festoon" style LED bulbs and I can honestly say, these are the brightest, whitest and most durable I've ever come across. I bought the 330 lumen ones and they too are wicked bright! But if you want to blast your whole cabin or cargo area up with enough light to probably grow questionable "herbs" in, then these are for you. WARNING: Do not install these in map lights that are close to your face, because when you turn these on, your night vision will go right out the window! After seeing first hand how bright these are, I  "modified" (bent the piss out of the clips) my Honda Accord's dome light to make these things fit and it was well worth it! Yes, there's some slight buzzing/whining if your vehicle has the auto fade/dim out feature but, it's honestly not that bad; lasts a whole 2-3 seconds. I even disassembled the ends of one to adapt it to fit a horizontal style dome light in a 2003 Dodge Ram single cab; 194 wedge style base. For those of you who own said truck, mod these to work in your dome light and never look back... literally. You can take even the best 194/168 LED replacement for horizontal dome lights and multiply it's output four times and it still wouldn't touch the brightness these things put out. Just buy them and make them fit however you can!

It's a nice bumper. My issue is the paint is starting to peel off.  I don't go off road. Only had this around 2 years. Some of the locations this is happening is on the top part of the bumper, not the front where a rock could of directly hit it. Will need to touch this up before it spreads.

These are TERRIBLE.First problem is that all 24 of them have a big sticker put over the reflective face. Great placement. I wanted to spend half hour with a heat gun screwing around with these before I could use them.Second problem is that THEY DON'T REFLECT. Not at all. Complete garbage. So now I guess I'll pull them all out of the ground, repackage them, and send them back to Amazon.30 minutes screwing with stickers. 30-45 minutes placing 24 fake-reflectors. 5 minutes driving back and forth in the dark wondering how in the world these can be made and sold. Now it'll be another 20 minutes pulling them out, plus my packaging and shipping time. Even with a return I've been ripped off for two hours of my time. The ground is about to freeze over, and I still don't have anything marking the driveway.DO NOT BUY THESE!!

The key shell worked well for replacing a cracked 2007 Accord case. The buttons and key fit well and are snug. Only con is the area where you put the transponder from the old key. The chip is pretty small but the area in the new shell is much bigger so it moves and rattles around in there. The key works to start the car though, no issues there.

Just installed these yesterday and so far so good. Was looking for a kit with 9012 Bulbs for a 2014 Chevy Volt. I had ordered a kit previously from another seller that states that 9006 would work with my car, well they won't. Sent that kit back. Before I ordered a kit from INNOVITED I contacted them first to make sure they had what I needed. They responded back very quickly, sent me a link to one of their kits on Amazon that had everything I needed to install. The kit they pointed me too didn't have my bulbs on the drop down to select the bulb type. They assured me that, they would put the 9012 bulbs in the kit for me. Received the kit in a few days, everything was there, everything hooked up fine. On my 2014 volt I did have to hook the connectors up reverse for the bulbs to come on. The instructions state that in the trouble shooting section. Highly recommend Innovited for their customer service! Haven't had the kit on long enough to tell you the long life of it. The bulbs look great and everything seems solid. My pics show the passenger side with the stock halogen bulb and the drivers side with the 5000k HID kit Bulb. The last pic is both installed.

At first, with an H1 bulb, with no modification, these are very spotty with an off center hot spot. I decided to correct things and ended up getting a fantastic, Lexus like, OEM cutoff and output.First thing was to sand down the surface where the bulb meets the housing. It was rough and uneven. With a little trial and error of moving the bulb up and down and side to side, you can see where you need to grind to achieve that nice, centered hotspot.Second, I personally did not like that DOT style cutoff, so I sanded it flat. My truck sits high enough that a DOT cutoff has no effect besides looking stupid.Third, I had to slightly tweak the cutoff shield to get a gorgeous intense purple/blue cutoff. Bend it slightly forward or backwards to get out crisp as well.And forth, take it all apart and clean it.In the end, a cheap projector with a little tweaking made me forget about ever spending $250 plus for a name brand projector.

I purchased this product to install Mountain insignias on the sides of my Jeep. It was supposed to allow positioning of the stickers before adhesion. However, after receiving this product and reading the label, I found that this company requires that you buy another product to clean the surface of the vehicle. The cost would begin to escalate and was not worth it, Therefore I didn't use this product. I simply used alcohol, then applied the stickers the old fashioned way; by eye and a steady hand. It came out perfect. I did not use this product, so it was a waste of money for me.

First time vinyl wrapping. Probably took on a more difficult tasks than I should but with the help of my son, worked out perfect. I can't compare with any other brand but I advise having a helper and watch a ton of videos. Never used the tool they sell either. Used my hands and a heat gun. Trick is to not be afraid of working the material. Results are awesome but I can understand how and why people get frustrated. Be patient. The picture shows my daughter's speaker surround. It's curves and they had a flat ledge up top. Talk about a hard project for a beginner!  Whatever you do, but twice the material you assume. I had to start over because I didn't measure correctly. The material stretches nicely and will not rip as long as you have it properly heated. I still have to do the other side but can't wait to surprise my daughter. :)

My light bar came in today, the shipping was fast and I couldn't wait to install it. The build quality is great and its bright as crap. I am going to wait till tonight to actually test it out at night. But, so far its a great Led Light Bar, the only problem I noticed was when I was looking at the lens I noticed on the inside of the lens that there was streaks all over the lens. So I don't know if I got a refurbish light bar or it was just a mistake. It looks like someone took windex and left streaks all over the inside of it. But, Im not going to worry about it unless it leaks on me. But, hopefully it'll last. I did measure the light bar and it was around 49 inches for me. I bought the cheap EYourLife Mounting Bracket and it fits great.

Excellent, bright LED bulb at a good price point. Just got them, had a bulb that needed replaced in the Driving lights for my 2004 F150 Fx4, decided to go LED, and while looking around also picked these instead of white to change the look a little. Was a little concerned how it would look with smoke lenses but it turned out to look great and much brighter than stock bulbs. I have uploaded a photo that shows a single bulb installed taken in full daylight to compare to the standard bulb.

these are one of my favorite purchases online. at 1200 lumens they might not go out as far as possible however, the sheer number of leds coupled with the projector on the end make for a great look and significant light for a plug and play bulb. I think all led bulbs should have this design scaled to their particular application. then work on bumping up the lumens to around 2-3000 lumens per bulb for headlights. Anyways i highly recommend this product and i have tried many oem options for bulbs and these are bright. color is like 6000k a little cool on the colors 5000k perfect white. I balance mine by running different staggered temps in different bulbs low/high/fog. now switch to leds has got me all at 6k. the market really needs to get there and make the right lumens led bulbs that don't need extra ballast. then they could just offer good plug and play bulbs in different colors/temps. also these even look good off.

The instructions came pretty straight forward. It was a fun install and it sounds throaty and deep ! I get heads turning everywhere I go. I must say the hardest part is getting the old exhaust off. Especially for me since I live in an area where everything rusts, I had quite the struggle and went through 2 cans of WD-40. Definitely recommended for anyone with a JK since the factory system sounds like a grandma car.  aFe are on top of their game with products like this.

Installation on my 2015 Ram Laramie was easy.  The step cleared the dual exhaust tailpipe without the need to adjust the tailpipe as described in the installation instructions.  I'm 5'3" with short legs and I could not get up into the bed of my truck without this...works great!

PERFECT color temperatureright in between a cool white and warm white.  Excellent output.  See my photo to get an idea.Also, can tell it's a high-quality unit in all my years experience of automotive LED.  No flickering, no inconsistency between the two in color temperature, and been going strong for 6 months now.

I have purchased two oil filter wrenches for my 2009 Corolla (on Amazon). I have attached a photo of both. The first one (gray/left) was a dissapointment. It was not a tight and would slip off every time. I was not able to remove the filter.  I purchased the Ibetter and the fit is tigher and has additional teeth that really grab on to the oil filter cap. It did not break. Recommend!

Could not be more happy with these little lights. And I mean little. I knew they were small by the description, but to give you a perspective, they are no bigger than a credit card. But the quality seems very well for the PRICE key word there.  I will update as time goes on for how well these hold up.

Picked up my 2017 truck this morning, installed cover an hour later. Fits great. Dealer warned me that 2016 covers wouldn't fit a 2017 but I saw other people using these on 2017s happily. Mine sure fits great. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because one seam is not straight in a 6" section. Not enough to keep me up at night but it kept this from perfection. Would buy again.

How are you supposed to mount these when they don't send a left and a right, they send 2 lefts, so it won't look symetrical at all when mounted on a bumper. I was going to mount these on an ATV but I don't have the room to have the cord coming out on the "outside" on the right light, when the left light the cord comes out to the center of the vehicle. (Like it should.)For the price I guess I shouldnt expect a super high level of detail like that, and Im sure I can make it work but having the wire come out in the center would solve this issue.

Absolutely AWESOME product! Thank you to Adam from Wizards for suggesting this product for my Ranger Z520! I used the Supreme Seal as the base and used this next and it is an amazing gloss! Super easy to use with amazing results, it is super slick and easy to clean finger prints and oils off the finish

I was skeptical to purchase the Meguiar's Ultimate Black, but the trim on my F150 was getting faded with the sun and I needed to try something.  I am extremely pleased with the results.  I followed the directions on the bottle with great results.-I used it on mirrors, black bumpers, the front grill (took some time), and all of my window trim (including the rubber)-No need for buffing, and the results have lasted a few weeks-My trim is black, but I also used it on some faded painted surfaces and the vinyl seat of my tractor and they look brand new.I highly recommend this, your car will look like the day you brought it home.

It's frame is solid and high quality plastic.However, it's not so bright, I use multi-meter to measure current as 90mA on 12V, so it's about 1W.Next, tear down, I found there is no any seal glue or rubber between the base and cover. Also, led is 5050, I know why it's not so bright. Finally, I found a 91ohm resister which is underpowered, for this size resistor, usually 1/16W, but the real power is 0.22W, so I am considering change this resistor.I will update when I totally modify it.

on a 07 jk jeep wrangler you will need shims to mount the brackets to hood.other wise the bracket will bend at the bottom and will be crooked.other than that they are nicely built heavy duty brackets.so keep in mind about the shims.

These were reasonably priced and a decent quality item as mentioned by others.I attached a set of Anderson Power Pole connectors to them and it made it easy to hook up a Watt Meter to see how many watts they draw.It read 17 - 20 watts and the light output is very decent.Using a -'50 watt solar panel/charge controller/12 volt battery' set up -you could power two of these easily all day for free as garage work lights.A set may find their way to our D4 Caterpillar and I might even put them on the back as well.We may buy more in the future.

I have ordered from this company twice now a month apart and have 3 sets of these stickers. They are printed on 3m material(some don't say 3m depending on where they were on the cut sheet, but you can tell they are from the same sheet because of other marks on the backing.) They arereflective at night and they are the quality I expected.  I had a question about my order and Adam answered me right away and was veryprofessional. Great customer service. I posted some pictures, one with a flash, to try and show that it is reflective, and the size etc.

Update: It's been about 3 months since I applied 845. The beading has dimnished a bit, going from small tight beads to larger globs, but it still repels rain and makes for easy cleanup of dirt/grime. I think it would last an entire season with no problem.But after recently trying 915, I will only be using 845 as a winter prep wax. In my opinion, 915 is easier to use and has a much better finish, but I doubt it would hold up as well through harsh winters.I think 845 is a durable wax with a slight learning curve; it can become an oily hologram-y mess if applied too heavily, which I found out the hard way after touching up an area.Bottom line is this: 845 for durability that lasts as long as ULW (or longer), 915 for maximum gloss and depth, possibly with limited protection due to much higher carnauba content. More frequent applications won't be a bad thing, 915 smells better and is easy to work with! This is just my take though, your experiences may vary.************After using Meguiar's ultimate liquid wax for a while, I had to see what all the hype was about with this wax.I transferred the contents into a clear condiment bottle first. It makes using this runny liquid MUCH easier! Smells kinda like Raid spray, not as pleasant as ULW. I washed and clayed the entire car, then applied the wax by hand with a microfiber applicator pad. It spreads easily, and looks pretty greasy upon application. On a cool surface, it hazes in about 10 minutes. It takes just a tiny bit of elbow grease to remove, but the results are worth it; slick surfaces and no stained black trim!It looks just as good as ULW on a white car, but others may get different results with darker colors. Overall I think it's a good wax that should hold up through the spring and maybe through the summer. I'll update my review about longevity to see if it lasts as long as ULW.

GREAT set of tie down straps.  Not flimsy nor stiff, have a solid quality feel to the straps.  Rachets work beautifully.  Love the added loop if you are using on something you don't want rubbed or abraded by the load.  Easy release, no struggle at all.  These are better quality straps than the ones this size sold at Lowes.  I keep these in the truck for hauling loads, especially since furniture and appliance stores will no longer tie down loads for you out of legality issues.

I purchased this kit for a 2016 Nissan Altima SR without LED package.Installation was a little more complicated than other HID kits, but this kit installs with a relay system that is more reliable and performs better than the straight plug and play balast kits.My installation time was a little lengthy at around 2 hours, but i did a lot of disassembly of the engine bay and inner fender wells to access the headlights themselves easier. Disassembling the engine bay helped to keep the wiring for the relay harness as neat as possible for a more "factory" look.The supplied extra length wiring helped to route most of the wiring along the same paths as the factory wiring that helped give this a much cleaner looking install than other kits i have installed previously.A helpful tip for anyone installing this into a similar Altima. The harness from the supplied relay that plugs into the Nissan factory headlight harness (only 1 of the factory headlight plugs gets connected with the relay setup) needs to have the connections reversed to match the factory wiring. To do this there are 2 small tabs inside the harness on the inside of each connector (towards the middle of the plug) press the tab with a small screwdriver to release the connectors from each side, reverse them inside the connector and connect them to your factory headlight harness.Overall this was a great kit that provided great looking results!

This is great for motorcycle fairings. Whether it's a race bike or for street, if you are getting engine heat around your legs near the cylinder heads this may help. I put some on the inside of my upper fairing and it worked like a charm. Just ordered another roll to keep handy.

TL;DR: Without mounting this very high or far back (away from where your garage motor plug typically would be), this couldn't reach both cars in a practical way. However, 2 lasers made the more difficult parking situation more workable than one laser, so I can at least park 1 of our 2 cars very precisely. That precision helps the 2nd car have more elbow room and both people/cars are happy, so overall this product still achieved the goal.DETAILS:This is ok. Good: price, sturdy enough build (the lasers won't wobble loose), mostly good sensor detection, light to mount and easily plugs in where your garage lift motor does. I was able to find a creative way to attach it to the garage motor framework thanks to its size and mounting points.Cons: there are a few reviews mentioning this is actually a difficult product to use in a garage with two vehicles because the lasers can't angle far enough -- I 100% agree. Can you separate the two laser heads enough to reach 2 cars? Yes, if your cars are close together -- for example, my garage doesn't have divided garage doors and the cars are about 3-4ft apart and that wasn't close enough. And yes, if you are targeting these at something on the far edges of your cars. For example, if you target this on the driver's mirror of one car, and the passenger mirror of the other. That makes your options much more limited, though, and half the time one of you will park a few inches too far one way or another and miss the laser -- think about trying to line up your mirror with a laser dot every time you park in the kind of tight/tricky space this laser is designed for. Picture it. Yeah, exactly.Ended up pointing both lasers onto one car that has the tougher job, parking at a slight angle. For my application, my gigantic vehicle with horrendous parking visibility (a hulk-hooded Challenger) only has about 5 combined inches between front and back bumpers... With only 1 of the lasers pointed, I couldn't get a safe read on how far forward or back I was because the laser was at such a crazy angle (trying to stretch this device to point at 2 cars) it would hit the car at a different lateral point if I came in slightly off-target from the laser... No confidence in my longitudinal position. With both lasers forming a "line," I can much more consistently gauge how far forward/back it is. This also freed me to position the entire device facing toward one car and for that application, the amount of angle in the two lasers worked great.What about the other car? Well, the second car has a little more elbow room. As long as these double lasers help me line up the tricky one, the other car has a consistent amount of space, and my car as a reference point. I haven't hit anything trusting this thing... yet!

This stuff obviously works great on glass and windows. But I just bought a 16 year old Altima for my daughter's first car. A great test for Chemical Guys. The one thing I kept looking at was the gauge pod. The plastic was so hazy it looked like it had been in the sun for 16 years. You could barely see into it it was so hazy. I thought of this stuff and figured what the heck. I put it on and...I can't even see the plastic cover. It's like it disappeared. Used this and a Chemical Guys microfiber towel to apply and used clean side to wipe off. Two minutes wiped off 16 years of wear. Great stuff. Wish I had a before shot...but you see the mileage and the clarity.

This is a 5-star steering wheel cover. Although, it took me about 4 hours to install, I don't regret that I spent so much time -- the end result is much better than "easy slip-on" covers that make steering wheels larger -- I have small-to-medium-sized hands, and don't need an enormously-thick steering wheel. I measured the steering wheel in my '08 Honda Accord Sedan and it is 14.5" (outside diameter) by 4.5" around thumb rests (thickest part), and the M+ size fits perfectly. The provided instructions are very helpful. The installation could have taken less time if I didn't forget small pliers -- it would make pulling the needle much faster.

Great price.  Needed slight modification to outer flange holes to fit on the studs (holes were too close together and needed to be bored out).  Other than this product fit perfectly.  The gasket it came with worked just fine and the seal is great.  It has been on the jeep for about 24 hours now.  Install is fairly easy just takes time would highly recommend to anyone with some mechanical ability who is looking to avoid 8 hours of shop cost.  I would also consider replacing the down pipe (and the rest of the exhaust system) at the same time like I did.  This is the only header you should buy for a Jeep TJ 4.0L.

UPDATE: 7/5/16When I attempted to take it out to swap vents, it would not come out using the OEM technique. I had to go through the fuse box to get it out. Way too much trouble. Stick to OEM.  This was the end resultI've got an mk4 Jetta vr6 and it works great. It feels kinda "spongy" compared to the OEM one, as in it doesn't have that click you feel/hear when you turn it, but other than that it is great so far.

There are several people on here telling you not to buy this meter since it is very cheaply made. Listen to them. They are right. I used $5 analog meters for years. I haven't seen an analog meter recently, but meters like this seems to have taken their place. But they seem to be less functional, and seem to be even less accurate.It will do for my purposes. But if you need accurate electronic measurements, then look for a better meter.I just said that it will do for my purposes. That may end up instead as me hoping that it will do for my purposes.Update Jan 9, 2016I have to apologize for the above information. I gave this meter an unfair review. I was using 3rd party leads with it, and evidently I was having a problem with the leads and not the meter. The meter is not 100 percent accurate, but it will get you close if you are using the leads which comes with it and not some bad ones as I had been when I 1st got it.And with continuity testing, the buzzer is below my hearing level....Update November 3, 2016In the comments, someone stated that this meter does not have a buzzer. I can only say that a buzzer is marked on the dial.

Pros:-Sticky as all heck. The material is so gummy that I attached this stand vertically to a window and it held my iPhone for over an hour. I finally had to leave the office but I left the stand attached to the window. It was there when I came back in this morning. I posted two pictures above - one with the iPhone in place and the other with just the stand..-Adjustable enough for driving in the car or while being used in the office. Works fine in landscape or portrait mode though the mount itself does not swivel.-Detaches easily enough when you want it to, but will not detach when you want it to stay stuck-Will work with ANY iPhone, Android or other mobile phone. You don't have to worry about getting a different one for every new version of the iPhone or Android you upgrade to.Cons-None so far.This is a GREAT device. I am hoping that they will make an iPad size version of this device. I highly recommend it. Ordered two more for frequent travelers in my office.

Good product, put it in yesterday morning and it works just perfect.The instructions are good enough, if you are someone that has ever done anything with electrics you will notice that the "Fig2 positive trigger" and "Fig3 negative trigger" are swapped. This is obvious at the bottom of both diagrams, where the positive trigger shows a ground symbol and the negative trigger has +12V written there. This should be the other way around.The door lock and unlock trigger can be configured to positive/+ trigger or negative/- trigger easily, the only thing that is not adjustable is the trigger wire to flash the lights when locking/unlocking. The unit has two brown wires for that, both of them put out +12V for around half a second once when locking, two impulses of half a second each when unlocking. For my car that has a negative trigger wire for the hazard lights, I had to buy a little relay and wire that up to one of the brown wires of this unit.Another nice thing is that the unused cables can easily be removed from the plug by using a small screwdriver. Just push in the locking pin at the connector, and the cable can be pulled out of the connector very easily.The remotes look high quality and have a nice feel to them. When pressing any of the two buttons on them, a little blue LED lights up at the top of the remote.Attached is the instructions sheet that came with it.

I used this on my 2001 Honda CRV aftermarket  grill and it turned out great.  If you follow the instructions you will not have any problems.  I used the DupliColor CP199 primer and BCL0125 clear coat spray.  I then sanded it with 3M 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500 grit sandpaper and then finished it off with a DA Porter Cable rotary buffer and Wolfgang Total Swirl Remover.

These bulbs are quite poorly constructed. The light push and twist required to install the bulb was enough force to cause the bulb to separate. No excessive force used, just poor construction. I also bought 2 1156 bulbs from LUYED and those are constructed flawlessly and work fantastic, just can't say the same for these.PS: These ones were even $6 more than the 1156 bulbs and seem to have had half the effort put into construction!

This product is the absolute best engine bay dressing one could possibly get their hands on.Ive been using it for years now and I get jaw dropping reactions from others when raising the hood on my 20 year old Roadster for those wanting to see the engine. Once applied to a clean engine bay, this will reduce the time and energy spent on future cleaning or dusting off of the engine and simply reapply after wiping the dust off.

Installed in about an hour, (I'll tell you how), and that's because I had to go under my carpet to not show wires, find the right fuses, and find out where I wanted to place them. They're bright and it has lots of settings, also the music response is dope.One minor issue I had that you might not find an issue, is that all four light wires go directly into the control box you use to adjust the lights. This shows causes it to show a lot of wires, but the way my car is, I am the only one that sees them. It looks tacky, but for the price and quality, I ain't taking off a star for it.I've had them installed for about a week and they've been working fine. I'll update this if anything happens.How I installed them: (light electrictian skill required) there will be a black and red wire coming from the control box on the lights. Since I have an aftermarket radio, it was easy to find a constant 12v wire to tap into. (the color of this wire will vary depending on your car, you'll need to google your model and year to find out, it's easy). You can easily find the wire you need under your steering wheel or behind your radio. Google comes in clutch when it comes to finding wires. So I connected the control box's red wire to this constant 12v I found. My radio also came with a ground wire that I tapped the control box's black wire into as well.(use google to find your ground wire) >>>> Tapping into a constant 12v allows me to turn the lights on and off whenever I please, regardless of the car being turned on or off. <<<<There was little frustration when I installed it, Google came in clutch when I had to find which wires to tap into, and they look awesome. I get compliments all around. Really makes my car look like it belongs in a show.(My pictures are deceiving, they're actually very bright, it's just that I took these pictures from a snapchat video so it looks faded)

It didn't fit perfectly the first time but all I needed to do was trim down one edge and it fits like a glove. This is one product made by glowshift that's actually worth buying.

I bought this cover as a replacement for the dealer-printed one that came with my new Wrangler. The material is very high quality and it fits my 32" mud-terrain tire perfectly. I actually prefer the tire without a cover, but this will be great to have when I want to protect the spare.

2010 Mercedes GLK350Did the retrofit since mine was broken, did all the usual steps of checking fuses and wiring and determined that mine was broken. I placed a call to the dealer and they wanted $80 for the part, Amazon had it for $60, but at the end of the day I hated the adapter sticking out and wanted a cleaner OEM look for something more useful since the wife does not smoke. I bought the dual USB port from Amazon for $10. 99 with prime and it took approximately 10 minutes to install, I used the factory wiring plug from the old cigarette lighter for the install. The quick connects was included.So if anyone has a broken from 12v then this is an alternative for you, the install rating is beginner/novice level so everyone should be able to do this.The only thing wish was different is the light would light up white instead of blue.please leave me a helpful vote if you can.

I have a 12-volt solar panel system installed in my car, including batteries.  Roof space for panels is limited, so efficiency is important; MPPT charge controller, thick gauge wiring, and this inverter.  From this inverter I run a long extension cord to my tent where I power my work gear; monitors, laptop, and cell phone, totaling between 30-200 watts.  I also use it for a small electric blanket (150 watt) if I'm up late in the cold.  It works perfectly, and being pure sine is safe for my computer stuff.  Note that I usually do not ground this system and it works fine (not that I'm recommending this).Inverters have a peak efficiency which is at around 50% load.  If you look at the specifications of this on their site, it says peak efficiency is 90% at 50% load.  You can also Google "inverter efficiency curve" to see how it works.  Generally you want to be between 40-80% load.  That's why to get a smaller inverter.  I chose 300 watt because it fits my average usage profile perfectly.  At about 100 watts average draw, this inverter's fan doesn't even need to run, which is exactly what I wanted.  It's pretty quiet and cool.Pictures are of the inverter wired into my setup.Edit: I got my car stuck in 4 feet of snow (oops) and, in a rush to evacuate all my solar gear, I tore off the flat end of this inverter's included battery cable.  I emailed Samlex, this is almost a year after purchase, asking if they could send a replacement cable.  The next business day they had sent me one for free.  I'm impressed and will be targeting Samlex for future purchases like this.

Cheapest price around. They mounted really well, balanced easily and handle really well. They are a great fit for any older beetle.

If you're like me you need to make more than a few stops to get groceries. Like, sometime 5 or 6 stops. All in different cities. And the one thing that gets Hubby's goat more than anything are the "nickle-and-dime tactics" of markets that want you to pay for a bag. So thankfully, LK Baby offered us another car trunk organizer that has made our shopping trips a lot less frustrating.See, we both get when a city has decided to ban plastic grocery bags. The reasoning is specious at best and the results are marginal, but hey, it's pure profit for everyone involved (except the consumer). And charging for paper bags? When they're made from the cardboard boxes they get their products delivered in? Give me a break! So I'm sure I'm not the only person who had things rolling around in the trunk or back seat because you've gotten tired of everyone having their hand in your pocket. And LK Baby's organizer is a lifesaver, because their organizer is big, spacious, sturdy and oh-so-helpful getting stuff from the truck to the house. It's well-built and strong enough that we stuffed all our Costco purchases in it, and could easily carry everything in with no fear of dropping anything or the organizer being strained. It's covered in water resistant nylon fabric, which means cold things sweating, or light spills, are not a problem. The bottom is unfortunately not rubberized, unlike the other organizer I previously tested, though the carry handles on the sides are strong and sturdy and there are plastic feet on the bottom. You can customize the divider inside, or only open up half to minimize the space it takes up. I'm in love. And the dividers have done a fantastic job of keeping cold, warm, and non-food items all away from one another. There's room in the pockets for more stuff, on all sides, and should one feel the need, you could store everything you'd need for any roadside emergency in Starling's organizer, with room to spare. and when you're done with it, it folds right back up, nice and flat and takes up practically no space at all.We've bought cheap-o organizers for the car and truck before. They always fell apart, broke down, or weren't made to last and got tossed. But for only $19.99, you get a rock-solid trunk organizer that holds way more than you'd think, and does more than you can imagine.I received the above product(s) free of charge from LK Baby. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion. I received no other compensation for my review. My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.

Great cover worth more the aid for it I'm happy!. Obviously may not compare to the $1,000 cover out there but you get a good quality product.

The tires seem to track strange on hard pack dirt or wet dirt.  Its almost like there is a slippery wander in the way they roll.  In the snow they are slippery as well on the hard pack material.  In the loose deep snow they are MONSTERS.  Just pointed the Ranger 900 Crew into the field with the plow down and away I went.  Pulled really well in the deep snow, just kept going and going.  Im sure I can get stuck somewhere but not where I was. Snow was 1/5 feet deep.

I bought two that are working great. Then I bought two more. One is working, one broke in half. I would like JDM to replace it without making me send in the broken one for analysis. Additionally the base is a little to thin to make good contact.My original review for the first two is below.These things are bright. Twice or three times as bright as the stock incandescent bulbs. They are as bright or brighter than my 55 watt auxiliary back up lights. I'm very happy.

The bumpers are metal so I left the old ones on only using the handle.The bolt to the handle don't line up so you have to drill.

Fit perfectly.  Only thing I had to do was trim 3 sections of the rubber flange on the inside of the hood so I could get better access to the 3 holes already on the hood.

Lines up with the rear frame bolt holes just fine, and for the $10 saved over the name brand version seems worth it so far.  My only gripe is that it's black, and not green I guess.  But that is easy to rectify with some sandpaper, a can of paint and some time.  The holes in mine were oval as they're supposed to be, and lined up perfectly with the mounting holes on the back of my Gator TS.  My hitch slid right in, and the pin fit perfectly to hold it all together.  I can't really find a true complaint yet, but I haven't towed anything with it either, so I'll reserve that 5th star for once I do that.

This fan is much larger than the OEM Polaris #4170009 fan this fan claims to replace. It will not fit the factory bracket without modification. The motor itself appears to be decently built and has quite a bit of torque. The wiring is the correct length, gauge, and color, and is terminated to match the OEM fan which is nice. There is no vent/breather for this fan as there was on the OEM fan, which could be both good and/or bad depending on the situation. It's a shame that this motor doesn't fit, as it seems there are no other aftermarket options available...

The running boards are very simple to install and only need a 1/2 socket. The hardest part was the factory spary onto the bolt on the body from Ford made it a little hard to turn the wrench.The width is perfect and easy to get in and out.These were a great addition to the truck and I am very satisfied.

Look cool on the bike. The downside is that the threaded inserts you use to install them will jump a thread if you tighten the bolts that hold the mirrors on too tight. Also, one of them came with a bad bulb.

I painted my Ranger's valve cover with this.  I did about 4-5 light coats prior then about 2 medium coats.  I used the entire can.  I then baked in the oven after 3 hours for 200 degrees for about 1.5hrs.  Directions state 200 degrees for 1 hour.The only thing I do NOT like is they don't specifically tell you the clear coat procedure.  They recommend their clearcoat but give no directions on should it be applied right after the base coat or do you apply it after the base coat is dry, or do you bake the basecoat then add clear.....etc.  I find that annoying and knocked off a star.  See before picture and after.EDIT:  I will note that a lot of people complain that this is not durable.  It has to be baked.  I will say that before baking I tested a piece and was able to scratch it with my finger nail after a few days of it being dry.  I then baked that same piece in the oven at 200 degrees and after it finally cooled I attempted to scratch it again and it did not scratch.  I believe it's the ceramic that is in the paint that has to set which is why they want you to bake it.

I needed a spare tire for my BigTex 30SA Trailer.  I used the the measure chart pictured to find out I needed a 5X5 bolt circle.  I then double checked the info on another web site and looked up the info in the trailer hand book (the way they give to measure is perfect and probably the easiest way to measure).  The tire came in about 8-9 days after ordering (which was fine), in a cardboard box.  As for how fresh the tire was, I ordered the tire the 48th week of 2016, and the tire was produced the 25th week (less than 6 months old...which I feel is outstanding).  Having this tire shipped was still about 30% less than if I would have bought it locally.  I would buy again and would recommend it.

I've tried other brands and have not been impressed with the lifespan.  I've been using these for various cars for years now and I'm very pleased.As for real world lifespan... 1st of the pack of 2 failed this week, so it lasted 16months (i usually get about 24 months)... *the bulbs are H7 in a Volvo that turns the headlights on whenever the key is on.as always, ymmv

Look good came clean, not fractured, defiantly recommend LED bulbs for break and turn signal, my reverse looks way brighter but if i am going to do LED bulbs i might as well do them all.

Perfectly fits a 2005 Nissan Titan/Armada, I would not buy a smaller belt.--QualityI have purchased this belt for a separate vehicle, which has been in use now for roughly 50k miles. The belt is still in fantastic shape. I do not doubt it will hold up just as well on the Nissan Titan--Install- I would highly recommend using a ratcheting torque wrench or something you can get leverage on for this install.- Place the 14mm socket over the bolt on the belt tensioner. You should be using some kind of cheater bar to get leverage on this.- Pull to your left, towards the passenger side of the vehicle. Have an allen wrench ready. Look at the tensioner, it has 2 holes that will align allowing you to 'lock' the tensioner into place to pull off the old belt and install the new.- Once you have the tensioner locked pull the old belt off.- Install your new belt. To ensure proper alignment of the new belt I'd recommend you pull off the skid plate (4 10mm bolts)on the bottom of the vehicle. This should make the install easier around those pulleys.- Make sure the belt is fit onto all pulleys properly, again pull your wrench towards the passenger side to give you enough space to remove the allen wrench from the tensioner assembly.- Reinstall skid plate if you had removed it, 4 10mm bolts.--Final ThoughtsAmazon actually recommends some smaller fit belts for the Titan. I can imagine that these belts would fit even tighter than this one, possibly causing issues. This is a safe replacement for the OEM belt which is supposed to be replaced at your 90k maintenance interval.

First off I drive an 05 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I bought one of these sensors last year, changed it myself,  and it worked great. A few weeks ago I bought 2 more, changed them myself, and they don't work. One kicks on every now and then but doesn't stay on long. The other doesn't work at all. I've tried switching the tires around it didn't help.

This is my inital review.  I bought this to give us some extra room because with bulky baby gear you run out of room quick!  I just installed my hitch receiver by CURT and added this cargo carrier for an up coming road trip.  The quality looks good.  The whole thing is pretty solid.  I walked on top of it after it was installed and it felt sturdy enough.  Assembly was quick but as another review mentioned you will want to get some washers for the 4 larger bolts.I also purchased the ROLA LED light kit and the fit is not 100%.  I would have expected the lights to lock in place but the lights can pop out if something pressed up against them.  Also I wish they would have made a tube or a chanel to run the wiring through. I thought that buying the same ROLA brand would have made it cleaner.  The wires are a decent guage, not weak or flimsy so that's a plus.I have not hauled any gear yet so I can't give it a full review but I will soon and I will update my review.Update: After our roadtrip am very happy with this carrier.  I carried tools with me incase of any emergency but there were no issues at all.  We had the entire car full and without this we wouldn't have been able to carry all of our stuff.  I bought a big plastic storage bin from Wal-Mart and cut holes for the ratcheting straps to fit through.  Then I slapped on a reflective sticker for added visibility and safety.  This kept the gear clean and dry because it rain for most of our trip.

Overall I am satisfied with these. The only issues I ran into is that I had to use the original mounting hardware from the originals due to slight differences in design. all three black retainers on the new unit were shorter and slightly thicker than the OEM so they were difficult to insert but once inserted they did not go in deep enough to catch and hold in place. Also the light adjustment stud design is slightly different at the base which I just unscrewed and replace with the one form the lights I was replacing. The vehicle was a 07 Tahoe I was working on.

Great product - although only 8.5 oz - so order the number of can accordinglyMy situation - 2001 GMC Yukon XL - body side molding - stupid silly money to replace with original - so why not spend 8 bucks!!They say the proof is in the performance - so I'll attach some pictures -  but it's simple prep, prep, prep - for me I used the blue painters tape to tape off the "chrome" inserts - then made 3-4 passes to ensure no runs or dripsHopefully I will not have to, but I'll order this again if necessry
