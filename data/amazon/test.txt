The lights themselves are very bright, with a good, narrow pencil beam.  Two concerns: the power lead comes out of the lamp on the side, so when you mount the lights, one cable will be coming out toward the inside, and the other towards the outside.  It works ok, just looks a little strange.  The other problem I had with them is the included mounting bracket is very weak.  I had one fatigue and break from the vibration of my motorcycle after just 1500 miles.  The light is just fine, but I'll have to fabricate a new mount.  The other light's mount has started to crack in the same place.EDIT 4-7-17:  The mounting bracket for the remaining light has broken in the same manner as the first.  I bought another light just for the bracket, but I expect it will fail the same way soon.

This was an exact replacement for the spark plug on my Honda HRS2164PDA with the GCV160 engine.  The engine came with a BPR5ES and I replaced it with this BPR6ES.  It didn't make a difference.  The engine still goes pop pop pop like it should.

Amazon said this does not fit my 2006 RoadGlide. Well, it does. Not shown in the picture, is that it has a beautiful brass lining and grease fitting. Plenty of space between the side of the ISO floorboard and pedal. Looks very, very nice! Excellent chrome. Kuryakyn does an excellent job with installation directions and necessary pics.

My new car was attacked by a poorly hung metal realtor's sign that blew off on a very windy day last fall.  This resulted in a deep gouge in my bumper and several smaller scuffs, scratches and areas of paint transfer.  Naturally the realtor refused to pay for the repair and called it an act of God.  I'm almost certain God would have hung the sign properly so that it didn't blow away but I digress.I tried unsuccessfully to buff out the smaller scratches and paint transfer with a spray detailer and microfiber towel which did very little other than to create brand new rub marks (I was desperate, clueless and frenzied, bad combo).  My car also had a couple of minor rub marks that were present when I bought it new.This product was my last and most successful attempt at removing most of the damage.  I spot cleaned the areas first with a waterless car wash then went to town with my $17 hand polisher and within a few minutes, the small scratches, scuffs and paint transfer were gone.  Deeper scratches were greatly reduced but not totally eliminated. I'm fine with that as they're not visible unless you really inspect closely.  I didn't bother using it on the gouge as that's not what it's meant for.  This works for small, superficial scuffs and scratches only and will not work for anything that has gone past the clear coat.My driver side door sill was also covered with fine scratches which bugged me every time I saw them.  I first tried buffing these out by hand, which removed most of the scratches, but I used a microfiber covered wax applicator which left rub marks.  Be sure to only use this product with a FOAM applicator, whether you're using a polisher or doing it by hand.  Microfiber is not really meant to be used for really hard rubbing on paint, which this product requires.  I went over the area again with a foam applicator which removed the rub marks.Overall I'm extremely happy with the results.  This product removed most of the original damage in addition to the damage I caused myself in my previous attempts.Unfortunately I could only include a couple of pictures as it's nearly impossible to take a decent close up picture of black paint unless the lighting is just right. The first picture shows the fine scratches on my door sill which I buffed out by hand using a wax applicator pad. The second is one of the areas of paint transfer and scuffs created by the kamikaze realtor's sign... these were removed using this product and cheap hand polisher.

I expected this part number to fit a 2.25" diameter pipe but this fits a 2.5" pipe as others have stated in separate reviews.  I used this on a 2000 Ford Ranger 3.0L to mate the muffler extension to the catalytic when the ears on the cat rusted away.  It held tightly against the remains of the old flange once I flipped it backwards despite being a little big.  The springs are now a bit tight as the bolts span a longer distance.  The clamp and hardware seem as well made as most light-duty aftermarket exhaust parts.  I expect I will get a couple of years out.

Arrived promptly, but bottle had leaked.I contacted Amazon, and a replacement has arrived, intact. Good customer service.The product seems to work very well, though 2 ounces does not go far. It is a particularly noxious smelling, and probably significantly toxic solvent, and gloves are supplied. These gloves are very flimsy and soon tore. So I'd recommend buying more chemical resistant gloves and double layering. Eye protection and an activated carbon mask for solvents would be a good idea. Any paint store should sell suitable safety masks and gloves. Or a hardware store.I would give more stars based on performance, but the noxious nature and small bottle size mean I'm on the fence about it.Picture shows faded shutters on upper windows, and treated shutters on lower. Doing these shutters (now uppers are also done)... took 4 packs.i

Quality seems to be excellent.I can't tell if this stainless is high enough quality that rust won't form, but my use of this center cap is for  a vehicle that sees zero rain or water.Like another commenter stated, if the cap fits a little loose when installed, tweak the hidden inner edge slightly with a needle nose plier in three or so spots to keep from rattling when installed.

The Leather Conditioner was VERY easy to apply and it has a very nice smell as well. I have never had nice leather items before and it was recommended by the seller of the furniture to buy some leather conditioner to use twice a year so this was my first experience with leather conditioner. I was afraid it would smell with a chemical smell but it smells very nice and I would definitely recommend it to anyone because it was also very easy to apply.

My oldest was moving to a state which required a license plate in the front. This fit the 2010 Elantra very nicely. The car had a flat spot for a front license plate and also indentations on each side of the area in the front of the car for mounting screws. I used the existing screws & washer that came with the plate and while I was at it, added another pair of screws/washer just below it figuring that 4 attachment points were better than two.If your vehicle doesn't have a flat spot for a license plate but has at least the two dimples (indentations) then you might be able to use this license plate bracket. Personally, I prefer to have 4 attachment points which I was able to do since there was plenty of space on the flat raised area on the front of the car. The 2nd pair of holes were not a part of the indentations on the front of the Elantra, however it fit nicely.

The mufflers are a five star. Well made.  However, I used them on a 1978 Honda  CM185 and  the provided reducers did not clamp down on the header pipes. The slots in the reducers appeared to be to narrow. I was not happy at all!  I ended up going to Auto Zone and buying a reducer that would slip into the tail pipe and another one that would fit into the previously mentioned reducer. Then I inserted the smallest reducer into them, Took that contraption to a local muffler shop to be welded. Now the mufflers can slip on and be clamped. What a Pain in the @$$. The sound is awsome on this little bike. Nice deep throaty sound.

My experience with bicycle racks comes from have been owner of an Allen foldable, now with the SR2 from Hollywood is a big big upgrade, well made, heavy and sturdy. In the beginning, once out of the box it seems a bit confused and chaotic, but once you've all the items displayed and identified, it takes only a few minutes to assemble. NOTE for the Jeep Liberty owners; the cap of the rims has three hex screws behind, so don't use your flat screwdriver to pull it out (like me), my spare tire is the same from stock and I've used the second adapter (counting from the smaller to the bigger), once installed it feels firm... really firm.I love the low profile and the fact that the arms are from one swivel piece, they have no articulated joints. the tip is secured with a screw, there is no possibility that it accidentally slips and falls, besides, the cradle can be tight with the allen key in the kit, another security factor more.It holds my mountain bike pretty well, although it could be better to use a frame adapter, the down side of the lower arm from the frame is flat and wide, so it don't fit inside the cradle,(this is in any rack), even with this "issue" I took it to pick up the new mountain bike of my GF to the shop, and It did the job amazingly, at 40 even 60 mph with no swinging, even in irregular streets the bike remained very stable.

Got this on the off chance it would work on a 1997 Ford E450 Super Duty.  I only needed to use the worm gear but it solved the issue of no odometer working but the speedo still did.  This vehicle has a mechanical odometer and the worm gear basically turned to mush. The removal of the speedo cluster was no simple matter but the worm gear did fit with no issues.

These work great on a Yamaha warrior at. They do require some slight modification though. I drilled a hold through my headlight bracket and used the supplied U bracket with a bolt to lock them down as the headlight is too wide to fit in the stock bracket. Very bright, waiting on durability but so far they seem quality!

I purchased this winch mount for my 2014 Ford F150 Raptor and it fits like a champ. The install is super easy; it shouldn't take you more than 45 minutes to an hour. Some of the mounting parts that come with it aren't required if you are mounting it to a Raptor, but are needed if installed on any other model. The build quality of this mount seems to be pretty good, and there was very minor spacing issues while installing, I've certainly seen worse from large aftermarket companies like ARB, TJM and certainly Smittybilt. One of the things I really appreciated about the winch plate was the forethought to add in mounting points for the dust/dirt shield.I have no doubts that this will hold up to the abuse that gets thrown at it, however I'll update my review accordingly if anything changes.

I'm on my 3rd bike and this is the first time I've purchased a stand.  I never wanted to spend the kind of money most are sold for.  This one got me to change my mind.  The reviews don't lie.  This thing is very, very nice for the money.  Sturdy, easy to adjust, fantastic wheels.  It showed up quick, went together fast, and even looks really nice.Since it's my first stand, I can't compare it to anything else, but I can't imagine spending 2-3x more for the same end result.I use spools to lift it and the bike sits rock solid.  In addition to making chain/wheel cleaning easier, sprocket swaps faster, and chain adjustments more precise, I love being able to hold the bike straight while I store and run it during winter.It would have been nice to purchase an American made product, but, it is what it is.A+++  THANKS PIT POSSE!!!

I tested this analog gauge against another Amazon gauge, (Vepagoo Pro) and a digital gauge. The TireTek was off by 1lb, where as the Vepagoo was off by 3lbs.I've used this gauge lightly as of purchasing. It's been great for off-roading trips. It helps me release the air from my tires before I hit the trails and makes the airing up process easy.Solid quality, easy to read, good value.

I noticed there was a small piece that the paint was chipped off but not a big deal. I wanted to paint it with a different color anyways so I fixed it and it only took a few minutes. They fit my 2015 jk wrangler just fine. The wire from the light bar made it difficult to install the bolts back on the jeep so I ended up taking the padding off. Other than that they are very stable and sturdy. It holds the light bar just fine. I recommend this product. Very easy to install.

Only had them on a couple days now, but these seem great.  Box came a little beat up, but no damage to the boards. The instruction layout is extremely jumbled around, but once I figured out what parts to skip around to; it was a breeze. Once I had the first bracket on, I threw aside the instructions & finished the rest.  Everything came labeled left & right side.  However, they mislabeled the board sides, which didn't take long to figure out.  It seems like they will only fit if you do it correctly. Make sure not to tighten the bolts until everything is lined up & level.  Took maybe 1.5 hrs to complete, since my Ram is already pre-drilled for boards.  I was quoted about $600 at the Dodge dealership when I picked up the truck. For less than $200 & 2hrs of work, I am very happy.

The connector is a quality connector and would otherwise be worthy of 5 stars.  However, it is totally unnecessary had Noco simply used more cost effective standard connectors compatible with other devices on the market place such as common ring terminal adapters and SAE extension cords.  As it is this part played a critical roll of allowing my G3500 to connect to the system.The charging solution I am using this with includes two different charging sources, a Suaoki 60Watt solar and a Noco Genius G3500 Smart Charger.  Both are great and provide a similar amount of power to the batteries.  The solar charger does not work so well at night though, and the wall charger does not work when out camping on the boat.Suaoki 60Watt Solarhttp://amzn.to/2w1ylpKNoco Genius G3500http://amzn.to/2gan697Using the Suaoki solar charger requires the using of a solar charge controller for safety.  The Suaoki can be directly connected to the battery, but then the voltage must be monitored as it can overcharge your batteries and lead to premature failure or worse.  I am using the Instapark PWM charge controller for this task and it is a perfect match to the system.http://amzn.to/2xg7pAWThe NOCO Genius uses properietary connectors and while it comes with a few different options, none of them made it compatible with my requirements.  I ordered the NOCO to SAE adapter and now it connects to a standard SAE plug and works well, interchangably with the Solar charger.http://amzn.to/2wrOxl0In order to add flexibility in placing the solar panel or connecting the NOCO charger, I added an SAE extension.  Essentially this is a 12V extension cord.  Any SAE to SAE cable will work provided it has sufficient gauge(AWG). For a 15ft length this should be at least 12AWG with 10AWG or even 8AWG being better.  For a 5ft length 16AWG or 14AWG will be acceptable, of course 12,10 or 8 still better.  Anything smaller less than those maxiums will degrade the charging capacity as it will cause an significant voltage drop.  Here are a couple alternatives that look good.Kuncan 12ft SAE to SAEhttp://amzn.to/2iuIzduTetra-Teknica MotoBasic 10AWG 3 Feet, 2 per Packhttp://amzn.to/2g7VT6SI used two ring terminal to SAE adapters, one for each battery, as the aligator clamps were problematic and not particularly reliable.  The aligator clamps meant that I had to climb into the compartment where the batteries are stored in the boat and almost always insured a good bump on the head.  Sometimes I would come back the next morning to find one had fallen off.  Using ring terminals insures a secure connection to the battery and allows me to quickly connect/disconnect without bumping my head.  I used the Tetra-Teknica MotoBasics 16 gauge 2 feet 10A fused 2 pack for my solution.http://amzn.to/2w89HlTIn order to charge the two batteries in parallel, I needed to add an SAE Y adapter.  The OptiMate Y-splitter worked nicely.  I disconnect it when not charging as I do not want power accidentally pulled accross this connection if the boat is using a single battery.  I am looking for a solution, a diode that will allow me to keep this connected permanently without that risk.http://amzn.to/2w1wjG0The system is working well and keeping my batteries topped off between outings without a problem.

Great set of lights for the price. I bought my original set of these driving lights from Walmart. They had recently sold out, and Amazon was the first place I came to find another set. I purchased a light bar for the hood of my truck for Christmas, and went to these lights to fill the bar. I now have three sets of the Hella 500FF lamps on my truck, and I couldn't be happier. I have gotten many compliments on how well the lights look on the roof, as well as how bright the lights are when turned on. I would recommend to everyone buying a set of Hella's lights because the price can't be beat.

I purchased two of these for my 2003 Dodge Caravan. The original remotes were still operating fine, but were starting to look pretty worn and the batteries were probably nearing the end of their useful life. Note: You must have a working remote to be able to program additional or replacement remotes.PROS+ Replacement remotes are identical in button layout, size and shape to the originals+ Easy to program if you can follow instructions+ Originals & replacements utilize CR2016 batteries (batteries are stacked in pairs for each remote)+ Identical functionality once programmedNEUTRAL/OBSERVATIONS (does not affect rating)+/- Replacement remotes have a matte finish (originals have smooth, glossy finish)+/- Replacement remotes are more difficult to open+/- I noticed no difference in the working distance of the replacement remotes+/- Internals of replacement and original remotes look practically identical except for the numbering on some of the circuitryCONS- Tabs that secure the stacked batteries are in a different position and broken off so when you replace the batteries or open up the remote, you have to make sure they are stacked perfectly before mating the two halves of the remotes (see photo)- Buttons on replacement remotes do not offer the same satisfying feel (click) when pressed as the originals

I really like this wrench extender, as it doesn't use the open-end part of the wrench to gain leverage like other methods and other units.  However, the quality of the finish is absolutely horrendous.  Am not sure if I got a badly finished product, or if all of them are like that.  I will upload photos for you to see the finish that I am talking about.  I am unsure if they are cutting corners, or if the metal is made out of crappy alloy.  As I use this tool, I will update my review.I also included photos of the Maxx-Leverage units I purchased as well.One advantage of this Wrench Extender is that there is a square-drive hole on the end to use a 1/2" ratchet/breaker bar to extend the leverage.  However, not sure I would recommend adding another lever bar onto this unit, you may end up breaking wrenches and/or bolts/nuts.

As many others have now reviewed, these things break SO easily. After mind broke, I tried flexing one of the intact halves. It's about an inch thick to rubber, which should be indestructible... I easily stressed it enough to form a crack, and then it propagated as if the material were brittle. I'd rather rig something up myself than buy a new one.

So I received this product today and Installed it. First What I received was not what is Pictured though it is close... What I received was a Flat rectangle with the Molly webbing and then the two bags. There was no cut out for the door hinge or cable and handle area. I will try and add pix later. It did only take me 20 min to install I used a power drill a screw driver and some elbow grease. Attached the bags and done. If you have the ability to hang a picture in your home you can install this. As for not having the cut out for the door hinge I just undid the hinge installed the gear then poked 2 holes where the hinge screws go through and re attached the hinge through the gear. Bam looks great works great .. Adapt Over come Improvise.. That's what having a Jeep is about.

After much searching, I chose these battery terminals for a dual-battery install on my vehicle. The so-called military style terminals have longer connection posts (bolts) to facilitate adding connection points for accessory loads, fuses, etc. Although these terminals looked nice in the pictures, they have one exceptional flaw that makes them very frustrating to work with.At some point in the long-ago past, some brilliant engineers created a fastener connection that incorporated a square-head bolt that was held snugly by a flat surface that was milled or cast next to the bolt-hole directly adjacent to one edge of the head. This amazing technological advance made it possible for a mechanic to tighten the nut on the other end of the bolt without having to secure the bolt's head with a wrench. This would be very useful in, say, an engine bay where one might have limited space and multiple connections. The Noco TZKIT3 Lead-Free Military Grade Zinc Battery Terminal Kit does indeed have a square-head bolt and the flat surface near the bolt-hole. The problem is that the bolt's head is too small for the bolt to catch on the flat surface - it just turns round and round. And if you go up one bolt size, it won't fit in the hole. Or maybe the cast is defective, placing the flat in the wrong place. Take your pick. Either way, you can't tighten the terminal to the battery without finding a way to hold that square head, which is made more difficult by the flat surface that now makes it difficult to hold the the head with any kind of wrench, especially if you wanted to put a lug under the head. I didn't have the time or patience to return these defective terminals, so I made-do by filing a recess into the terminal so I could use stainless carriage bolts to hold the head fast to the terminal, which works well but precludes the placement of any connection under the head.You might think I'm a little ridiculous to expend so much effort and expense improving a product that should have been made correctly in the first place. And one might think me cranky for sharing my frustration in such detail. But this has really been an issue for me as the years go by. Do we, as consumers, just tolerate lower and lower standards of quality? As battery terminals go, these were more expensive than most. I thought I was buying quality. Amazon has a famously wonderful return policy and I'm sure I could have returned these for a full refund. I just didn't have the time.Unfortunately, modern manufacturing now dictates that little or no care need be applied to the actual design intention of those genius engineers so long ago. The bean-counters have figured out that only a few purchasers will ever bother to return the product, making it profitable not to expend unnecessary effort creating something of real quality. And eventually, no one will know the difference.

I used Dupli-Color BTY1602 to paint the door handle assemblies on my 2003 Toyota Tacoma (Lunar mist 1C8).  The clear coat had gone bad on the original paint on the handles.  The can I got also said Silver Met. instead of Lunar Mist and it did look a little more silver when going on.  Once I got the clear coat on (I used the USC Spray Max 2k High Gloss Clearcoat Aerosol sold on Amazon) and removed the painters tape, I was very happy with the color match.  Is it perfect?...... not quite (depends on the lighting), but darn close considering it came from a rattle can and went on a vehicle with 13 year old paint.  I think it helped that the door handles aren't a big flat panel next to another flat panel of stock paint.  Overall I am very happy with this paint.

(Installed on a first gen 300zx)Fit PERFECT, no modifications necessary.  These fit over the Shock shaft "collar", you just have to push them down hard.  First pic.They fit the length of the shock too.  Once installed, the weight of the vehicle will compress the shock so there's no gap.  Second pic.It's a bellow and a bump stop for one price.  Third Pic.

I have a 2012 Tacoma DCLB and I wanted a tool box for the extra security for carrying firearms to my ranch.  This process of ordering this box was not very fun but UWS makes an excellent product!  The first box I ordered did not have the angled side and did not fit in the bed of my truck.  I exchanged it for this one and to my surprise when I opened it, it had a very large dent on it.... I had to exchange it again for another one and finally the third one was good...  I highly recommend getting 2 additional U Bolts to install this.  It comes with 2 and it will move around if you only use these 2 but keep in mind if you do 4 it voids the warranty.Pro:- Very well built- Bigger than I expected- Sleek and very attractive lookingCons:-Shipping takes an additional 3-7 days-Product discription is piss poor-Original product didn't fit.Overall, this is a very good box but dealing with shipping was a pain in the *ss.

I was waiting and so happy to have them installed on my 2006 Altima. And when I was changing them, I noticed they didn't fit. The old one is a H11 and this one I bought isn't a h11. I want a refund or for them to send me the CORRECT light bulb size... thank you..

not only do they look really great I truly feel they work better. breaking them in went perfect. I have just turned 40k on my '14 jk and it was time for brakes. found a seized up pin on passenger rear that I didn't know was there so I am glad I did. the linearity of the brakes is perfect. haven't tried pushing them so hard as to activate the antilock but they stop on a dime. couldn't be happier and can't believe you can get these for such a low price.

This is a review for the JK roof mounts for 50 inch light bars. One of the bars had too much of an angle at the top so that when the light bar was mounted it didn't have full contact. I contacted rough country they said that I can return it and I'm going to purchase another set to see if that's any better.in the pics you can see the left side doesn't have a flat contact with the light bar but the right side(drivers) does...

Fit these on my 2006 Durango 4x4 in 2014.  Ride is firm and compliant - for the first 10k miles.I'm on my 3rd set in 3 years (about 30k miles). Thank goodness for free warranty replacement.The rear Reflex 911260 set is holding up fine after 30k.The attached pic shows my front shocks with less than 15k miles on them. As you can see, one shock is completely collapsed. Same deal 15k prior to that - one was completely shot.

Be warned! The hardware that comes in these kits is incomplete!  In the photos you will find a square metal unit with three tension screws in it.. this unit requires a small *U-shaped bracket that fits inside the groove.. this is what clamps onto whatever you're moving back and forth (in my case, a door handle cable). I had to fabricate my own metal pinch clip/clamp to use this actuator. Don't expect a simple install WITHOUT this piece.*See attached photo of the U-shaped pinch clamp that I'm referring to. This kit does NOT included this required part!

Initially it looked good, but things kept going wrong until I put it back in the box and said go away before I taunt you a second time!  The ice cooler tub had a crack in it.. so clearly that was not going to work.  I said that's ok I won't use it anyway.  Then I went to bolt the mount into the Jeep.  One of the mounting holes was missing.  One side had two holes and this one had one and a 1/2, but when mounting things 1/2 a hole doesnt count in my opinion.  So strike two yet I still pressed on with the install as it was secure enough with two bolts.  The instructions said to screw up from the mount into the console.  Well the bolts are so long (and yes i checked there are are no shorter ones) they stuck up into the console.  Nice game of will I get my fingers poked each time I reach into the console.  NO thanks!  I screwed them in from the inside down into the mount to fix that.  Then I went to secure the front of the console. The front bolt was not long enough to go through the bottom and into the Jeep.  I went to move and put a little weight on the front of the console and it just collapsed and broke under moderate pressure.  I said nope, back in the box you go, you piece of junk.  I may try another one or I may just hold drinks in my lap like my grandpa used to.This was cheaply made and I would not recommend to anyone, even those people I don't really like that much.

They come in a clamshell, so be careful when opening.  I wish they were a little more substantial (thicker plastic) for better protection  I bought these to use with the 500 lights, so i would not have to leave the full coverage covers on all the time.The 3 clamps they have molded into them hold excellent. They are positioned in the same 3 spots as the solid covers.  Taking them off seem to be easiest from the bottom where a tab is located on each side of the stem.  There is less torque applied using this method, then trying to unsnap the top tab first.  Put them 'on' with the top tab positioned first. Then use both hands to snap the bottom tabs into place,  This minimizes any torque applied to the plastic housing.  I think this is where some reviewers complained about cracking the plastic housing.

As you can see in the attached image, my roll didn't arrive in the best condition. Both ends have damage, but this is the worst. The damage reduces the total usable area of the roll.As for the vinyl itself, it is thinner than I had hoped for. There is a texture to the surface. Whether this is good depends on your application. It works ok for my application, but probably not for many of the things people are buying it for.

These lights look awesome. I have an 04 grand cherokee limited. Passenger side fit perfectly. .. the drivers side was a pain and i had to do some "fixing" to put in. I think from the manufacturing the plastic wasn't molded right. I had to use longer screws and put a couple washers between the light and bolt so the bottom of the light would be flush with the body. If i used the oem screws it sat a good 1/4 inch inside the hole for the light. Looked so stupid! It Still isn't perfect but I'll keep them. Definitely not worth $ for the dinkin around i had to do. They do look awesome though!

Installed on 2015 Ram 2500 well built, easy to install. Yes the welds are a little sloppy as another reviewer had mentioned, but they are inside the tray no one will ever see them unless they stand over the winch tray. I ended up using the factory bolts from tow hooks to mount the tray brackets, the ones that came with the kit were a little short. Still 5 stars because it's a great value and heavy duty. I bought winch tray, bull bar, 2 tow hooks, and license plate holder, all for $500 including free 2 day delivery with Prime membership. Plan on installing a Smittybilt X20 Comp 12K winch that I will be receiving for Christmas. I will follow up on the review after it is installed.

I am always skeptical about someone's description of a product they're selling, mostly due to it being their selling point. But when I put these lights in, I was blown away. They really are super bright. As far as the longevity, that remains to be seen. If I have any issues with them, I will update, but as of now, I'm very happy.

Wow.  This is really an amazing product, the best you will find anywhere online for the price.First off the shipping was supposed to take about a week but it came in only 3 days!  The parts and motor were packaged efficiently and properly to prevent any damages.  The quality of this motor is superior to all others that i searched for, the paint job was done correctly, the motor was molded correctly, and the majority of the screws were great quality (only the gear cover screws were a easy to strip). But more importantly was the best customer support that I have ever received.  When I got the package, I saw the fuel filter was broken, so I bought a new one and the seller refunded me the amount with no questions.  When i first rode the bike the chain snapped in half (I put it on wrong) and the seller even refunded me for the new one I purchased!  You will not find any other seller selling a motor for that price with that good support.I paired up this motor with  A TREK 820 mountain bike and it fit perfecly- I was able to get 29 mph on flat ground (i am 200lb) whic is amazing.TIP:  use bikeberry's you tube video for how to install this.BREAK IN; YOU DO NOT NEED TO STAY UNDER 15MPH FOR THE FIRST 3 TANKS.  To properly break this in you should use the 16:1 ratio to make sure everything is lubricated in the motor.  When you ride, warm up the bike and then first run in 1/3 throttle for about 10 seconds, then coast.  After, go up to 2/3 throttle for 10 secons and let the bike coast.  Again, go to full throttle and then then let thte bike coast.  By doing this warm up, you allow the engine to set in all rpm ranges, not just the 15mph range.  Otherwhise enjoy this bike, I have put on 70 miles already without a problem.

My 7x14 tandem axle trailer was stolen in LESS than 4 minutes according to my neighbor's surveillance footage.  I had a good coupler lock, padlock and The Club 491 Tire Claw bought in May 2010.  It held up nice through all the weather for 5 years, but when the two thieves showed up while we were on vacation, it did not stop the thieves.  Video showed they used an angle grinder to partial cut all three locks with just a 1/4" cut, then they used a pry bar to pop off the coupler lock, and the pad lock on the coupler latch. They didn't even try to pry the Tire Claw off. They just took off with the tire claw still on the rim with two partial cuts that took less than 10 second to cut.  Three days later, we recovered the remains of my trailer.  Somewhere along the line, the claw just fell off. I'll give the product its due.  By the looks of the rim, The Club stayed on for a while.  But it did not stop the theft.  Police say this is typical.  Thieves don't care about the damage it does, they just want whats in side for quick cash. If they have the time, they will cut the trailer up and sell it to the metal recyclers.A word to the wise, if the trailer is stolen on your driveway, content insurance goes to the home or rental insurance. If you do not formally notify your insurance company of the specific value inside the trailer, all you will get is a $200 check.  Also, if you use this product, be sure to by McGard Lugnut Locks on the rim. Police says more than 50% of the people who use products like the club forget to lock the rim down. On a tandem axle trailer, they just remove the tire with the club on it.  On single axle tires, they often have a spare and slap it on and go, so use McGard Lugnut Locks on that tire the claw is on.I have gone now with a Abus 10KS Chain 10' that feeds through the tire rim and wraps around the axle padlocked to a Abloy PL362 Grade 6 Padlock, a AMPLock Coupler Lock, and a Abloy PL 330 for that hitch latch.  I will be getting a Trailer GPS Tracker too for $25/mo that connects to my smart phone and the GPS feed can be forwarded to the Police and Police cruisers.

Extremely bright! See images below of low beams only and then low beams with this light. Case appears to be well made, but like everybody else mine wasn't totally sealed and began to develop condensation. Do yourself a favor, When it comes in the mail completely disassemble it and seal everything up with Black RTV Silicon. It does cause FM Radio interference. Most likely due to poor RFI shielding on the LED Driver circuitry. If you live in a metropolitan area close to your radio stations you probably won't notice, but then again if you live in a metropolitan area you probably don't need a light capable of illuminating half the county.

Seems to be OEM quality and fit. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because part of it must be modified to fit properly. I have included a photo showing both the original, and the Dorman replacement. The mounting point on the original is flat, and the Dorman is made at a 45 angle. With it at this angle, it is impossible to mount it properly as the tab will keep the battery tray form fitting back down where it belongs. I had to spend a couple of minutes heating the tab with a heat gun, and then carefully bent it down flat. It then fit perfectly in place. Also be warned, the opening for the low coolant sensor is VERY tight. I had to smear the grommet with dish washing liquid to get it to even go partway in. Be patient and just work it back and forth and it should go in far enough to work properly.

These lights look great on my truck, but did have some problems. The order of the lights is different than stock, so I needed to cut the ties holding the stock wiring in place to get enough slack to attach them. The tabs that the screws go in to hold these on was absolute garbage and the lights would fall off, so I made new aluminum tabs to go over them that the screw attaches to. There is a signifactly larger gap between the light assembly and body of the truck, which allowed a small tree branch to get caught in when I backed into a spot, which broke off the top corner of the plastic cover.

I love my 2012 Honda Fit, but I didn't like the fact that when load groceries or anything else, the contents are all over the place. This cargo organizer is super functional and made from good solid materials.Breakdown\Pros>-Made or good solid materials for a long lasting experience-Can be anchored into place (Honda fit has two anchor points in the back where it secures easily) so you don't have to be worrying about moving objects recently purchased and loaded on your vehicle.-Comes with dividers which helps separate and organize your goods nicely inside (the dividers fold away if you don't need them giving full spread of the organizer forlarger items.-Folds up with ease for quick simple storage anywhere in your vehicle (I keep it where the spare tire is at).Cons>-None really found so far. I just wish maybe it a pinch bigger.Conclusion/This product is probably one the most useful things I've bought for my car. You will not regret your purchase. Your groceries will thank you :)Hope this was helpful!

Follow instructions. Read reviews. Watch videos..  Take your time, and do it on a hot, sunny day..  First time you take the back window out to put groceries in.. You will feel like, 'eh.. this is easy!!'  ... go to put the window back.. not so much.. unhook front latches.. anything you can to loosen it up. It WILL work.. don't stress.. and don't force it.. Ripping the seams would be a bad thing.  The sunrider top is AWESOME!  I drive 20 minutes to/ from work.. sometimes taking the entire top off (on my old soft top) was more of a chore than it was worth..This makes getting some sun a breeze! Love it. Highly recommend.. and 4WD is one of the top notch companies out there.. Their customer service is phenomenal..

The blue 3 digit voltmeter is working fine. But after a week, the plastic adhesive front face sticker has deformed and is peeling off. I've contacted DROK requesting replacement plastic stickers as installation took me an hour and I'd rather not have to replace the entire voltmeter.I don't know why it deformed. It could be the high humidity. I requested several replacement stickers in case this happens again.Other than this issue, the Voltmeter works really nice and looks good. As a note to others, if you use a switched positive relay, you will see an approximate  - 0.25 - 0.3V difference in the reading compared to connecting the Voltmeter directly to Battery + -, in which case you would have to install an inline switch so as not to have a parasitic drain on your battery. I have confirmed the above voltage difference with a handheld voltmeter. I'll probably just leave my install the way it currently is and just add +.3V to the reading to get an accurate voltage reading.

Upper control arms seem to be of high quality BUT the dust boot on the ball joint is garbage. Installed on my 2000 Ford Explorer XLT about 4 years ago which was a slow project of mine and parked for a number of years (not driven). Finally finished up my project and drove 2 miles to alignment shop and was told my 0 mile (well, 2 miles now) upper control arm dust boots were torn. Took the upper control arms off and found the dust boots had pretty much disintegrated just sitting on the parked truck. Sad. Now I need either new boots (maybe energy suspension poly boots) or replace the ball joint completely if any contamination degraded the bearings.

This is a review of the SMAKN 12V 5A Female Car Cigar Cigarette Lighter Socket.Summary  This is working perfectly for what I needed. I have a vehicle that the DC outlets are always live even when the vehicle is off. I used this in conjunction with a mini fuse tap kit to tap into an unused fuse on my vehicle that only is on when the vehicle is on.  (For a dash camera.)The outlet feels well-made and comes with the positive and negative leads stripped and ready for your own connections. The rating of this outlet is up to 5amps at 12v. My connection using the included dc dash cam adapter was not overly tight and was snug. (I ended up taping the dc plug to the socket as a precaution so that vehicle vibration does not allow it to become loose.)Note  The cable is actually 11 long. The 35cm (13.77) is the length including the socket portion.As with all my reviews, I will update this review should this develop any issues with ongoing use.

Gates, what is this goo? And how much is in the upper radiator hose connector that I can't see and clean?  Seriously, how much grease are you having me introduce into my cooling system?  You warn me several times on your packaging and in the enclosed literature that the number one leading cause of a water pump failure is not flushing and cleaning the system.  Well, physician heal thyself. Gates has gone international, it's quality has gone down hill big time and is surviving off a a reputation developed more than 30 years ago.  I have consistent issues with gates products from their Chinese water pumps to their mismarked belts. Yes, I should have known better.

Took me a while to order this one debating between it and a less expensive version. I'm glad I got it, I would recommend 100%... the quality is what you would expect and the weight is a plus.I have a 2002 Sentra SER Spec V with a 10x1.25 thread had no issues installing it.

I decided to try this wax on my daily driver and was not disappointed. I normally polish with a DA and then top off with a wax. I decided to leave that process for my weekend baby and use the ice paste on my daily driver truck. I thought about polishing first but from my research online I gathered that the formula of ice would remove the fillers and resins of a polish in its application. Therefore I simply went with a wash and clay, then application of the wax. I primed the pad provided and found application rather easy finishing the entire vehicle in under 15 minutes. I used the "pro tip" on the box and left the entire vehicle to dry and used a spritz of ice spray detailer to remove. This process helped, but the wax is still on the hard side for removal. Also be prepared to go through 3-4 towels in the removal process to make life easier unless you want a shoulder workout. The fibers of my towels got filled up with wax pretty quickly when wiping off. I left it in the garage to cure for 24 hours and the shine is solid. Doesn't pop like the "boutique brand" waxes I normally use but for the price it's totally worth it. The ice paste and spray detailer are the only Turtle Wax products in my detailing collection but they get 2 thumbs up from me. I shall follow up in a few weeks with beading and durability updates.Update: September 2016 (6 months)I added a second coat to the truck a few weeks after my initial application. The second coat was not as easily applied or buffed off as the first coat, leading me to believe that one coat every detail should be fine. 2 coats while providing greater protection may be a bit unnecessary albeit personal preference, 3 coats would definitely be overkill. I should also note that I store this in normal room temperature, I have reached for the wax on a couple occasions for use after minor corrections on other vehicles and noticed an oily liquid separated from the wax, i simply stirred up the wax with my fingers and it was fine but not sure if this separation affects anything application or performance wise just thought id share.Onto the durability and beading update - so far so good, the gloss is still there and the truck cleans very easily. a jet of water takes off most of the light dust and my wash mitt gets the rest with no effort whatsoever. the beading is there but not as aggressive as when it was freshly applied. I do use quick detailer (QD) spray as a drying aid unless I'm using my blower for a touch less dry. I'm sure the detailer spray helps maintain the beading a bit but I would recommend everyone to use QD anyway. Therefore I cannot update purely on the beading of the wax itself after the months gone by but with the help of QD its solid.That being said, this is about as far as the wax will go on my truck. Being a true curious detailing enthusiast, I have a new product lineup to try out in the coming weeks so the ICE paste will be no more. I do recommend it for the performance, durability and price factors. I still have at least half the tin remaining so I shall use it on a couple other cars including my moms which is more neglected paint that sleeps outside. That should be a true test to see what its worth so look out for another update in a few months time. Also the reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the minor difficulty in buffing off after application.

It's definitely a good looking antenna and it helps me accomplish the look I was going for.  It was also a direct fit with no adapters in my 2004 Ford Ranger 4.0 Edge Extended cab.  My gripe is the reception, I'd say it's about half as strong as it used to be with local geography and topology being a much larger factor than it used to be.  That being said, I don't listen to the radio very often and when I do it's the major stations for news and what not so It works for me.

A tree limb fell on my small folding camper, an A-Liner, and punched a hole in the fiberglass roof about an inch across. I cut out the cracked and damaged part, filled it in with foam, then patched it with Marine-Tex. The pot life seems 3 or 4 hours, so you have plenty of time to work. The mix ratio is 5:1, with a 10% allowance. The stuff is sticky as all heck. You can't smooth it out with a putty knife, you can only glump it in and sand it down later. Be sure you wear rubber gloves! I let it cure overnight and masked the area around it with tape to avoid cutting into the gel coat while sanding. It sands down fairly fast, about 20 minutes, going from 80 grit to 120 to 200 to 320. The white is a close match for the white camper. You wouldn't notice the patch unless I pointed it out to you. The sanding did reveal a few bubbles in the epoxy but I expected that. You have to look closely to see them. This is the first time I've used Marine-Tex and, overall, I'm very pleased. Marine-Tex is great stuff, easy to use, tolerant as to mix ratio and temperature, and it cures rock-hard.

Update: Amazon has now been updated to reflect a proper 2016 truck fit. Yay Amazon!Most definitely fits 2016. I tried notifying Amazon to update their "My Garage", but I'm sure the wheels turn a little slow at corporate. I included a photo of the labels on the boxes depicting fit for verification purposes.The only thing that could make these easier to install, is if it came with little elves that did it for you. Part of the credit needs to go to the vehicle manufacturer for such ideal bolt placement, but the cam-lock on the rear flaps are pretty cool too. These fit like a glove, and even have a gutter molded in for the silicone bead in the front fender well.Initial reaction to this product is very impressive. I got all 4 installed before I even finished my first cup of coffee for the day, so that's really saying something for me!

These lights are awesome!! They are so much brighter than my old stock lights in my Toyota Corolla. They are a bright white color and illuminate the entire front of my car. They took about 1 minute total to install in my front overhead light. When I initially installed each bulb, the light did not come on, however, as soon as I flipped them around, they worked perfectly (you have to flip them to reverse the polarity). Overall, I am VERY happy with these bulbs and would definitely recommend them to others.*Discounted product received for testing and review purposes.

This snowbrush seems very well made. I really like that it is made in the USA. Not many products these days are made in America, and I was surprised that something as simple as a snow brush had not been outsourced to China yet. The price here on Amazon is also very good, considering the two day shipping if you have prime. I bought mine at a gas station for about $8. There is however, one issue with the snowbrush. As many reviewers have noted, the ice scraper end of the brush is angled from north to south in relation to the brush. Most snowbrushes have the ice scraper going from west to east in relation to the brush. This causes issues with the ice scraper scratching the paint on your car as you use the brush part. This is a major design issue. Luckily it can be fixed fairly easily. Although it does not seem like it at first, the ice scraper does swivel on the end of the brush. It is very difficult to get the scraper to spin. For me it took two people. One to hold the brush still, and another to spin the ice scraper around. Once I figured this out this has been a great brush! I am really surprised that the manufacturer shipped these brushes the way they did, it doesn't seem smart. At least it can be fixed though! Overall this brush is highly recommended,  it seems more heavy duty than others, and the grip is very thick.

Perfect fit for 2014 Sienna SE. Took about 2 hours to install. Take your time since it is heavy to line up the bolts if it is a one person job. I used  stuff laying around on either side to raise it up bit by bit till I could bolt it in.

Easy install, plug and play 2007 Harley Ultra Classic.  One of the top rated led head lamp, not sure why Truck Lite did not correct the flaw in making the light so stock headlight chrome ring would fit.Head light does protrude about 5/8 inch, giving the bike an unfinished looked.  Adding Kuryakyn 7275 Chrome 7" Headlamp Trim Ring is only sold with grooves, topping off the misery, finishing the install,  the chrome ring is not tight, you can spin it.  Not sure how this will work with vibration of Harley motor but time will tell.  Truck Lite obviously is at the top of the game with led head lights for Harley but come on, reduce the depth 5/8" of your light allowing Harley Davidson owners to use stock chrome ring. For some, having the light stick out nearly an inch is no big deal, some also never wash, polish or service their bikes, I DO.  With that said, the light is awesome, big time improvement over stock.  Worth the purchase from Truck Lite.  Posted a picture showing difference between stock headlamps and driving lights.  Truck Lite LED head light matches driving lights in a bright whiter illumination.  I don't mind paying the price for good quality products.  Just seems this is getting harder and harder to do, high prices, sub-standard quality control

I had a little trouble with the nutsert, but the directions do state that if the nutsert won't stop turning [off of the bolt] then you can apply some of the included thread lock to the bolt, reinsert and wait for it to dry. I did that, plus added a little to the nutsert itself where it contacts that tailgate and held it there with some painters tape. I waited about 40 minutes and then tried again. Worked like a charm. Other than that the install took all of 10 minutes... if that. I've attached a few photos of the installed product plus a video of dropping and raising the tailgate after installation. I've come to expect pretty bad instructions from products these days but the set that comes with this kit are very good.

If you are the type of person who REALLY must know where your vehicle HAS been and need a rough estimate of how much you're spending in fuel costs, this device may be for you. If you want to know exactly when and where the idiot stopped quickly in front of you forcing you to slam on your brakes, or when you had to step on the gas to pass someone, this device may be for you. Or if you just want to be able to ask your Amazon Echo where you parked your vehicle (9 times out of ten will be in your driveway since your Echo is likely at home) or how far you drove last week, then this device may be for you.Otherwise, this device is pretty worthless. It even interferes with Chevy OnStar (even the basic functions), so mine will be removed and sold.

I recently added a SW Motech Aluma Rack to my FZ09 and this tail bag is a perfect match for it. It high quality and looks good. It keeps it's shape when empty and it will expand in height about 30% if need be. The included attachment straps should work on just about any bike and they are sturdy. It also comes with a very nice rain fly. This is not my first Nelson-Rigg product and it will not be the last.

Got mine today (JAn-2018) Came with metal end clips and the four quarter turn plastic clips .  I haven't tested it for fit yet.  The plastics appears to be alittle thinner than 2001 OEM, definitely lighter overall weight.  This doesn't have as many cross ribs behind the center chrome bar as OEM.  I would call the color black, more of a dark grey.

Don't listen to the reviews saying its too loud. When engine braking in 4-5th gear you will get an exhaust pop. I honestly love it. Its aggressive and turns heads in a good way. Chics love it.

I thought these would be nice for my front turn signals in my 2003 Ford F-150.  I think the bulbs are of decent quality, but the problem is they only have two SMT LEDs.  Their effectiveness in your car's application is highly dependent on the reflector design inside your vehicle's housing.  In my case, these bulbs are almost impossible to see flashing in the daytime from the side.  From the front they are somewhat visible, and probably OK.  I did use the same type of bulb (Red version) in my taillights and there it works great from all angles.  But in this front turn signal application, these bulbs are not very effective as turn signal indicators.

Fits perfectly and adds a really nice touch to the interior of my truck, but more importantly, to me, is it will protect the top of the center console. The red RAM logo on top of this cover really adds a nice accent and looks sharp. I put this on my brand new black 2016 RAM 2500 crew cab, 6.4 Hemi truck. I want the interior of my truck to be protected as well as reasonably possible and this is one way to do that at an unbeatable price Very fast shipping. I highly recommend it.

I just noticed that one of the straps used to secure to cover when rolled up is not installed though. The first time I've needed to roll it up is why I guess I didn't see it until now (a couple months later). It'd be nice to get this sent to me at some time in the near future. Otherwise, great cover, great price and very simple (30 minutes) to install on my own.

This is my second set from powerstop. I have only installed and tested so far. So I'll update if issue arise. Install was no issue. Total time was just under 45 mins. Hardest part was removing the old rotor. All clearances were fine.  Testing was simple. And breakin was simple (you do get weird looks when you go from 40 to 10 , 10 times in a row).We replaced due to vibration in the stock set when braking from 55+ down to a stop. So far these do not do that. Smooth and grabs much better.They look pretty sweet too.I was not given these for this review. Bought from my own money.

Heres the secret to temptation: Dont fight it. Just refocus. Whatever you resist persists.Did you know that in the Bible, not once are you told to resist temptation? We are told to resist the Devil, and thats a whole different issue. But the key to overcoming temptation is not to push back. Its to change your focus.Whatever gets your attention gets you. The battle for sin always starts in the mind. Thats why the Bible says in Psalm 119:6, Thinking about your commands will keep me from doing some foolish thing (CEV). Why? Because if you're thinking about Gods truth, you're not thinking about the less important stuff.Its true in every single area of life  good or bad. If you focus on godly things, its going to pull you that direction. If you focus on the stuff thats at the movies and in magazines, its going to pull you that direction. Whatever you focus on gets your attention. Whatever gets your attention is going to get you.The key is to just change your mind.;-PB

Large easy to read dial.  The valve nipple rotates to any position you want to easily read the gauge.  Holds pressure well until released by release button. If you're looking for a compact gauge this isn't it.  If you want a meaty easy to read gauge, this will work great.

Great light bar. The mount and light bar are top notch. The light bar is bright! I do wish there was room underneath the bracket at the bottom to run the power wire for the light bar for a cleaner install, but it's not a deal breaker. Comes with everything you need; harness, relay, switch. I don't think you could find better quality and fit in this price range.

I bought these filters for 2013 Mazda 5 Sport.  If you want replace these filter yourself, I would highly recommend watching a video on Utube by "sigor2011".  The filters are located in the very awkward location, where you would need to remove two plastic panels, disconnect two wiring plugs and remove four screws.  Using a stubby Philips screw driver will be of great benefit.  Reinstalling the filters is almost as awkward as getting to them in the first place.  These filters stack on top of each other in the housing, so patience is required.  Once the top filter is properly located, the bottom will slide in place with a very slight effort.  Just pay attention to the groves on the filters and the housing.  The dealer was quoting me $99 to replace the filters, but I would rather pay a quarter of that and about 20 minutes of my time instead.  After 3 years and 25,000+ miles, the OEM filters were not that bad looking, but were due for replacement.

I rate the steps at 5 stars!!! The instructions I rate at 1 star!!! The reason being there very vague and not enough information. On my 2009 GMC HD I had to purchase other bolts for my install, which is a pain if you have already started the install. The brackets came with 1/2" bolts and we all know that vehicles are metric. So with that being said I needed 4 different bolts for the front end of installation. I would recommend the steps to any truck owner they look STUD!

 The decals come in a regular envelope and instructions on how to apply them. Shipping was quick.  I used them on the mirrors of a motorcycle (2007 Kawasaki Ninja ZX14)  I cleaned the mirrors and allowed it to dry with no streaks or dust particles.  I then cut the paper the decals came with into 2 halves so that I would have the left and the right decals separate (they send one paper with both decals)  Make sure that you have marked, either with a marker/pencil or visually, where you want the letters to be on the side mirrors. The letters remain on the surface of the mirrors as the holding paper is removed. Remove the upper paper and then, after carefully selecting where you want the letters to be, place the translucent paper on the side mirror.  I used a Subway card (you can use a credit/debit/points card) to press the letters to the mirrors. Make sure you press the letters a few times to ensure that they have stuck well to the mirrors.  The letters look good, give the mirrors another/different look and do not take away the ability of the rider/driver to use the mirrors for viewing traffic behind them.  It is an inexpensive way to spruce up your side mirrors.  They look like they are durable. I haven't ridden in the rain and when I occasionally clean my mirrors, the letters stay stuck. If they fall out Ill give an update.

I have set this tent up in my 07 Tundra standard bed 3 times now....It takes some wrestling with the components to make it happen with one person doing the work.....Once the tent is up it is very good quality except for the velcro that affixes the canvas to the poles....they really skimped on the velcro.....a couple of the velcro pieces don't even grab well enough to be functional.....I also had to improvise where the poles meet the bed of the truck.....I took a piece of wood and drilled 3 holes so the poles would go through the wood then attach to the provided hardware and secured them with a plastic wire tie....this keeps the poles upright while you are trying to put the canvas over the top....In doing so im able to set the tent up without the poles coming off of the attachment base......

First of yeah I like these emblems I think they look nice.Pros: they are heavy and feel heavy duty. I have had them on now longer then a yeah and they still have their shine and no color loss. They look better than the originals. You can physically reshape them to fit your car with a lil elbow grease.Cons: the adhesive they use kind of sucks. They might stay on if you get a good pair if not your gonna have to get your own tape so they don't come off.

Remarkable shine for days and the paint even seems to repel dust. Prior to using this, I'd spend a good hour of elbow grease doing a curbside bucket wash and dry, then monthly polish. it would look good for a few days. Then the car would get dusty and my feelings hurt from all that effort not counting for very long. This product takes me fifteen minutes to apply and wipe off in sections. It picks up dirt very well and leaves a wet shine. Consider this if you have to park your car outside. I am so glad I bought it and for the price it is worth it since the supply is generous. I use maybe 4oz on my car, that's it. The company stands by its products. Highly recommended for the enthusiast who likes their car looking 100% gorgeous all the time.  I hope it also protects my paint from the elements for years b/c the car is parked outside all the time.

If you have a Shoei RF1200. You need to get this shield. First of all, it looks amazing. It completely change the way your helmet looks. It will go from blah... to I will never take this shield of the helmet. Build quality-wise  its very sturdy, well made. It has a new lip on the very top and Botton, that I am not a very big fan of, but it is for extra rigidness. Pinlock works great. Not an issue. Yes, it is chrome on the outside, nut if you compare it with the dark smoke it is lighter. However this is the only shield you will need. I mean you won't need to carry a clear one for night riding. During the day people can not se your face at all and it is dark enough to the point that if you are riding towards the sun you won't squint at all. During the night it is light enough that you have no visibility issues. I have a reflective stripe I put on the top inside lip of the helmet that at point black with flash a picture will show it as you can see in one of the pictures but that is the only way you can see inside during the day.  I ride at night constantly with it. I even tossed out my clear shield.

Installed on my riding mower,LOL, for when this time change screws me out of daylight when I get home from work. Lights up the yard very well and I can see almost as well as if it were daytime.

I was planning on upjetting before installing, good thing I did. When I opened up the carb the jet was broken and was a pain to take off. I'm lucky I didn't damage the stem trying to turn the 85 jet. The rest of the carb looked nice and the fuel filter added was nice. QC needs to be addressed at Glixial.

Works great. Used in dash. Because of the way LEDs use less amperage the range of adjustment for dimming is not as wide and stays pretty much fully lit. Shines a Good blue. My camera doesn't do it justice.

very happy for about a year now my left headlight is out and I cannot get ANY light to work in its place.  I checked the fuse and its fine.  It must have shorted out something elsewhere in the truck.  what a pain in the arse.  The low beam LED's are charred black.  I have no idea what to do.

Had this cover for 1 year now.  I live in the tropics but the fabric is dry rotted already.  I will buy another brand next time.  Not sure if it the humidity here or poor quality of the materials used.  Yeah, the cover was only fifty bucks but I expected it to last for more than a year.  Cheers

The reflective material that customTAYLOR33 uses is literally the best of the best. Not only does it reflect EXTREMELY well, but the adhesion is strong. Your imagination is your only limit with this. Great quality for the price. I've made many orders and am addicted to putting reflective strips on everything I own now! (My Moped looks like something out of the movie TRON haha!)

Holy crap is this thing beefy. I have used it as a come-along a couple of times to get me out of some sticky situations. It is, in my opinion, one of the best on the market. Remember you get what you pay for and this proves it over some of the cheaper options out there. A good off road motto is always do it right the first time.My only regret was getting the 60" as opposed to the 48". This now makes the clearance height of my rig 7.5'

Because I did not receive the item advertised, I am leaving this seller 2 stars. However, because what I received will work for what I need it for, Im keeping them, but Im still in a search for sellers that sell what they advertise. I feel like what I received is old stock and outdated. The fact that the housings paint was chipped and the bubble what even looked really old, Im going with old stock.I purchased these 6 18w LEDs on April 29, 2018. What I received did not match the advertised description, but they work and this is my 3rd Attemp to get a seller to send me what they are advertising. Compared to other similar products that seem to have some kind of magnified feature, these are very bright and project a beam nicely at about 30ft. Again I did not receive the item described but these do work.

Not sure why some people complain about installing them.  The directions aren't all that great but there are plenty of videos that show you how to do it.  It took me about 4 hours....hungover.  Probably would have only taken about 2 hrs normally.  The hardest part was jacking it up to take the weight off of the suspension.  I don't have lift but it I did, it would have been about 30 min quicker.  I just used some 6x6s under a 3 ton jack and jacked up on the rear cross member.  The second hardest part was getting the air out of the bags in order to put them inside the spring.  I had to use some additional zip ties to wrap around the bag.  Once all the air was out and it was zip tied, they were easy to get in the spring.  The instructions tell you that you have to drill a hole at the top of the spring where there is this rubber grommet type thing.  Luckily my 2009 yukon xl already had the hole there.  Doing that would have been a pain in the butt.  The rubber is very hard.  If you have a sharp spade bit and a "wobbly" attachment for a drill that's probably the best method.  Running the lines from the bags was easy.  Then install the heat shields on the exhaust where it makes sense.  I didn't have an air compressor either so I just used my bike pump to them up to 35 psi.  It didn't take much effort.  I left 35 psi in there overnight expecting it to go down to about 30 psi but  they didn't lose any pressure.  Some people complain about leaks but I'm assuming they didn't get the lines over the fittings very far.  Mine have been perfect ever since.  I run 10 psi normally and 35 psi when I'm towing.  Look at the difference!

Almost the same review as BBD, really kind of upset I spent the money on this, followed the directions to a T, even spent the time to tape off the top.Here is BBD review: I washed the top as instructed, which worked very nicely. However, the sealant makes a big mess because of the nozzle dripping, as others have noted. Also, after applying two coats, which used the entire bottle of sealant, I went out to check out the "beading" action after a recent rain less than 5 days after treating, and found the top saturated as if nothing had been applied. Disappointing after all the work cleaning up the overspray and drips from the car's paint and glass.

This is not my first purchase of this item, I have used this on my last 3 cars I have owned and it is worth every penny. This is more a sealant than a wax but still works beautifully. I usually wash, clay, polish and then use this product followed up by a wipe down with Meguiars D156 and my truck is smooth as glass with a deep rich shine. There are a TON of products out there to wax your vehicle however MOST of them will stain your black plastics and trim, this product does NOT. This product can be used in direct sunlight, the same with D156. These two products together make a stellar combo for keeping your vehicle protected and looking its best.

I needed up buying 2 of these. Came well packaged and came on time ( I have 2 day prime ) I bought these to replace old wheel bearings . These are a steal for this price! Another great product from Amazon that you can't beat the price else where! Now don't get me wrong Amazon is somtimes more money on certain things but this is a great deal! Product works amazing ! And is well worth buying! Product is still working great!

in the past I have used the exact same kit that was branded by Matco.  This is the exact same kit, with the exact same quality, for a lower price. The only difference between the two is the color of the case and the background on the gauge. This tool is absolutely necessary for anyone trying to diagnose mechanical issue on any type of gasoline engine. It has every adapter you will need as well as a very useful solid extension for getting into deeper cylinder heads.

THE PART #S ARE FLAPS DESIGNED FOR FACTORY OEM FLARES. I TOOK A CHANCE ON THESE AND IT PAID OFF.THE FIT IS GOOD, NOT EXCELLENT. THERE ARE SMALL GAPS BETWEEN FLARES AND FLAPS.BUT NOTHING I CAN NOT LIVE WITH.EASY INSTALL, ONLY 2 SCREWS PER FLAP I DID DRILL OUT THE HOLES ON FLAPS TO ALLOW FOR ADJUSTMENT AND FIT.GOOD QUALITY AND FINISH ON FLAPS.

Does not fit the inner surface of the bumper as other 1 star reviews have noted. Instructions were very simple, and for a hitch that fit the truck would have been adequate.Shipped with Curt bolts and parts with instructions in a bag inside the hitch, in the Amazon box was about 20 5/8" bolts, random, and loose in the box with the shipping material.Did not have to drill.Did not have to remove any shims or crossmembers.Used some washers to space the bumper out from the hitch mount bolts. Makes bumper stick forward about 1/2", looks a little weird, but was easiest way to make it work.Installed on a 2000 Ford F250, 4x4.

Great product, everything you need to do the job for 16" apes.  Good quality and looks good. The hardest part ist getting the wires out of the stock connectors so you can add the extended wires.

Fast shipping. If you can change out Christmas light bulbs, you can do this. There was no real modification to do with these. The maps lights aren't as bright as the others but it is more due to the design of the map light on Ford Excursions and how the light reflects down rather than shine directly into the vehicle. These replacement bulbs are bright and really do look good.

Lights came a day late. FedEx is to blame. Other than that lights are bright and fit. You do have to cut the metal band that is blocking the lights from snapping into place. I did notice that the bulb socket where the tail light plugs in didn't have a gasket to prevent moisture to get in. I covered that up with a piece of plastic and some silicone.

Brighter than factory 194, Gives it a better presence at night. However if you have a factory back- up camera (My 2010 Subaru Tribeca Picture Here has it) like the brighter bulbs do reflect more while the camera is on but I'm okay with it Putting these bulbs on my 2003 Astro van as well. Seeing how long would these last compare to the standard versions.

Mounting on a 2016 Ford Escape: Like the quality and finish, Ford factory rack is set at only 2 cross bar positions which required me to take to my local welder to add 1.5" extension [in the middle] so that the locking blocks center perfectly on the crossbars. I also had him weld the two pieces into on since I have the room to store it as a full size basket. I am debating on having a linex or rhino finish applied for ultimate longevity since I will be using this thing a lot [just bought the car and not getting rid of it anytime soon]. Not the fault of the rack but wish the OEM rack's cross bars were movable like all the other vehicles I have ever owned. I loose-laid the rack on the vehicle and it looks good...not too small and not crazy big, it will make outings easy to be able to put chairs, coolers, etc. up there. We own a full size Dodge Ram too but many times parking it on outings stinks as well as it getting half the gas mileage as the Escape.It was a considerable amount of money more than MANY options out there, Rack Attack is reputable and had a great price through Amazon. Item came new, prefect in the factory box as promised. It is easy to assemble and as I said before super quality that most of the lesser brands just cant match.I tossed the plastic oem fairing and had metal added, also added three chain links as lashing points at frt and rear, lastly had it Rhino coated for durability once all my welding mods were done. At this point it does not look like a Yakima basket...see pix. It should outlast the car though...

There was not enough difference between the low and high brightness, so at night when the tail lights were on and you hit the brakes it was barely brighter. These look to be very close to the same as the old incandescents I wanted to replace.In the pictures and video the left light is the LUYED light and the right is the old 1157 incandescent bulb. I also have an LED 3rd light bar so you can tell which still is with just the lights and which with the brakes (when the center bar is lit). You can see in the pictures that the basic tail light on level is a bit brighter than stock, which is actually good. The other photo with the brakes pressed you can see the brightness is pretty much the same. In the video you can see that when I hit the brakes it is obvious, as well as the faster response of the LED.One thing that is misleading is the specs for the brightness. These are not really 800 Lumens, as that is a measure of the light across all wavelengths, and these only put out perfect red light. Compared to the Bulbeats, these look really dim to the naked eye. But put them, into a tail light housing with a red lens in front and they look the same or brighter.Another advantage of these over the others is that they are red LEDs instead of white. Since they are shining through a red lens, the bright white LEDs actually look at bit orange. You can't tell in these pictures and video, but the LED is a nice, deep red color.The reason you should get these over the Bulbeats is that you can easily tell that the brakes are on, and that is the main reason for having brake lights. This review was written the first day, so I can't tell about longevity. If one goes bad, I'll update the review so you know how long it lasted.

This headlight came decently quick, even though it was from China. The box showed up DESTROYED. I was convinced that the item would be damaged but miraculously it wasn't. Upon first impression this thing feels very cheap. It feels like a toy. I was not successesful in wiring up the turn signals, and the bulb that came with the headlight is garbage. I don't trust this thing to be water tight one bit, and I would not recommend it to a friend. Looks good on my bike, but it's still the 100% plastic thing that gets me.

This is a value priced off road tire that has an aggressive tread and when on the highway, makes the expected amount of road noise.  I am currently replacing my second tire (under the warranty that Amazon sells with each tire) due to sidewall failure.Please note that I wheel offroad on fairly difficult and rocky trails, and both instances of sidewall failure are due to airing down and hitting rocks.These tires perform well on the beach in all types of sand and very well in the 36" of snow we had in Maryland last winter.I run the 32x11.5 15 on my 1992 Jeep Wrangler YJ with a 2.5L engine and 4" lift.  I chose the 32" size for a combination of clearance and the ability to use 5th gear in my Jeep while travelling the highways to and from the areas where I wheel.

I used this plug to replace one that put in place my the previous owner. It looks great, has a good fit/finish, and I'm overall very happy with it.For Superduty owners (or anyone that can use the tip), I drilled a hole in the center of the mounting bracket, put a long 5/16" bolt with washers through, and used lock nuts to lower the mounting height of the bracket in order to clear the lip under my bumper. Worked like a charm.

These are awesome! I ordered and received them before the scheduled delivery date. Here's the good stuffThe Fit:  is perfect OEM look and the grommet stays are in the perfect place - they slid right in and were just like the carpeted originals.The Look: is top-notch. The rubberized material should wear even better than the carpeted OEM versions. I personally love the texture (I saw a couple of other comments) and think they will clean up very well. The Hummer Logo is great and I think really adds to the look of my interior.I am very satisfied with my purchase and would gladly buy again for other vehicles. Highly, highly recommended!!

This cover fit my 1975 Corvette great. Comes with instructions and two small cutouts for the antenna, adhesive backed, and they stick well to the fabric. Comes with a storage bag, straps for tying it down. Advertised as a 7 layer cover, and it feels like it, soft inner liner that feels like cotton, so it doesn't scratch the paint on the car. I had purchased another cover a couple of years back, paid more money for it and this cover is far more sturdy and durable. When my old one wears out a little more,on my other Corvette, I will be ordering another one of these. Excellent car cover. I do not receive any compensation for this review, this is my honest review and opinion.

Excellent pump for potable water - quiet - easy to install.Although it is not noted in the description, this pump is suitable for potable water. This means that it can be used for drinking water. DO NOT use a pump that is not certified for potable water for ANY installation where the water will be used for consumption or food preparation.I was able to wire the pump to a heavy cord and heat shrink it to keep the elements out of the line, ensuring safe operation and portability. The pump works exactly as it should and is very quiet. I mounted the pump and a tank to a framework made of 2x4s for a friend's concession trailer and it works like a charm. This is a potable water pump, so you can use it for drinking water or commercial purposes where the water is used for consumption. It is VERY important to ensure that you use a potable water pump for ANY application that will be used for consumption.The self-priming functionality is perfect, as I was able to simply drop a hose into the water tank and turn the pump on and water began to flow quickly. I let the pump run the container dry and it worked as it should. The pump has a pressure sensor to turn itself off when it encounters enough resistance. The instructions recommend NOT attempting to pump water more than six feet above the pump level.Features:Potable water pump3 gallons per minuteSelf-priming55 PSIInternal bypass-low cyclingQuiet operationRuns dry  thermally protectedBuilt-in check valve115 volt

Bought for a 2 door 09 JK. Where to begin...The Bad:The track bar bracket that they included was fabbed sloppy and you could visibly see the holes were off. One of the rear shock adapter brackets was also off causing much cursing. The rear spacers looked really weird, almost like the mold wasn't filled correctly or something. Oh, and whoever thought up the idea of making all of the replacement fasteners 1mm bigger than the OE parts is a malevolent human being.The Good:Instructions were better than I was expecting and everything seems to be of a decent/good quality. If you have a shop and all the right tools installation is easy peasy. I got about an extra 4 inches of total height. I'm not complaining, but it may surprise those with a 2 door without aftermarket bumpers, winches, etc because you get a noticable height increase. I'm now looking for a good set of side steps and handles.... This kit also comes with shock adapters, which is great because your shocks will be maxed otherwise.It took me 12 hours by myself, partially due to lack of proper tools and partially fighting poorly fabricated parts. It gives my Jeep a great look though and with a bit of ingenuity and determination it wasn't too bad. Time will tell how it holds up.*UPDATE 6/2018* This kit has held up fabulously. I have put roughly 20k miles on it, as well as taking trips to the mountains, Moab, wherever, and there are no signs of this kit having issues. I ended up replacing my front driveshaft due to increased pinion angles ripping the cv boot on the t-case side, but I blame the mileage on the driveshaft more than the lift itself, and if you are looking at lifting your jeep, you should have some new driveshafts on your to-do list in the future anyway.

Here are a few things1. Wiring is backwards had to reverse the polarity. When i pluhged it in the up and down made it go right and left and left and right made them up and down2. Heavy mirrors good quility. On the 2002 silverado the start point on where the mirror sets is not tucked in enough for my preferance.3. We will see how the mirros hold up in time.4. I added conved 3in circle mirror to helkpo see my 20ft trailer5. Grreat length on the pull out to extend mirrors ( a bit stiff at first)

These fit my Jeep Wrangler Perfect.  I took of the head rest first.  They were a perfect fit for an 09 Jeep wrangler x.  I don't care they are not total sheepskin. The part you are coming into contact with is sheepskin the other part is synthetic. I bought these because I hate leather seats in AZ they are hot and slimy.

I purchased this to replace the chrome front emblem on a 2014 Jeep Wrangler. All my accents were black and because I have no chrome the old stock emblem seemed out of place. This Jeep Emblem comes with a clear sticker on each side so you can see through to the surface of your vehicle when mounting. It's a very easy install. Simply use fishing line to remove the old emblem, stick the new emblem in the old one's footprint and you're done. Picture included. Takes about 5 minutes or less to install.

This is my review for the 9006 version of this LED headlight.Very nicely built.  When you feel them in your hands they feel like quality.  The design is fanless so no noise emitting from the bulbs.  It is slightly larger than the original non-led bulbs so depending on your application fitment needs to be checked.I installed these in the fog lights of my 2010 Toyota Sienna.  They fit well and were easy to install.  I just twisted off the old bulb, twisted these AuxBeam Led bulbs in, and connected the wire.  I like that it doesnt have any additional boxes to connect so everything is easy to tuck away.  The connectors do have a little length compared to the stock halogen bulbs so the bulb wire from your car might hang depending on how your vehicle is designed.Light emitted by these bulbs is nice and clear.  For the most part they are white with a slight tinge of blue I would say.  The color being 6500k as stated on the product page is accurate I would say given my experience with other lighting ratings.The bulbs themselves come nicely packed in a nice sturdy box.  The box is filled with a foam type material that the bulbs slip into so they are well protected.  Also included are color films you can add to the Led bulbs to change the color produced.I didn't get a before picture but I added an output picture in my review to show the color of the bulbs.Overall I find these bulbs to be well constructed and produce a good amount of light.  A big upgrade in color appearance over my stock halogen bulbs.I also purchased the 9005 version of this bulb.  Same quality in construction.  Fit my 2015 Chevy Colorado high beam headlights.  Produce a nice white light as well.  See pictures for old halogen vs these led comparison.I received this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review

These are more of a novelty or show item IMHO.  They are great looking but small.  The description states mirror size as 4" x 2-3/8". This measurement must include the frame because actual viewable mirror size  is approximately 3-1/2 x 2-1/4" tapering to approximately 1-1/2" at the outside.  Do yourself a favor if you are purchasing these for regular use, sketch and cut out a piece of paper using the picture as a reference for shape and tape the cut-out on your existing mirrors (if you have them) to indicate just how small these are. I tried them for a few days and will keep them for a back-up but will be purchasing larger mirrors as direct replacements.  I'm replacing the existing for cosmetic issues from the previous owner who was apparently balance challenged.

Run incredibly hot, died after a few weeks in a DRL socket. So hot in fact, that they discolored the plastic headlight housing. I now avoid these cheap Chinese LEDs, and stick with Philips or Sylvania. They aren't as bright, but don't die after 30 hours or run so hot they destroy $1k headlights...

I've had the PLX AFR Wideband gauge in my Camaro for several months now, and have had zero problems. I also installed their boost/vacuum sensor connected to another DM-6 gauge. Both look great! My only real complaint would be the instructions to wire the wideband to replace an existing narrow band are non-existent. I know that is difficult to have handy since a lot of car manufacture's narrow band wiring are different, but would be nice to have some common ones available for reference. I ended up giving up, and just had a separate bung welded in for the wideband.

Hard to give a star rating to a product that didn't fit.Its common for sellers to omit product dimension. (I don't think its an innocent omission)product dimensions. 1/8" thick  by 3 1/2" overall by 7/8" wide - 1 1/4" T-headfinish is not chrome. its the same you'd see from this material at Home Depot.I realize this is primarily for D-Ring clasps.

I have an 1974 motorhome with two seats in the front that are separated by the fiberglass motor cover. So I had nothing in which to store any small items and change, or hold drinks. So I mounted the console to the motor cover so that the passenger and driver would both have cup holders (2 on each side). With the added height of the motor cover it is the perfect height as a drink holder and mini-table top. I put my small items and change into the bottom slide out drawers. And I keep papers, a flashlight, batteries, wet wipes , etc. inside of the main compartment. The top of the compartment nicely holds small snacks as I am driving. I really don't need the inside light. I used bolts and wing nuts to fasten it to the motor cover. Honestly, its light enough that I can just unlatch the motor cover and pick up the console and cover without unfastening it. For my purpose it was a perfect fit and I quite happy with the quality. Because it fits so well, most people just assume that its always been there.

After 329,000 miles the license plate lights on my 2008 Toyota Corolla finally bit the big one. After reading many reviews for Alla Lighting products I purchased and installed this product. Later that evening while driving along a dark country road, something in the rear view mirror caught my eye. It was these freakin' SUPER BRIGHT LEDs lighting up the road behind me. I couldn't resist stopping in the road (no traffic) to take the attached photo with my Droid RAZR MAX phone without a flash. NOTICE HOW THE HIGHWAY IS LIT UP!It seems as though whenever I find a great product that I really like, it is discontinued or outlawed soon thereafter so I will be buying an extra set of these in just case I need them at 658,000 miles.

Decent lights for the price. Very bright. Cord is on the same side for both lights - something to consider when you're mounting. I originally mounted these on the windshield but the cord was in the wrong spot for the driver side. Ended up using them as fogs and love them. These are the bottom lights in the pic.

Not quite what I was expecting. I assumed these would be similar to weather tech or husky liners. They do fit the front floor wells perfectly and cover the entire area, unlike the factory mats. The five star rating is for fitment at this point and I will update this review after they have been in use for a while.Aug 3 2015,  After five months of use, the mats seem to be holding up decently. They have not lost any form fitment and the Velcro like bottom really holds them in place. Today I had them out for a good scrub down (simple green and a brush) I noticed after they dried that the drivers side has a decent amount of wear, which makes the mat look dirty in those areas. I will update with pics.

This lock is all metal, no plastic as some reviewers have commented.  Don't know if the "plastic" comments are due to a design change (old plastic, new metal) or if customers are just confused because the sliding mechanism, which is metal, has been painted black and could be mistaken for plastic due to its color.  Super easy installation and it prevents the tailgate from being lifted off the truck.  Awesome product for under $20!  Easy and inexpensive way to keep your tailgate from being stolen.

Everything fit perfectly except where my air sensor mount was too big for the factory air sensor. I fixed this by adding some teflon tape around the base to secure it into the mounting hole. I completed this install in about 45 minutes with basic mechanical knowledge (I do not work on cars, I do residential and commercial construction) Sure makes the engine sound alive. First picture is original air intake, the other 3 are after new intake was installed.

My 2009 Jeep JK Wrangler Rubicon front axle was not centered after 2.5 inch lift installed. Stock track bar can not be adjusted to center the axle. This centering problem is thought to be a contributing factor to the Jeep JK "D wobble" experience.  I installed this adjustable track bar and it corrected the centering problem.  Please note there are no installation instructions included with the bar.  If you access Rubicon Express web site, you can find instructions for the bar included in one of their lift kit instructions.  You will also probably require adjustments to other suspension parts to correct steering wheel centering which is impacted when this bar is installed.  Steering wheel centering instructions for Jeep JK can be found using web search.

great product for the money! Holds up very good. Is very strong and heavy duty. turns night into day! It's crazy bright! And Looks great on my 03 Ram! Changed the whole look of the Truck! The mounts that come with it how ever are not ideal since they require you to put holes right into the cab ( if using for roof mounted).  Great service! Got it very quickly!Gave 4 stars because it did begin to hold moisture inside of it but if you just loose the ends of the lense is will release the pressure and air out the light bar. Personally, I took the whole front of it off and cleaned it and re-sealed it with some new rubber pieces I picked up at a local Home Depot. And it hasn't fogged up again since!

Nice heavy duty material. the instruction are easy to follow However there is one extra small bracket under the seat that  it need to be remove which it hold the seat electrical wires for the 2015 Jepp Wrangler. not a big deal only two screws to remove. now the right side hole does not line up perfectly with the hole to install back the bolt which hold your seat ( I made mine work). over all im happy with it; im going on vacation here soon and im planning to remove my doors and I can leave some of my beloning safe under the seat if I have to.  the instruction states that this does not work for some two door models.

I bought the 5.These running boards fit my 2016 chevrolet Silverado crew cab.Install is a breeze, roughly one hour. All hardware was included. Instructions are fairly straight forward. The only thing you will need instructions for is the passenger front bracket.  It isn't like the others. They send it like that because I assume there are some variations in different models or possibly a one size fits all across different trucks.One thing I love about these brackets is the amount of adjustability that is possible. You can slide them closer to the rear or front of the truck depending how far u want them. Also, you can slide them in and out. I didn't want them to stick out far, as in width, so I adjusted them all the way in. This will make more sense during install.The attached pics will show that they don't add width to the truck, if you don't want them to, and the sleekness of the design.They seem durable, having recently Installed them I cant comment on durability.

After rereading the instructions again I found out I had installed them incorrectly. Make sure ( And I thought I did) read the instructions very carefully. Once I did and follow the instructions carefully the windows rolled up and down the way their suppose to. No binding up .There is a part in the instructions you must pay close attention to. That's were I when wrong! Again sorry for the first post. I have in closed a picture of the instructions were to pay close attention to.

I  bought these wanting the look of the Sport Explorer without the price tag on my 2016 XLT. These look great and seem to be very high quality. They are not plastic but are actually metal and attached via double sided tape. I accidentally ordered the black letters first but the seller exchanged them for the chrome. Easy enough to install I just read some of the other reviews explaining it. I highly recommend this product.

I purchased this meter for my Electric Trike. I am running a 14S-12P Li-On battery pack at 58.8VDC fully charged. I use this as my gas gauge and tachometer (watching how many amps I draw as I ride). I replaced an LED meter because I could not read it in the day light. Since hooking this meter up I instantly noticed improved accuracy on my voltage and amp draws, and I can read it in the day light. I am still getting used to Wh instead of Ah readings. I know it is recommended for indoor use only, but a friend of mine has been using his outdoors for 18 months now and all is good. My meter is sealed from rain as an added precaution. I rarely draw much over 40 amps but thought I may change my system later on and might need something extra so I got the 100A version. Came nicely packaged with good instructions, easy to wire. I recommend this product.

I needed a budget-minded solution to achieve narrower and thinner fenders. These Smittybilts are a pretty good solution. My only issues are:1. The rear fenders should have been designed to follow the contour of the (cut/reused) inner wheel liners so that you avoid having these weird gaps. It is merely cosmetic, but a slight re-design of these fenders could make a positive difference (see pictures).2. The front fenders should accommodate the front side lights. I'm pretty sure you need it in most states (if not all) and I personally like the light for extra safety. So I had to do a goofy mount to make do for now. Ideally this product should have been designed to hold the light. For example, a little more metal and a hole to expose the light would have been perfect (see pictures).

Bought a 10 Pack of the 42mm 16SMD LEDs to fit out the interior of both a Mercedes C240 and Suburban.They've worked perfectly and are much brighter than the stock bulbs and very white!The only thing is that in the C240, even with everything 'off', the LED is still emitting a glow... there must be a very low current passing through and it's lighting up the LEDs a little. (i've attached photos to show this). It's low enough to not bother me, but for some people, they may find it distracting. The Suburban on the other hand, does not do this. When it powers off, everything is completely off.I have attached photos showing the results, and please note that my windows are tinted, so they are even brighter inside the cars!And for the price, you can't go wrong with these ! Great value, excellent results.

Buy from ECS Tuning.  $11.95 ea.I'm not sure about this oil - if it is correct for BMW M cars or not.  I have never seen this label before."EDGE" is on the bottle.  This is correct.Supposed to say: Manufactured in the EU (Europe) on the back.97% of the parts & fluids ECS sells are the lowest price.  They sell genuine OE & OEM stuff.No, I do not work for them.  But I did find them 3 years ago.  Use them all the time.  Saves me $$.Buy $200 & get free shipping.Very easy to tally $200 when you're keeping up with the maintenance of a BMW....... or any car really.Give them a try.But don't spend double from this vendor!

Terrible quality part. My sister bought me these as a birthday gift. The bolts supplied with this set seem to be steel, while the threads in the hood latches themselves are aluminum. This is a problem because steel is harder than aluminum and will strip the threads if they're under any stress/tension. Also, as I've found, if you have a Rubicon with a factory power dome hood, the latches themselves will make contact every time you close the latches. While driving down the highway, or as the hood experiences any movement, the hood latches will eventually eat into your paint...

...so I just could Not bear the thought of paying $200+ bucks per com device for my helmets. I saw this nice looking Lexin model with fairly good ratings and thought I'd give it a good test. Unit was delivery quickly and boxed nicely with everything needed including a soft-wired mic and a flexible, short boom style mic probably for an open face or modular helmet. I am a very active ADV rider on an R1200GS, oft riding dirt and street, even very rough trail riding... I've now a few hundred miles of cool, windy, hot, even a little rain and am mostly pretty pleased with this.  The install of it was fairly easy in my Fly Trekker ADV helmet.  The design of this helmet puts the speakers pretty close to ears so max volume is just this side of too loud (in other words, it's perfect). Every call I've received so far has been very clear, according to the callers and all noted NOT hearing any wind, road or motor noise!  I am rating this only 4 stars simply because about half the calls, the volume fluctuates in and out of very loud, making it difficult and slightly uncomfortable at times... This is really the only downside I have discovered so far.  On the upside, my audio books sound very good and the battery seems to hang in there fairly well though I've not exceeded more than about 3 hours on it so am not sure how long it will last before charging is needed... Overall, I would have to rate the B4FM as the best dollar value in this niche and am recommending it to all my fellow riders to try out... Keep in mind, that the speakers must be close to the ear but Not touching - the farther these speakers are from the ear, the less the rider will be able to hear - just how this type of speaker is.  On some helmets, you may need to get some velcro backed PE foam to bring the speakers closer to the ears - my Shoei RX-1100 is one of these where I'll need to do this but that is Not a con, just how some helmets are... You should also keep in mind that, as of yet, I've not tested a 2nd unit for my pillion passenger, nor with another rider so can Not attest to that function...

Lightweight. I didn't want the weight of a metal one. Haven't really gotten to use it yet but it'll work great for holding my tie down straps and small bottle jack. As other have said there isn't any seal on the lid so I'm going to get some weatherstripping foam tape and put it on the top to help seal it up from the driving rain. 4 lag screws are included to screw it down on the tongue. Locks with a padlock.

You have to supply a wire with a 1amp fuse holder in the middle. I used a 2 amp fuse and its worked just fine. You also have to provide a ground wire if you use one (you can just sand off to bare metal where the two mounting bolts go and that provides a ground-I did that but also attached a wire running from both bolts to double/triple ground it).2000 Ford Ranger. Loosen tail light. Tap into black wire with pink stripe going to clear reverse bulb with a wire that has a fuse holder (not included). Run your fused wire to positive on unit. Put in 1amp fuse (not included). Drill two mount holes and sand to bare metal around the holes. Mount the unit so the ground plate touches the bare sanded metal. For kicks I ran a ground wire (not included) between these two bolts.I've included photos-sometimes the mobile version of Amazon doesn't display pics in reviews so try desktop version.I mounted the unit behind a wall that is right behind where the tail light wires butt up against. There were cobwebs in there it was so safe and dry. Drill from where the tail light is hanging out and mount from underneath/behind.Silicon and electric tape and that was it. Wiring took two minutes. Mounting took ten.Reattach tail light.AWESOME and I already scared the neighbor's granddaughter on her tricycle (for safety).You need a wire with a fuse holder in the middle; possibly a short piece of wire for ground; solder iron; drill for mount holes; wrench; possibly a dremel to sand paint away for better ground; 1amp fuse; electric tape, silicon sealer is a good idea too.Had this on for about two weeks on Michigan and it's weathered snow, rain, freezing temps, flooded roads, 60mph gusts and 80 with 100% humidity and fog.Also lots of pot holes.It can be heard while mowing a lawn. I back out of my garage through toddlers, back out of work through a blind alley (I'm  a librarian) and live in a subdivision with lots of mowing, leaf blowing, edging and weed wacking going on. They make a louder one but this was heard by someone in a sealed house with Pella windows and their AC on. Lol!Oh, it is the stereotypical beep of a big truck backing up. Just like UPS and garbage trucks have-the cheaper units chirp like a bird which is stupid. Neighbors think a delivery or utility truck has arrived.Ps. my cargo hooks in the pics were two for ten at Menards...so I got four :)-mike from Detroit

I used this to remove rust from old "O" scale train tracks and it worked perfectly. I soaked the tracks for 24hrs and they came out with no rust, theyy look like new. I saw this product on a car show and thought I would give it a try. I am gald I did and I will buy it again. I have attached before and after pictures.

I Had ReadyLift installed on my 2015 Silverado. 2.25" front lift 66-3085 and removed the factory 1.25" rear blocks to install ReadyLift 3" rear blocks 66-3003. Also added the ReadyLift rear 1.5" Shock extensions 67-3809 to maintain the factory ride. Then a 4-Wheel Alignment. Also replaced my CURT 45030 Class 3, 2" drop ball mount with a CURT 45050 Class 3, 4" drop ball mount to keep trailer level. Attached pics with new height.

The three stars really should 5 but here's why. The dimensions they give supposedly come really close to the original power wheels battery. Negative, minus one star. (Don't pay attention to the other wires in the picture. That's the LED light bar loom) There are claims of more speed with these batteries. Negative, minus one more star. Now the plus side. They do seem to hold their amp draw better than the original batteries (if you can get it to fit your vehicle). I've noticed my son's F150 climbed up the hill in our backyard which has 3/4 gravel all the way up to the top. Also, our side driveway that is concrete but steep. The original batteries would tend to slow or even quit before the summit. It could be due to them reaching their life cycle but nevertheless, these new batteries seem to do the trick with longer run time for a fraction of the price. All if you can use them in your application so really pay attention to fitment.

Ordered this simply out of curiosity and love it. My wheels look better than when I got the car brand new and beads water nicely. The product goes on super easy and wipes off even easier. I applied mostly by hand to get into the hard areas and used an applicator to spread it out on the flat bits. It's not harsh on your hand but does make it turn green (as shown) nothing a dish soap scrubbing won't remove tho. Smells nice which is a plus and a little goes a very long way, I did 2 cars, 18" and 17" rims respectively and barely made a dent into the tub of product. I can safely say I'll have this for a couple years. Looking forward to see how it performs with the brake dust. Although to be honest I don't expect great durability given the nature of wheels and brakes but it's so easy to use I won't mind if I have to reapply every couple months.Wheels were cleaned with Sonax Wheel Cleaner Full Effect and clayed before application of max coat. Will update on ease of cleaning and durability later on.UPDATE 10.09.2016My cars haven't been washed in a month thanks to the busy schedule of being a working grad student. Therefore the max coat was unintentionally put to the test. A month of brake dust on my daily driver truck and a few drives on my Mercedes which is a brake dust machine. Wheels on both vehicles were cleaned by ONLY a jet from my pressure washer and all the brake dust came right off. I'd say the wheels are 85% clean. They would sparkle 100% with one pass of a mitt or wheel brush I'm sure, but 3 minutes to clean 4 wheels is beyond great in my opinion. I will give them a scrubbing next wash but my rims are clean with just a pressure washer which makes life so much easier for those quick weekend washes in busy times. I now have clean wheels for another few weeks with minimal effort. LOVE THIS PRODUCT.

The crimps to hold the wires are a joke. Could pull them out with little effort. I ended up soldering #1 welding wire  to the copper teeth part. If you press the wire in the channel it fits with no wiggle room. Jaws apply a good amount of pressure.

It's a nice made tool. On stainless I expanded 2.5 in to make a bell end.  First heated with mapp gas and greased everything like crazy then used an impact.  They do not include enough grease even for the first use.  First try I wanted to expand adaptors holding them with a channel lock, no go.  The tooth marks created weak spots which were exploited by the stretcher as you see.  The workpiece must be fastened to something, vehicle,  muffler, etc.  By the way, don't use this vertically, the wedges or whole tool can get lost when they fall.  I had a close call with my muffler.The shims are held together with o rings.  All the prices were jumbled around in the case.  The o rings are recessed so they don't melt if pipe is heated.All in all I'm an avid diyer but between fooling with this and a terrible stainless mig weld job wish I just took to an exhaust shop.

I received the Load Control and it was exactly as it was described. After opening the boxes and doing an inventory, (all items were there along with a few extras in case I buggered up in the Install). It took a couple of hours to install due to finding places to mount the compressor and dash guage. The air lines and wiring were partially preassembled and that was a breeze to install. Once the 5/8 hole was drilled in the fire wall to accomidate the pass through air and electric line. The kit has plenty of air line so it was neccassary to cut to fit my application. For an overall I was greatly pleased with how easy it was to install and hookup. the paper instructions were very good and of coarse the pictures were fantastic for following the wiring diagrams.

This is a great winch. No need to break the bank with name recognition. Installed this on an 08 JKU Wrangler and is great. The build quality is excellent, very simple to install and the wireless function is a must. There are 2 criticisms that stopped it.originally from being 5 stares.  One is nit picky, the range of the wireless. The manual states max of 50meters, even after replacing with a brand new quality battery the max distance clear line of sight is only 50 to 60 feet. Not a show stopper by any means but since the manual stated value and it only comes in at a third if it....The real reason for the lack of 5 stars is the solenoid mounting. It comes with the brackets which look great to mount over the spool. Didnt want that so mounted in the alternate location over the motor. A redesign is needed here as there are only 2 screws holding it on and are both on the side of the spool. This means other side of the box flops up n down. Very disappointed in this design as everything else is well thought out. I ended up using adhesive spacers in-between the motor housing and bottom of solenoid to make level and reduce movement. Shouldn't need to on a brand new product.The winch is strong, cut down a tree using the winch to pull a tree - a widowmaker that was left behind after a storm and used it to drag it up a hillOnly one finger is needed to hold onto the cable to walk it out in free spool, was as a nice surprise. Remote feels great in hand and has a soft rubber texture.Update 12/17/2015Have used this winch now extensively every weekend since I installed it. Have done 10 very heavy pulls , near stall of single line capacity with no issues. Unit does get quite warm but stopped short of any thermal cutoff. Free spool is almost too smooth as there is no apparent resistance which allows birdcaging if tightly spooled cable is hand pulled without the drum brakingUpdate 7/23/15This winch has proved itself and earned the 5th star. 17 heavy pulls with half of the nearing stall point but never did. 5 pulls using double line and 20k snatch block to skid a 60 foot long maple yree about 15 inch diameter while dighing in the ground a bit. Winch has oerformed eveytime. The safety catch latch on the originally supplied hook busted but that is due to its design and would happen  no matter what brand. Going to be upgrading to a much better hook with a different locking design.2/7/16 updateExcellent winch , love it completely. Did replace the hook with a heavy TMJ self locking hook which was a great addition. Nothing wrong with the crossbar support on this winch, need to take care to not abuse it allowing cable to pile up in one area that will exceed the clearances. Any damage is a usage problem not a product problem, even though Smittybilt is kind enough to replace.added photo with upgraded hook.3/18/16 final update. Unreal winch, has pulled some intense loads without fail. Even tested after freezing rain and a foot of snow the night before. Brushed just enough snow off to turn on the wireless switch.  I thought this would be the ultimate test of CA winch left uncovered. The steel cable was frozen hard in ice but this winch worked great. If I ever needed another I would buy again2/27/17 update after the wireless function stopped working. Smittybilt customer service was great, found the on off switch in solenoid failed. They were quick to replace but I chose a real waterproof boot sealed switch from Amazon myself, added phoyos. Plug in the part number on the package and use that instead if the current factory replacement. Provided their engineers with that info and they will look at it. Hopefully offer this surfy as a warranted replacement and even come with it instead. Still loving the winch have pulled countless trees felling and oncedown dragging around.

I bought the H4 Led style.  It does come with the extra connectors for the H4 so no need to worry yourself.  Installation is very easy.  It's simply a plug and play motion.  It's brighter than your normal HID and gives a nicer white light.  The only issue to some ppl is the fan noise for the lights but it's nothing to shout about.  By the time your engine is running your won't hear a thing.  Best product.  Would recommend!

I used these to replace some convex lens LEDs that were being used as reverse lights in a 2013 Kia Rio5. They are perfect, much brighter and safer. Unlike the LEDs that these replaced, you get bright light from basically all angles, which is important in reverse lights. I'd imagine these would be overkill and/or too big for some applications such as license plate lights.

I wanted to mount these as a way for other drivers on and off road to be able to see me in all kinds of conditions. I have mounted lights above the hood by the side mirrors before on jeeps, with the older style 4 or 5 inch round lights you send up with a lot of spill either onto the hood or cross glare from the edge of the light. It's just due to the location of light mounts on jeeps, etc. These are so small and easy to mount I was able to mount them between the pillars of my side mirrors of my truck. Worked great. Was super east to wire and the LED can bee seen from very far away. I didn't intend these as a aux light source, but even then they are pretty bright for being a single 10watt LED Over all considering the price and light I am impressed. The only downside and it't not a flaw in the product is the added wind noise at that location when the windows are down. Can't go wrong buying these IMO.

I have been using this product for a year now and I am a believer.  Beside using it on my vehicles, I have used it on my boyfriends boat that really brought out the blue color in the boat seats and dash.  Then I used it on a used jet ski and again, people was amazed of how it restored it back to life. I have even restored back faded garage doors with this product. The picture just shows me doing one half of the door so you can see the before and after. People thought I painted the garage doors when I got done.  I have recommend it to others and its a must if you like detailing a vehicles, boats and more and keeping them looking them nice and preserving it. It will not be a shiny look, but you are restoring the colors back to that it use to be.  You will find many uses for it.

This is the pair to buy!  I tried a lesser brand and the jaws were dull and horrible.  Don't be fooled by the imitators!  The CV pliers by Lisle are legit.  The grind on the jaws is superb and the center hammer comes down evenly.  It's a few more dollars for this tool, but well worth it!

Absolutely an awesome deal and quality bars (I worried that they would be cheap and flimsy)..  They're not.  I wouldn't have known that they weren't the OEM factory Toyota bars.  Stupid-easy to install.  4 bolts. Comes with all necessary tools.  The only thing to note, I have an LIMITED, is that they appear to be too short when you first put them up top..  **you must unscrew the two hex bolts on the bottom and extend the bars to the furthest spot out (about 1").  Pop the post covers on and you're down the road!

In all fairness to the product I really didn't expect much. I had a finish that I thought was pretty near, if not at, maximum. But I was pleasantly surprised. Sure it makes the slippery surface even more so. And as I started working I noticed the car did look a little brighter. But about halfway through I really started to notice that the metal flake was brighter than ever. I have Platinum Metallic Tri-Coat on a 16 SHO and I have never seen it sparkle as much. One other surprise was there was a small spot on the rear spoiler that I had never been able get out. I started calling it her birth mark. But it wiped right off. It also made the painted rims look great as well. The full car shot was before the sun came out so it doesnt accentuate the flake as much. But you can see on the hood the wet looking shine. Ill definitely add it to my regular routine.

What I received was NOT what was pictured. Honestly it was better. (See pictures)I used this on my 2015 RAM 1500 before I traded it in. The applicator is akin to fingernail polish brush and the clear coat is included on the other end. (Differnt brush) The paint was a PERFECT match to PRP ( you will find your exact color cold on the inside of the driver door next to the VIN sticker.)

The packaging was like everyone said; it was in a box that did not fit right, but mine showed up with all the parts and no damage. It bolted right up to the frame bolt holes on my 09 Rav4 with no problem. As stated in another review the bolt by the muffler was a little difficult to get to, but I had it on in about 10 minutes this included looking for the wrenches. For the money I would order from them again even if it did show up with a couple of scratches. The delivery time was fast too.

Bought for my KTM 1190. A little snug going in, ended up disassembling turn signal housing to install. Not a big deal. Fantastic upgrade. They are a million times brighter than the stock turns and they do not throw fault codes. One of the best upgrades you can do to your bike, in my opinion. Just buy them!

Handy solution for mounting rocker switches in a Jeep TJ.  It may be just me, but I didn't realize that this only replaces one of the two center vents.  So with two of these, you could mount 4 switches.  I only needed two switches so it worked out great. You will need to cut these.  I used an exacto knife and scored the existing rectangle on the back.  Once I removed the rectangular section I still had to shave the opening to get my switches to fit.  Once they go in, they are never coming out with pretty much destroying the pod.  Overall, a slick and inexpensive solution for mounting a pair of rocker switches. I recommend this product.

There's no way I could've installed this top without the help of my dad and his friend. That said, it looks great. I loved it when I lived in Vegas, but since then, i've moved to the PNW and the rain has proven several places along the back of the vehicle that are not sealed completely. There are several places where the back glass meets the trunk wall that isn't sealed properly. I'm looking for something to fix this issue and in the meantime I'm driving around with a towel in the trunk to soak up the excess water that puddles in my car. I've included a picture with the light shining through the trunk to display the gaps.

I bought this cover to protect my moped from the sun.  The material is lightweight and sheer, protecting it from both sunlight and rain. This cover has two plastic rivets at both sides of the bottom to secure to your bike/moped from below; a must have if there are strong winds blowing in your area.  My cover sees partial sunlight in the afternoon hours and has held up well on the top surfaces.  I've used mine for several months now, and have noticed some slight tearing at the bottom near my exhaust pipe where it has rubbed repeatedly against the metal frame of my bike, but I do have some strong winds that whip through my property on a nightly basis and I think the damage my cover has seen is not typical.Overall a decent investment.

I just bought a car with a rebuilt transmission and all I could think of  is, what product would help protect my new transmission???....yes it's a product that I have used with all my vehicles... "Prolong Transmission Treatment"....not only will it protect from all the moving parts inside your transmission, it will reduce friction which causes heat and your transmission does not like heat....this product will protect against "friction and heat".It will make your transmission run smoother and promotes easy shifting throughout the shifting of gears...this product is compatible with all common transmission fluids and gear oils and can be used in new and high mileage cars...and what I like to see, "made in the USA"....and while your at it, try there "Prolong Engine Treatment".. I just changed my oil and I added a bottle of this so I can "be protected" both "engine and transmission"...

I ride in dusty areas, so these fitted mats are a must.  Great fit, but for the price I was expecting something more "durable."  So, I spent an extra $15 and bought a can of rubber spray and truck bed liner spray.  I sprayed the back with the rubber spray and put two coats of truck bed liner spray on the inside.  I believe it will add life to the mats.

These switches are great replacements for the ones previously in my shop. They seem made well and they positively lock in either position.That said I will warn anybody reading this not to be dumb like me and take the switch housing apart. I wanted to see how it worked and how well it was made. So my intentions were good anyway. Inside there are two 5/32 (I believe) ball bearings that detent into grooves keeping the switch in either position. Said ball bearings are tiny and very easily lost hence my warning.Others have complained about needing a deep box, but mine fit okay in regular PVC surface mount boxes. I don't care for the lack of ability to ground the switch using a plastic box but the switch is all plastic anyway. I did use some weatherproof box gaskets behind the switches as the cover was a little small in my opinion for the boxes I used but that's not a big deal may be an issue unique to my situation.I have several more tools I may convert to these switches just because I like them so much.

Purchased for my 1993 Mazda RX-7 (FD3S). I purchased the size that says it is good for "up to 170-inches" since my car is exactly 169-inches.The quality of the cover is excellent, but the size is not long enough -- it will not fully cover both the front and rear bumpers.I am returning the cover for the next size up, but I am worried it may be a loose fitting so I will likely add additional straps.

I installed these in a Ford Fiesta ST and the light they emit looks really great.Very easy to install in tight headlights that do not have enough space for fans/heatsinks.These work well, stay very cool, and have a scatter pattern identical to OEM halogen - but these are much much brighter. The bulbs I received had a color temperature of 6000k.There are nearly identical, higher quality units with Phillips LED (instead of CREE) chips available on Xenon Depot, but they are ~50% more. My recommendation is to get these.I did try using these in my fog light housing, but would recommend against it because they do not have a projector lens on the end of the bulb. If you have projector fog housings, I think you would be fine - but if you have reflector housings, then the light doesn't seem to get very far down the road.

Great deal only $135.00!!! Been in the truck (1996 F350 manual) for about 2 weeks. Can tell an obvious increase in power haven't seen much of a change in fuel economy getting between 15-18mpg depending on how I drive. Install was super easy. Will report back when I install a cold air intake.

Worked beautifully on my 04 Silverado 1500 Z71. Very easy to replace. Remember, let tailgate half way down and pull up on passenger side of it and it comes right out. After that 4 bolts per side and you're back in the game. Mine had rusted out pretty good. Feels like a solid gate again.

I've always heard that Spyder is one of the cheaper brands, and they are. However I've had these lights on my truck for 2 years and they haven't yellowed, dulled, and I haven't had a single LED burn out. I am very happy with how these look and how long they've lasted. The photo was taken today, not when I bought them.

Installed with provided parts in < 30 minutes on my 2003 Road King.  Love the look of the blacked out headlights on my black bike. Only mod was to cut wires and crimp on male blade connectors for the running lights to plug into the OEM connectors.

Easy to install on my 2013 Honda Civic 4D Sedan.Very bright. Actually, maybe a little too bright.The picture doesn't even compare to seeing it in person.I also have LED day running lights so, when I put my high beams on, it's insanely bright.Just what I wanted though.

Awesome foot well light kit!!  While I could have installed myself do to simplicity of the kit I instead paid a small price for a professional to do it and also have a switch utilized as well. The install came out beautiful!! Had it hooked up to my door so when and if a door is open it's always on. Definitely recommend having a switch under the dash installed out of sight like I did so if by some chance you get tired of seeing the lights you can turn them off while driving at any time. The LEDs and colors are bright and vibrant! Although it did not have a very dark purple setting which I wanted it ended up matching my pink purple LEDs in my car perfectly. The sound setting works very well and vibed to every beat I through at it. The controller is simple and easy to use and key chain controller is a cool addition and blows people minds! The adhesive on the strips was very strong and had no problem sticking to the surfaces under my dash and seats. Adds a cool factor to any car interior definitely recommend.

H13 direct replacement...I have 20 years connector experience (Molex/Deutsch, Hirose etc) and I am confident in my opinion that it is very close to H13 but not operationally close- in a mechanical interconnect function.Mating cycle goes smooth to about 65/70% but does not latch, does not make electrical contact to turn lights on.Visually both Sylvania it is replacing, and Quantum look almost identical, except the "triangle" that is critical to latch (ensures electrical connection and that bulb stays attached) it looks like the "triangle" is about 1-2 mm to large to allow positive latching..Can I modify it? sure but then its not returnable, so based on what I make an hour, estimate 1-3 hours work to get it "fixed", I these bulbs will cost me about $400.00

Researched several options for a replacement AM/FM antenna for my '16 Wrangler JK and I am happy with this choice. First the base of the antenna unscrews in to three pieces (1) the mast (2) the base screw that screws into the stock antenna mount (3) and the black adapter that connects item #2 to the antenna mast item #1. This allows you to assemble everything together tightly so none of the threads are showing as with some that I have seen. Ensure you get everything assembles with sufficient thread engagement and make it tight.There is a manufactured curve to the antenna mast. Not really sure of the purpose of this curve but I oriented it so that the curve faced the fender...dealers choice on this because no direction as to why a curve was required and looked more aesthetically pleasing that way...As you probably are aware, there will be some degradation in reception with this stubby antenna versus the stock 26' metal antenna.  However, I have not detected an appreciable degradation of my AM/FM reception yet, at least locally. In addition, as you know, this will not affect your satellite radio or navigation as these use a separate special antenna mounted on the roll-bar under the padding on the passenger side of the vehicle.

The directions for this are excellent follow them carefully! I included a photo so you can see the difference between your old F150 differential cap and this new one. This fit my 2006 F150 absolutely perfect. Getting the Old stock cap off Was more difficult than I thought. I used a paint scraper and a hammer to get in between the facing and the cap. You have to be very careful not to gouge the facing!  You will likely need to get your truck up on blocks in order to have leverage to get the cap off. I had to get mine off the ground 4". I used amsoil product for the higher heat ratio.

I bought this to mount on my 2015 Alluma 4X8 utility trailer,  gonna mount this to the tongue right in front of the front panel so I can store all my Ratcheting Straps inside plus what ever I need to carry.It's plenty big enough for what I need it for.I'm gong mount it with 4 stainless steel nuts and bolts so they won't rust.I like how it locks to keep my stuff secure and safe.So having an all aluminum trailer a diamond plate box and stainless steel nut's and bolts I won't have to replace anything.

This is a reat place to store your soft-top windows for your Jeep Wrangler. I have a 2014 premium OEM soft top. Look at my pics, and you'll see I used a floaty tube to keep the windows from getting crushed. It sits on top of the folded soft top, strapped to the roll cage. Very tidy. DON'T roll your rear window up and hang it from the loops inside your OEM soft-top. It will get scratched and disfigured.

Easy install on a 2015 Chrysler Town & Country.  The original bulbs at 18 months old, while not bad, seemed a little yellow so I was looking for an inexpensive replacement.  This X-tremeVision seemed to fit the bill, not blue and rated - albeit by the MFG - brighter with a longer reach which is what I was after.  They are also rated at 3400 degrees which I believe is just a smidge whiter than stock.  When I pulled the stock bulbs it turns out they are Phillips, the connecter type/model only says 'H11' on the original bulbs but on the new bulbs it says 'H11 C'.  I'm guessing they are just a super long life bulb but at 3000 degrees and less efficient.  For comparison I've added a photo - the light on the left (looking at the photo) is the X-tremeVision, the bulb on the right is the original equipment bulb (now 18 months old from the date of MFG derived from the vehicle sticker)  The blueish light is from a 300 lumen LED flashlight.

Seems to help, but the holes for U bolt aren't wide enough, so it's easy for the bolt to hit the plate while tightening it and keeping nut from tightening all the way. Other than that it seems to work pretty well, very solid!

This is a great tool. I just used it to replace the valves on my Suzuki LTZ400. The body of the tool seems solid enough to handle any job I will be throwing at it, and it was able to compress the springs without any noticeable bending or deflection. My one complaint is that this kit does not come with any round head to sit in the center of the valve face. Sure you can use one of the smaller cups that comes with it, but they are pretty sharp and could scratch the combustion chamber of the head or the valve. I ended up making a rounded plastic piece on my lathe out of delrin which slid right over the screw head and sat beautifully in the valve face. It wouldn't cost more than a nickle to have these mass made in China, so hopefully in the future they will start including something similar since that really is the only difference between this kit and one costing twice as much.

This stuff is amazing. I did not use a buffer and did the application by hand so it did require a bit of elbow grease but the results speak for themself.  I used this the remove almost 17 years of oxidation on a '99 Chaparral I just bought to restore it to almost 'like new' condition.

These are nice trim pieces which made the install of Seadog marine rocker switches on my golf cart a complete look. I installed them under the ball holder where the warning label was and it was an exact fit. So if this is your intended use be sure measure twice, the height was exact.

Nice shine, but I can't say I love it. It leaves streaks and requires more passes with the microfiber to buff off, compared to other products I use. The sprayer puts out a lot of product so be prepared for that. I did one half of my hood and moved to the other half and ended up having to do the first half again because there was so much over spray. I would be cautious using this on a black car because I know how streaky black paint can be. I would not like this at all if I still had my black car. I haven't tested it's hydrophobic qualities yet but I can say the paint is super slick to the touch, even more than it was, and it was pretty slick. This is a brand new car with only 400 miles on it and it's been waxed and sealed. I also use products like this on my rims because it causes any dirt to just slide right off with your microfiber. You can just wipe off brake dust. It won't even stick as long as you have a good clear coat. It's also good for exterior trim and glass. It just streaks a bit too much. I don't like having to go over my car with a chamois afterwards and if I don't I'll find streaks or patches of dried product because of all the overspray here and there when I'm just walking around the car. In the picture with the streaks that was after three passes with my microfiber cloth and you can see there was still a lot more wiping I would have to do to get all that product off. Every pass of your cloth is a chance to make scratches so I don't like products that require a lot of wiping. Maybe if they adjusted the sprayer to release less product that would help but even when I am careful to not pull the full squeeze and release a smaller amount of product, even that smaller amount needs more wiping than Meguiars or Griott's. But back to that shine---it could be my imagination but I think it's a little shinier. The picture of the passenger side of the car is before Mother's and then the picture of the driver side is after Mother's.

Ordered this after reading where one guy could not get it to fit a 2015 Ram 1500. Don't think he had any ideal how to install it. As it was mounted and ready to use in less then 10 minutes. Installed on a 2015 Ram 1500 with factory spray in bed liner.Got this for my wife, She fell out of the bed of her Work Truck. Could have been bad, and almost was. So ordered this for her Company truck. Now the company is getting them for all there trucks. This great priced item, easy to install. Could save any of us from a broken Hip. Broken leg, arm. Or even from Death.For Company's out there. This could save you a Workmans Comp Claim. Down time for a worker, or you being short handed from a fall.

I'm not 100% happy with it because I feel it could be brighter. It's not really that bright at all I would say it's a tad bit dimmer than factory. You can tell its lit up for sure looking right at it, it doesn't cast a lot of light like the factory and from the side looks extremely dim. I also added the sho-me led flasher to it which gives a nice touch and is an eye grabber at night. Other than that it looks great my whole JK is murdered out now inside and out!

I bought these cupholders for a side table I was making to go next to our couch in the basement. One reviewer said he cut a 3.5" hole, another said 3.75". I wanted to err on the side of caution, so I cut a 3.5" hole with my Jasper circle cutting router jig while waiting for these to arrive. Upon arrival I noticed that they were too large for the holes I'd cut (yeah I probably should've waited). After enlarging the hole with a jigsaw, I measured the inner diameters of my cuts as being between 3.6875" (3 11/16") and 3.75" (3 3/4"). The lip covers the hole edge on the 3.75", so for anyone else interested I recommend making a 3.75" hole for best fit. The other hole fit, but was much tighter to get in.As for the cupholders themselves, they're somewhat thick molded plastic. The lips and interior was smooth, and it sits flush in the hole fine. The cupholders fit nearly all my beverages, at least all the ones that are 'reasonable'. See attached photos for some examples of what I had handy. I'm not planning to use the drain hole, so I filed it down and filled with a squirt of hot glue. The two tiers are a nice compromise for a wide variety of containers.Overall, great cupholders. The only thing I could even think to improve on would be a template for tracing the hole size on what you're attempting to cut into, but that's a minor quibble for sure. Use a 3.75" hole saw or router template and enjoy!

Awsome product, I am very happy with how it looks on my truck. It lights up when my headlights turn on automatically, and it brightens up more when I depress the brakes. I also like that its huge, a lot of products like these are small and virtually unnoticeable but this one you will definitely see.. note: you will need to purchase an extension cable. Which was only $5.00 . I highly recommend this product..

Fits perfectly on my 2007 Dodge Nitro.  Each bar even has the word "Nitro " on them.  Did not need to use the steel channels since my existing side rails already had them.Looks just the the OEM ones and placed a rack on the with no problems.  Make sure you are aware that the back end is wider than the front, so before screwing them into place that they are evenly spaced side to side.

Same tail bag as the Cortech Sport tailbag. I had a Cortech tailbag that wore out after several years. Cortech stop making them so I have been looking for a replacement for a couple of years. The MotoCentric Mototrek Sport Tail Bag seemed to be the same also but at a higher price point. I just received this tailbag and its pretty much the same as the original Cortech that I had. Quality seems to be about the same and am very pleased with the price at Amazon. Fits great on V-Strom's and expands when needed.Good job Amazon for carrying this product at a good price!

I own a 2016 Honda Civic and these lights do the job nicely. The LEDs are brighter than stock but honestly not so much that it makes a big difference in lumens. It all boils down to color preference, yellow or white. And I prefer yellow, but don't let brightness be the determining factor for your purchase.**In the 1st picture the LEDs are in the front and the stock bulbs are in the rear seat just for reference.

It fit my Pioneer x731bt well, but read the instructions carefully; for a specific year-range Spectra, you are directed to another page for "final assembly" and are instructed to NOT actually screw the kit to the car; instead, it relies on the spring-tab trim piece to hold it in.  Once installed, everything looks decent, and works fine, but I'm not thrilled about the fact that it isn't actually screwed into the car, the way the factory unit (and every other after-market kit) typically is.To be clear, the tabs line up perfectly with the stock threaded holes in the dash-frame, but if you use those tabs and the stock holes, then the trim piece doesn't fit back into place over the radio.  That's what had me confused initially.The bracket can be easily modified to use (some of) the stock bolt holes if desired.

Got this PCV Valve along with Grommet along for my 1999 Lexus RX300.  The old valve grommet was brittle and I was able remove it using "TEKTON 5873 Door Panel Remover " that I had bought from Amazon.  The old PCV valve was clogged up (shake it and listen, should hear a rattle, if not it's clogged).  After replacing the grommet and PCV valve, took the vehicle for a drive, and felt smooth and steady acceleration with no hesitation.Grommet used:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dorman-HELP-42058-PCV-Valve-Grommet/dp/B000CO91HM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dorman HELP! 42058 PCV Valve Grommet</a>If you are planning to replace PCV valve, go ahead and order the grommet as well.

Stong Contender for Recovery.After reading lots of reviews and talking to members of our 4x4 off road club, the Smittybilt Winch is the way I went. The newer IP68 waterproof rating and 'outside drum' braking for cooler operation with synthetic rope was worth the extra expense in my opinion. First, 3/8" synthetic rope versus steel cable is 30 pounds lighter on the front of the vehicle, easier to handle and less prone to hand injuries than steel. If you should have a recovery line break in the field, you can repair the synthetic with a simple FID but not the steel cable. Changing connections from hooks to a closed recovery system (FACTOR-55), its easy with synthetic rope. Synthetic rope is very strong and even takes effort to cut with a razor blade against a wooden block. The winch is quiet in operation and recovery speed is pretty good (review specs). The remote control is a nice feature to move around freely without the limit of a 12' cable connected and has a good working range from the winch. This allows you to secure your connections at the recovery point and 'bump' the winch IN and make sure straps and D-Rings are straight before pulling hard for recovery. Several purchasers have had problems with the remote control and I was one of them. When pressing the ON switch on the remote, the LED light didn't illuminate; was it a dead 12v battery or something else? Upon opening inspection, the 12v battery tray inside the remote had failed and one end was not making contact with the battery. Squeezing the battery tray ends together around the battery allowed the remote to function properly. Therefore, I contacted Smittybilt via phone and then send photos of what I found. There was no question the unit had a problem and Smittybilt representative processed an order for a replacement to be sent out which I received the next day...is that service or what! Each remote is 'paired' like a smart phone to an earpiece so changing out the 'receiver' under the controller cover was necessary and simple. Pre-tensioned the synthetic rope with approx 1000 pounds on the spool and now ready if a self recovery is necessary or help a person in distress! My application is a Jeep TJ weighting in at 4000 pounds loaded on the scales and could have purchased a smaller unit with 5/16" cable; my thoughts were, less strain on a 10K winch with 3/8" recovery line. I am glad I made this purchase even if used very little but its there when needed. Tread Lightly my Friends!

Bought generic ones off eBay when I bought my lift/leveling kit for my 2011 Nissan Frontier and being cheap didn't workout.Guy at my tire shop recommended these to get a better alignment. These came in 2 days, these are MUCH better quality,  took an hour or so to swap out, alignment done and the front tires now look align and the numbers on the alignment read out are WAY better.If you are are doing a front lift/leveling kit these are the bolts!You will need two kits, one for each side.

These filters fit perfectly on my Chrysler Town & Country 2012 with PentaStar 3.6L engine - the manufacturing is top notch. I have used this filter a few times over a year + and I find no issues to report. I use fully synthetic oil but you can use any kind of engine oil for this filter. The price as sold at Amazon is quite affordable which makes it even more appealing. Also, the box says "Made in Poland", not China...which is yet another positive to note for some. Highly recommended.** Update, now these are "assembled" in the USA, according to latest labeling.

Wow! When I read the reviews and description for credit card size, they were right! It's about the size of a palm size cut steak or a small chicken breast. I thought it'd be too bulky to mount in my car's passenger area, but it seems I can conceal it pretty well. I'll add the fifth star when I use it, I'm pretty sure I'll love it!One concern, this miniature dynamo blew a fuse in my car when we plugged in a travel hair curler. I'm going to need to revamp my electrical system on the road.

I purchased these and another set of adapters from this same vendor via Amazon for a 2016 Jeep Wrangler for this installation of some aftermarket fog lights.  Neither set I ordered are are PSX24W COMPATIBLE as advertised.  All of the research that I found show that these are H16/PS24WFF/9009/5202 compatible but not PSX24W.  The description is inaccurate and the pictures are not detailed enough to tell.  I have notified the appropriate individuals and hopefully they will correct their description.  I have included a photo of what I received.The product does appear to be good quality and had it worked for my application, I would have rated this 5 stars.

This is a great addition to the Jeep Wrangler 4 door.Product Quality: The fit is good and overall quality is extremely sturdy.  The spider balls work well and after having this installed for the last several months I have seen no issues with the elastic failing or stress on any of the grommets or shade material.Use:  When driving with the top back it seemed that the sun was always shining directly in your eyes.  The real nice part about having this Spidershade is that you still get the feel of having the top back, but with out the direct sunlight.  When parked it is really nice knowing that the interior is not getting baked by the sun!  Additionally, there is a noticeable positive difference in wind decrease in the cabin as well. This seems to be very favorable for the wife and teenage daughter who both have long hair.Installation:  I originally installed this with the soft top in the retractable mode (half back) and not all the way back (with windows out).  By doing this I found that I was not able to pull the Spidershade back far enough and there was a little slack in the tightness up front by the windshield mounts.  I would highly recommend that you put the top all the way back and then install the Spidershade (which is the recommended way).  This will make it much easier to install and will help ensure that you have it pulled over the rear roll bar as it should.  I leave this on all the time, soft top up or off and find it has no interference in the cabin (6' 3" and my head/hair does not touch the shade ). Note - you do have to remove the left and right windshield mount Spiderballs to secure the soft top latches (center mount always attached), which is only a minor inconvenience.  [...]Overall - great quality product, very easy 5 minute or less install that adds some additional driving comfort to the Jeep Wrangler.[...] Thanks! :)

I bought these for my 2006 sedona rear brakes, but they wouldn't fit. The weren't cut the same as the original pads, and the tab on the side was too wide to fit into the clips or calipers. I even went to my local Oreilly's to compare them to the Wagner QC954 off their shelf, and I confirmed they are the same, but wouldn't fit. I showed them the original pad and they didn't know what to think, other than obviously they weren't going to fit. I ended up buying some $40 "BrakeBest" ceramic pads they had in stock, after I confirmed they were cut the same as the old ones I brought in. I can't speak to the front brakes, but the rears wouldn't fit and makes me doubt Wagner's specs, at least for Kia.I contacted Wagner via WagnerBrakes website to inform them of the discrepency.  Other than fitment issue, they looked like a quality pad.  I added to pics here to demonstrate the problem.

Worked great to replace the worn out actuator. I did have to cut off the old passlock switch and superglue it on this unit... Only downside is I had to cut the factory wires and switch them around, when I first installed, it would unlock when pressing the lock. Still saved me $100+

I live in Washington State, the roads are really bad, rocks chip windshields left and right, from motorists who don't have mud flaps.At first, I didn't think this would work but..........Let me show you with images, and no I am not being paid by anyone to do this. I stand by a product when it works. Here are the images from beginning to end. Took 3 times, make sure that you find the pin hole of the crack.My case was "bullseye" effect.

Decent product. Didn't have a very adhesive backing so I had to get creative. Three lights out of the strip were flickering initially after installation but they seem to have stabilized. The strip had a black and red wire on both sides which was convenient. Only test now is to see how long they last.

For the price, I was expecting a bit better construction. The battery cover is like any other remote control covers, but more difficult to open and close with the battery in it. The plastic cover feels thin and surfaces are rough which may contribute to the difficulty in its operation. It leaves a small gap after its closed, so forget about water resistance. The amount of sparks generated is adequate for normal gas stoves, but more sparks would be better. The tip area has three opened slots for the sparks; with the small sparks, it could use more opened slots. The led light is a nice touch, but it only works when you start the sparks. It could be improved by having a delay shut off. The light on mine came misaligned.  Overall, it does the job, hopefully, this one will last longer 15 butane gas lighters from 99 stores.

Installed on 2015 Ram 2500 w/ 6.7 Cummins. Easily the most difficult and time consuming intake I have ever installed. Took about 2 hours, part of the issue is the height of the truck. Instructions are very elaborate and easy to read. Pictures were great also. Looks and sounds great. Turbo is easily heard.

I ordered this because of the reviews, company was very fast with response to my request . the switch lights up and stays on, I see a few reviews about it staying on but it doesn't kill my battery . product is sturdy and looks like a factory item. Mictuning company has a standard of quality and does a great job of meeting that standard. So to wrap up this review in a few words, great looking,high quality product. First company that cares about the quality and customer satisfaction

Great car floor mats!Got these for a Patriot Blue 2000 Jeep XJ. I changed all the interior bulbs to blue LED's so I started to look for blue floor mats. These were at the top of the search. And I knew that these would be perfect. They look amazing under the super bright front courtesy lights which are just above them. Check the pics. Looks so much better in person.

This cooler comes with everything thing you will need to make a custom install. I got this cooler to replace my stock cooler on my 99 GMC Sierra. My trans temp used to get up to 210 deg in traffic now the highest it has been is 185 deg. Big difference. It was easy to install took about an hour. As you can see in the photo it is much larger than the stock cooler.

I would love to give this a 5 star, but I have a strange feeling the edges will fail at some point.  Seemed to have issues sticking on edges and tight bends.  I'm not sure if this is pressure or heat sensitive in terms of how it sticks to surfaces.  It looks beautiful and was in prestien condition upon arrival.  Didn't have any issues with bubbles or cutting, given the thickness of the material.  I tried to cold stretch when possible, but heat seemed to be the pushing factor for complex curves.  Luckily, most of the edges I think will fail at tucked under door and dash trim and will hopefully stay put for a while, until I decide to change it again.  For the price and how it looks, I would say...why not risk it!

Overall a very powerful and impressive light. Mounting hardware is included and is damn good for holding the light in the proper position. All LEDs seems to provide an even illumination and brightness.It does take up quite a bit of space when mounted so it disheveled my original idea to mount it to my roof rack (too tall and too much wind resistance). So I will save it and purchase another to dual-mount to my bumper.The "flood" beam isn't as "flood" as I would prefer, but I have yet to find a light that is truly as flood as I want. Overall a solid light that is good for the money. Works perfectly on 13.9V DC (standard vehicle operating voltage)I received a discount for my honest review

I ordered 2 sets of these for dom lights in my w210 1999 mercedes e320. They are error free from a canbus standpoint. They are without a doubt 8000k temperature. Too much blue hue for my taste. One of the LEDs burnt out in less than a week! But 7/8 still work, so I can use the bulb. Not overly bright. Oversized envelope for 2 little bulbs. Over all they do the job, but not impressed

I used this on a 2 year old leather sectional couch I hadn't done anything to, other than wipe off dust with a damp terry cloth towel.I applied to the areas receiving wear, although not showing any signs of wear yet, due to high quality leather, as well as the rear & side facing areas, which don't receive any wear.  I haven't noticed any discoloration whatsoever.  Next I applied to my leather seats in my 2010 Acura TL, which I have detailed annually myself, using a leather cleaner, followed by a conditioner, so they are in great shaped after 7 years and 75K miles.  When I traded in the car, the sales manager asked how I managed to get 74K miles on a vehicle with an interior that appears to be showroom quality.  I've been very pleased with the product and plan to use on my dress shoes next.In the cropped pic, you can see before (left) and after (right).  In the full pic, you can see the results, after wiping off the residue.

Ordee first time put them on my srx after 2nd day having all 7 colors only had 4 no purple or white or yellow. So I returned and got a new set. The company was great and very professional however finally installing them yesterday, testing them out before putting them on had all 7 colors, then next night turn them on an again only have 4 colors instead of 7, I really bought this set for the purple and this is the 2nd set that done this. Blue red an green are illegal to ride around with in my state so now can only have them on when parked because that's all I have is blue red and green. I don't think I'll buy another set of this brand, although the colors are nice the ones I have , it's just not worth getting 7 colors to only having four.

This product did not even fit my 2012 Jeep Wrangler. It was too wide, and would not sit where it was supposed to. The temperature sensor needs to be relocated and so does the wire loom at the top of the grille. This is not an easy "drop-in" modification for your Jeep Wrangler. Modifications are necessary to your vehicle to make it fit.To make matters worse, the item arrived damaged. The metal mesh that makes up the body of this unit was in pieces when I received it.

I am happy with this combination of lights/resistors. Nice and bright, I connected the resistor to flickering power wire (the one that comes on when you put your turn signal on) so it won't get extremely hot , that way it's only getting power when you put your tun signal and not constantly. That worked for me. I also read that they were not bright enough during the day, that might have to do how your bulb housing is built. I will post some day photos later when the weather changes. Okay took some pics in the day and they're not as bright.

I haul many horses for a rescue organization and getting those horses in and out of a trailer can be an interesting experience. I put this bumper on the back of the trailer to help protect their legs. After a year of hard use the bumper looks like it is brand new. Unlike some bumpers I have used in the past, this one stands up to horses, has not chipped or pulled away from the trailer, installation was very easyGood price and quick shipping. Product arrived on time. Will use again in the future.

Just got it.  Packaged well and seems to be in great shape.  I'll re-post after I get it up, running and try it out on the road.  I've been please with the other Furrion electronics that came in our new Keystone 32' 5ver.  If the camera works as well I'll be happy as hog in a wallow.  Our rig came pre-wired for the Furrion, and they give you LOTS of wire...too much actually for the small housing on the rear of the trailer.  From the Amazon reviews, it looks like the major complaints were from folks who had rigs 40' and over. so hoping my 32' will not tax the wireless signal.  More later.Update #1:  Tested the unit today.  Was already pared so started working as soon as I powered both units up.  Picture was clear and no disconnects.  I hard wired the monitor with an "add a circuit" and a 2 amp fuse to the fuse block in the dash because I didn't want the cigarette lighter cord flopping all over.  Again so far very pleased.  Major two month RV trip at the end of June so that will be a good road test.  I'll update then.Update #2:  Tried it out on a short trip.  Worked great.  Picture clear, no interruptions in signal.  Long summer trip coming up so we'll see how it does then but so far so good.  The only issue with installation of the camera on the 5ver was that Keystone put way too much wire to the pre-wired plug in.  Was hard to get it all crammed into the housing but that's not a Furrion issue.Update #3:  Just completed first leg of a long summer trip with this unit.  Yuma AZ  to Cedar City UT.  Again, using it to observe not only the toys loaded on my flatbed trlr  I'm pulling behind my 5th wheel, but also traffic to the rear and sides as my rig in triple is now a LONG one.  Product worked great!  Daytime image crystal clear and stable.  Night vision a bit grainy as with all NV tech, but still very helpful observing my load behind and traffic approaching.  Sure the screen could be bigger, BUT, I think a 7" monitor would block a lot of windshield view.  I experimented with diff locations and found that just to the left and slightly below my  rear view mirror was the optimum location.  Our 32' Keystone Cougar Lite 5th Whl came with the pre-wired Furrion housing, and with this model I don't have to have the running lights on as with most.  Would also recommend either removing it for extended storage (sun/rain/snow) as it's not hard to re-connect at all....or covering it as I did to protect it from the AZ sun.  So far VERY happy with this unit and would definitely recommend.  From here in CC it's on to Wyoming then back to Yuma.  I''ll advise at the end of the trip.UPDATE SEPT 19,  2017:Just returned from MANY miles of travel over the summer and the camera and monitor worked flawlessly.  I consider this one of my better investments RV wise.  Still VERY happy with the clarity of the picture (daytime 5 stars - nighttime 4 stars).  Really helps with both viewing the load on the flatbed towed behind my 5ver, AND with traffic approaching from the rear.  I recommend this unit.ONE YEAR LATER:  JUNE 2018  Just left on annual summer "pilgramage" to Utah from Yuma AZ.  Unit still functions well, clear picture, good signal.  VERY happy with it!  SIDE NOTE: I removed the entire mounting plate on the rear of my Cougar 5th wheel and then I was able to push excessive power cord into the trailer wall this eliminating the "too much wire" problem I mentioned above.

I wanted more rear light output on my new Harley, so i tried these out.  Light output was fantastic compared to stock incandescent bulbs.  Had more expensive led pods on bike i traded in, but loved the safety and the brightness of leds.  New bike had only two lights on back for brakes and i wanted more but didn't want to have to invest more money to get what i had before.  These fit the bill for $20 bucks they are plenty bright and light up the road behind me.  I will be ordering the amber set for the front also. First picture (led on right) is just running light brake is brighter.  Second pic is both rear installed running light, third is on brakes.  Much added rear safety at night.

I installed these on my 2015 F-250 Powerstroke short bed and I love them! It took me about 4 hours to install.  Easy to use, work perfectly. Couldn't be happier. The only part that was a little bid weird was a brake line that runs down the back of the axle and sits right where the 12" carriage bolt runs. I was able to get under it by angling the hardware forward and running the bolt between the axle and the brake line which so far has been working like a champ.

I installed these fog LEDs in my 06 Kia Optima. These LEDs are insanely bright and such a good upgrade for those crappy halogens. Installation was extremely simple; just plug n' play (I had to take my tire off to access the fogs). I love the bright white/crystal blue hue that the lights project and the range is about 15 feet which is very impressive. I have LEDs all inside & outside my my car cause they look so much better and last longer. The attached picture shows the halogen headlight vs the led fogs (obviously the headlights are brighter than the fogs) but the color in the LED is ten times better and clearer.

I have been using mobil 1 0w40 in all my mercedes since 2009 till now. On my older m119 engine i use to put 10w40 regular oil and the oil pressure would drop to dangerous levels after the oil warmed up. So after putting 0w40 the engine runs alot smoother. Also these modern synthetic oils are great with keeping the internals clean. I will post a pic of the heads on the m119 engine with 210k miles (mobil since 110k). I use this oil on m119,113,113k,112,275 and anyother mercedes i have come across. If you are a DIY person i would recommend getting a mityvac and some mann filters, and 2 boxes of these oils. Oil change on mercedes is the simplest oil change (topside oil change).

[Update 8/20/2016]Purolator changed the filter line up.  PureONE used to be the top end, but is now mid range.  Boss is the new top end.  When you buy this, you probably will get the new ONE, which has the same model number, same size and same fit as the old PureONE.However, as shown in my side-to-side comparison picture, the color is now blue instead of yellow, and the sandy texture coating is now gone.  This means I have to use a tool to tighten, as my oily hand can't grip it tight enough anymore.  My tool sometimes makes a small dent or scratch on the filter (if I squeeze it too hard), which doesn't matter for removal, but could be a potential leak spot for a new filter.  So I have to buy a new tool as well.The construction looks the same, but it's hard to know what's really going on inside.  Maybe I'll try the BOSS or the Royal Purple next.------The Purolator PL14612 fits my Infinity FX35 well and has the same size and shape as the Infinity OEM one.Infinity and Nissan tend to use very small oil filters like this one. With the small size, high flow is very important because if sludge blocked off an area, there is more clean surface for oil to go through.  This filter has more pleats to increase filter surface area. It's also very well built, perhaps even better than OEM filter, according to many people who cut it open.Like very one else, I love the sandy coating that requires no tool to put on or take off.I had engine blow-by on my old car, even though I replaced the oil and filter religiously at the auto shop.  I suspect poor oil and oil filter quality to be the problem.  On my current car, I'm changing oil and filter myself so that I could use synthetic oil and this higher quality filter.

Works as intended but beware that the spring safety pins are rather tight.  They would not go over the springs on a 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee, so were effectively useless.Otherwise, they worked great.  No slippage or unusual wear.

I used this adapter to look at the ODB port on my Honda Ridgeline, it came back with no error faults but showed me some great stats on mpg and other sensors which showed me it was operating as expected. I did connect to this via WIFI although you could use bluetooth. I then connected this to my father in laws mini van and found a number of faults some of which he knew from driving but a couple he didn't. Using this connector we were able to quickly diagnose his issues which saved a trip to the mechanic. At the push of a button you can "Clear" the fault codes once the issues are resolved without having to pay someone else to do it. This adapter works very well and the app that goes with it is free, although there is a paid version which I have not used or needed. At the end of the day this works great.Please note you can connect to this via wifi or bluetooth, if you connect via wifi and the system returns fault codes it may not know what they are and you may need to search online, if you do that it will error because your wifi is connected to the OBD connector, if you use bluetooth to connect to the reader then it can still search the web without issues.Please note, I received this at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.

My local tire guy refused to sell these. He said they don't last very long. The wear rating is 440. The Dorals he wanted to sell me had a 400 rating. I confronted him with that while his guys were installing the Ohtsu's on my 15 Kia Soul with new 17" rims. He said, you can't trust those ratings because are rated by the company that makes the tire. He also said they become very noisy after a while.  I am starting to have my doubts about this guy.Now to the tire. All I know is that my car drive like it's on glass. It's more stable & they look kewl. There is no way to tell how long these tires will last, but if i get a trouble free 35,000 out of them, it will be worth it.Update 03/05/17. These tires now sound like a  freight train going downhill over gravel. Either that or my bearings are going out at 23,000 miles. Horrible!!!

I got this to wrap the pipe on my ATV (Four-Wheeler) as I was getting burned THROUGH the plastic body work. I had purchased an aftermarket exhaust system which significantly increased the temperature of the exhaust components. I wrapped the pipe from the point where it attaches to the engine, all the way up to the muffler. This, along with the purchase and application of Thermo-Tec Heat and Sound Suppressor ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004PIIAZ0 ) lowered the temperature of my plastic body work from 120-125 degrees down to 100 degrees.It has a pretty cool look to it, like carbon fiber, but all of my pipe is hidden behind plastic so that didn't matter to me. You will need metal hose clamps to keep it wrapped around the pipe. Please ignore the zip-ties in the included picture. They were only used to hold the material as I was applying it. Hose clamps were installed and zip-ties removed.

These things whistle like crazy when unloaded and folded down.  I specifically bought these because I didn't want to constantly take the regular J-style carriers on and off.  But I'll probably end up taking these on and off anyway because the constant pitch of that wind whistle is driving me crazy and it's only been a week.But they do hold the kayak in place very well.  And the included straps are very nice as well.Update:  3/29/17:  Any speed 30mph or greater, and it's a loud, unbearable whistle.  It's even loud with the windows up.  Incredibly annoying.  I now regret buying these and my return window is gone.  Reduced rating to two stars.Update:  6/29/17:  And now one of them has broke.  Something broke internally, and it will no longer lock into place.  It's very loose and wobbly, and eventually falls back farther than it is supposed to move/travel.  Since new, I've used these 5-6 times over the course of 3 months, and now they are completely unusable.  Very disappointed.  Reduced rating to 1 star.

The Curt Hitch is well made and solid. If you haven't installed a hitch before, I would recommend watching the Curt Hitch video. Youll need to raise the back end of the truck so you can work under it. In addition, youll need a powerful drill and necessary steel drill bits. I purchased the bits from Home Depot. I installed the hitch by myself and it took me about two hours. Also use WD40 to loosen the muffler rubber hangers. Ive attached a few photos. Good luck!

I absolutely love this bag.. it's big so I don't feel like I have to empty it everyday. Perfect for the "CTV"...Child Transporting Vechile;o)  It has a space to put dog/diaper bags and mesh pockets on each end. I Leave it hanging around the headrest on my front passenger seat and when someone is riding with me I flip it to the back! I pulled the fastening strap over the bag so you can see how long it is...this thing will fit around the whole seat It I needed it to.Also, it has an internal removable trash pocket so if some leftover trash spills I can just unvelcro it, bring it inside and give it a good wash while leaving the actual bag attached and placing a temporary grocery bag in it while the other dries.Thank you Phil, for cleaning up my life, one piece at a time!!

The body of the actuator was not welded, sealed or glued in any way. After 3 months of use the body split open and the unit stopped functioning.I was able to re-seat the electric motor and close the unit back up. It functioned but without plasti-welding the case just splits again and the small electric motor inside of the unit slips off its connection.Since options are few for affordable replacements I opted to have a warranty exchange for this unit. I will use a soldering iron to weld the seam of the new unit prior to installation.-3 stars for lack of quality+2 stars because it's something that I can remedy

This OBDII scanner device has been an awesome tool for vehicle diagnostics. I no longer need a shop to clear an O2 code or anything like that. As someone who works on my own vehicles, replacing coils, plugs, wires, sensors, etc. This tool is very useful. I have also began using it to track my vehicle diagnostics in real time with a mobile application called torque. I am able to log vehicle data onto my tablets external storage using the app and this scanner tool.Since the scanner has an on and off button it makes the logging easy to use. This sort of data can be graphed and looked at later if you start noticing any sort of problem with your vehicle. Odd RPM drops? You can identify them with this tool as long as you are disciplined about taking readings.Dimensions can be seen in the photos I have attached.Included is just the scanner dongle. There is no extension cord or anything, it just connects directly to the OBDII port.Pros:*Graph all available ECU data*Clear OBDII codes on your ownCons:*NoneAdditional Considerations:If you want to have an easier time plugging the scanner in you can get an extension cord in order to plug in the scanner in more plain view.Overall: 5/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 5 starsIf you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

When I unwrapped this, I did not expect it to work-I assumed the iPhone would slide off the stand if it was tilted to near-vertical. Fortunately, I was quite wrong.Take a look at the photo I uploaded to the Customer Images section above. As you can see, this stand adheres easily to a slightly sloped section of my dashboard. With the top surface tilted to about 30 degrees off vertical, the iPhone 5 does not slip. This puts the phone in an ideal position for use as a handsfree turn-by-turn GPS. I've been using it this way since it arrived a few days ago. The pads remain in place even when I remove the iPhone after each trip.Please note that the stand adheres to a slight slope in one direction (like the side of a large drum), but will not handle a curve in two directions (like a sphere). In my photo, the dashboard in front of the steering wheel curves side-to-side and front-to-back so the stand will not work there. It does work well in the center of the dash.This is the best mobile device mount I've used. It makes the ones with weighted bases like this one&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Amzer-Universal-Non-Slip-Weighted-Beanbag-Dash-Mount-Mount-Bulk-Packaging-Black/dp/B002LZUQMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Amzer Universal Non-Slip Weighted Beanbag Dash Mount - Mount - Bulk Packaging - Black</a>&nbsp;look really silly in comparison. No mechanical clamps and suction cups to fail. If the adhesive gel pads get dirty, just rinse and dry them.Brilliant product, well designed. 5 stars, highly recommended.

I give myself a one star rating for not buying this sooner.  The plate is a 1/4" thick so you do not have to worry about bending this thing, you will not have to gorilla torque it anyways.  I had to set this up on the right side since my hitch does not extend past the rear bumper and because of the way Andersen MFG. makes their Rapid Hitch (short shank with the pin hole halfway down the length so there is no room for this tightener).  After I tightened both nuts (flat and lock washers come with this fyi) I yanked and yanked on my hitch and it would not move any direction.  I will update this review if I need to after I have my loaded trailer hooked up next week for a 1,300 mile road trip.  That will be the real test.

Edit 8/3/2016: For anyone considering this jack for the purpose of having a 24" lift height, you MUST order the extra low profile option listed here on Amazon. It is the XL2T model. It's more expensive, heavier, and lifts to a full 24" saddle height. I'll post a pic next to a tape measure when I have time.Please refrain from cluttering my review with negative comments due to your inability to comprehend that the Amazon listing features 2 different jack models. I'm assuming those of you who cheaped out got the smaller model, and now feel the need to blame me for your purchasing error.EDIT: I was finally able to use this jack. It's awesome! It actually lifts higher than my jack stands so it looks like I'll be getting larger stands in order to take full advantage of the lifting height.The saddle reached the lifting point in 1 1/2 strokes (not sure I actually did a full stroke as I was making sure everybing was adjusted properly for the initial lift). It raised the car very quickly and fairly effortlessly. I have contacted Arcan about replacement parts but have not received a reply. I'm hoping to be able to order a spare piston as inevitably it will fail. I'm just hoping to get at least 4-5 years out of it.I've also noticed the price has dropped by $10 over the past 2 weeks since ordering mine.Original review:Please note that I have not used this jack yet. This is only a review of unpacking it and comparing it to my shot craftsman.First off, this thing is heavy. I think it's about 100 lbs. Fortunately, it rolls rather well across the garage floor. Also, Amazon Prime included free shipping. I've noticed that Northern Tool charges $100 to ship the same jack.On first impression this thing is NICE. It lifts to a full 24". I'll post a comparison pic next to my Craftsman, which by the way is shot and leaks all the fluid out when under load. The Craftsman tops out at 18.5".  The Arcan is also lower and longer than the Craftsman. The only advantage with the Craftsman is the weight. I think it only weighs around 40 lbs.I use a hockey puck to lift the vehicles on the pinch welds at the jack points on the sides. It fits perfectly on the saddle of the Arcan. No need to buy pricey saddle cushions/covers.I'm going to attempt to get to some exhaust work on a car this weekend, so I'll update with how well it works under load. Also, as a precaution, I "bled" the jack following the directions, just incase there was any air trapped from shipping.

Current 2-star review for same cargo bag, now with "Reese" brandI posted a 5-star review shortly after purchase on 2/11/2017, however, after using this cargo bag for several months, and having Reese replace it under warranty because of two issues, I am revising to 2-stars for the following reasons:This cargo bag leaked badly in moderate to heavy rain even when the Velcro fasteners were still present, then most of the Velcro fasteners peeled off.The replacement bag that Reese provided leaked just as badly.  Since this cargo bag fits my 60 inch X 20 inch hitch carrier perfectly and provides more storage space than any other cargo bag that I have found for this carrier, I found a way to stop the leaks and hopefully make it less likely that the Velcro strips that Reese installed will peel off. I added 2 inch long X 3/4 wide Velcro strips between the strips that Reese installed on this cargo bag. (Please refer to photos.) The Velcro adhesive has yet to fail in two months of use.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/VELCRO-Brand-Sticky-Back-5-x-3-4-34-Tape-Black/dp/B00006IC2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">VELCRO Brand  - Sticky Back  - 5' x 3/4" Tape - Black</a>Reese does have good customer service, even if the are a bit slow in providing assistance.Original 2/17/2017 5 star review for Pro Series Amigo branded  version of this cargo bag:The Pro-Series 63604 Amigo Hitch Cargo Carrier Bag is a great product, however, the are some limitations with regard to operating the zipper in cold weather: The vinyl from which the bag is constructed becomes very stiff in cold weather.  In order to open or close the zipper past the corners of the lid onto the sides of the cover, you have to turn the weatherproof zipper cover flap inside out.  If you do this in cold weather,  you risk damaging the weatherproof zipper cover, because the vinyl material is much less flexible that it is at higher temperatures.I have used the Amigo in temperatures low as mid- 30's to low 40s. At those temperatures, I believe it is inadvisable to turn the weatherproof zipper cover flap inside out. You could still use the Amigo in colder these temperatures, however, I recommend keeping the zippers on the front of this cargo bag and not trying to go past the corners.  Once the temperature is around 50 degrees or above, the zipper cover flap is flexible enough so that you can easily turn the zipper cover flap inside out.

Ordered the small first as it said it was the right one for a ST205 R75 14" but it didn't fit the tire and left several inches showing from the ground.  The proper cover is this next size up for 26.75-29" which fits the 26" diameter tire perfectly.  Will be returning the other that was supposed to fit.  Picture shows the wheel cover 26.75 - 29" on a 26" diameter tire.

Update 27Jun2015 - credit where it's due. 24 hours after i installed the system, i found that the remote no longer turned off the DRL's. Could only turn them off by disconnecting the wires on the battery. Emailed the Opt7 support and within a couple of hours, was advised that a replacement was being sent. Received two days later. (another reviewer had this problem also, and gave the product one star but you have to give the supplier a chance to make right...)I found these 2 days AFTER i had already ordered another set of 6" cob lights and a separate remote control unit...However, these came before my other Amazon order has even been shipped ... Opt7 supplier direct shipping is prompt!And, these came in at $20 vs the $25 for the others i'm still waiting on... (i'll put them in another car...)Onto the product !Delivered via USPS, padded bag with two boxes inside, picture one is the contents of the boxes, one for the 2 cob lights and the other smaller box holding the remote control and receiver unit. Also included is a nice warranty card with contact details if anything at all is not right and how to get support... didn't have to use it, but it's nice to know that they included such things to show how important the customer is to them...I put these into my Audi A4 (2003) but wanted them recessed, not sticking in the front of the car or highly visible (not a fan of the bright yellow face?) and found that they were a perfect fit into horizontal slates of the fog light grill.After a bit of grill plastic engineering (slice / cut / smooth) to remove the verticle grills (didn't like how they broke the single light bar into 3 uneven sections), and a trip to home depot for a bit of aluminium siding ($2 L bar, slotted beneath the grill in place and provided a backing for support and to apply the adhesive to),  rigged in place and tested before i ran the wires and crimped it all together...Then tidied up wiring (which i had to use some additional because there's no way the supplied wiring will work around to both sides of the car engine bay), found a safe and secure spot for the remote receiver,  and all done.All in all, about 2 hours worth of work for someone who only dabbles around with cars and know basics of the electrics and i'm really pleased with the results. These are mainly for safety, not looks, I prefer to have DRL's but didn't want them to be 'loud' and visually unappealing.The remote works from about 30 feet away (with it's little antenna out) ... so it's another feature that another reviewer pointed out... At night, when looking for your car, you can use the remote to light up the car / area to more easily find it and for security!All in all, an excellent, non expensive addition to any car and i highly recommend this product. it went in perfectly easily (even with my OCD positioning requirements) and time will tell how long they'll last but replacements are cheap and i didn't have to screw or glue anything to place them where they are so removal / replacement will be easy.The ONLY suggestion i'd like to make is that the remote control to have separate On and Off buttons as using the same button, makes it hard to know (if you're not near or in front of the car) if it's been left on or not. The remote has 3 buttons, one for ON/OFF, one for STATIC (just solid on) , and one to cycle through some funky strobe / flashing / alternating patterns ... think cop lights (none of which i can imagine ever using but someone would i'm sure).Post a comment if you have any questions, i'll answer what i can !Thanks for the read :)

This is hands down one of the BEST mods for a chevy camaro. Mine is a 2011 Camaro 2LT RS Convertible. I hated the yellow-tinge of the daytime running lamps, and often wanted to be able to drive with the night time lights on while retaining the daytime lamps (which should be fog lamps). This is the perfect solution and at most a 20 minute job! Just a simple harness to unplug, plug this in, and you're good to go! Perfect combination with the LED lamps. The only downfall is there were no instructions, but there are plenty of reviews on this page (with photo guides) to get you through this simple and easy job!

Edit- second unit of the pair went right in without an issue and fits fine. Removing the first revealed the cap had cracked at the  c-clip groove.Thejoints appear fine, but the fitment is off. They are just about 1.5 mm too big to seat the caps properly. Using these to replace the original front axle u-joints in a 99 Wrangler sahara. I took care pressing them in evenly, but it bottoms out just before the groove for the second c-clip becomes visible. Might also be the tolerances of the stub axle, but I will likely have to just use the standard duty joints.

I bought these for the wash room, where the cat's litter box is kept. They have helped. I also trim the long hairs between their paws. We have a two story home, that is mostly tile and wood flooring. I used to find it on the stairs, but that is not happening anymore. We do still find some in the bed though. In the process of buying the female edge trim from their site directly, since they are not on Amazon (to tie the two rooms together better)(I have the whole wash room covered as well as a strip of the room outside).They are a bit spendy but hopefully they will last for many years. The cats and humans walk on it fine. Once the pieces snap together, they do not come apart easy. So...if you want to be able to clean under it..you need to vacuum or not make the sections too big.

Last year I upgraded the headlights in my f-150 to the OEM HID's.  The only issue was the fog lights were still yellow/orange.  I spent a small fortune for better looking and functioning headlights only to be left with sub par fogs.  I decided to try these LED lamps and I'm glad I did.  Looking at the photos the stock is on the left and the JDM LED is on the right.  You can tell the difference day or night.  They look fantastic, the fogs are a clean white instead of a dingy orange incandescent.The bulbs are have a nice weight to them and don't feel cheap.  They fit perfectly and had no issues with the OEM harness or working or alignment issues.  I want to upgrade my brake lights next.  I received these bulbs at a discount in exchange for testing and reviewing the product. I stand by my review and do not give discounted products great reviews if they do not deserve them. I count on honest reviews when making purchases as much as you do!

Far superior extension mirror than "that other brand".  I bought two different brand mirrors, and these are clearly better.  It is built out of higher quality plastic and has reinforcement webbing inside the arms.  The strapping system is actually a ratchet that works very well once you figure out how to operate it.  The straps also have a huge shoe with a big rubber  sole that will keep you from scratching up your original mirror.  A nice touch is that as you ratchet down, the four clips that slide under your original mirror will also tighten up.  Cool.  I did a quick test drive, and the mirror did shake a little (not nearly as bad as "that other brand".  However, I think the majority of the shaking came from the original mirror being over loaded from wind forces.  I couldn't get ANY wiggle between the mirror to mirror interface.  It was TIGHT!This is a quality extension mirror that I'm sure I'll get a lot of life out of.  I fit it to a 2005 Toyota Tacoma perfectly.Nobody gave me any free stuff for this review.  In general, I never get free stuff.  I just don't get the love....whatever.  The mirror is still good.  I'm gonna buy another.

Gasket seems to be exactly what I ordered, except that I didn't want an opened one that hand finger prints all over it. The packaging for the item itself was opened. Product was not damaged but it looks like someone else opened it up with their greasy hands, touched every portion, then stuffed it back in and taped it back up.

Just installed these. They are very bright. Obviously as they are LEDs. Don't forget they have a polarity to them. They do still glow a teeny bit while off but that's normal. Due to there being a small current they can pick up. Good quality and they got here when I was told they would be. I'd say if you don't like the halogen light color and like the white sunlight color, these are what you should look into. Next step is LED headlights. Not HID.  In the pictures is them off and on. You can see them barely on, and then ON. Its the afternoon now bit when its dark these will light the truck cab perfectly.

These lights are awesome!!! So glad I came across it. Finally had them put in after I got them a month ago, just couldn't find the time. Well these things are super bright but not enough to blind in coming cars. They are energy efficient so that means they don't get hot.  Overall I'm very satisfied and glad I bought it. Perfect fit for my 2013 Camaro LS

The Gearbox arrived in good condition. Fits perfectly in my 2012 Silverado Crew Cab. Makes great use for storing under the rear seats. I often keep a few things under there such as an umbrella but items occasionaly slide out. The Gearbox is a good fit - flat to the floor and to the underside of the seat making best use of the space without waste. Very easy to install and easy to take out of needed. The dividers easily remove for storage of long items. I posted photos of installation with the split seats up as well as folded down.

the light is very bright and white but the problem I found was that one bulb did not worked as well the others did. 4 of the 16 smd light bulb things (the yellow points) did not worked and other 4 flicker a lot so I emailed customer service and after a day or two and a few pictures I got a new one free of charge that worked perfectly and kept the not working one so I used it on another car, for only half of it working lights on pretty bright

Let there be BRIGHT light! I purchased the HID Xenon Conversion Kit with "Slim" Digital Ballasts H11 bulbs at 5000k.This is my second HID kit purchase, I returned my last one (from Innovited) because there was a flicker issue upon ignition and also because it looked and felt like a low-end product compared to this one. Kensun also puts their lights in a neatly packaged small metal case, looking really high quality and not cheap at all.I took a second chance due to the great reviews and because I was tired of my "Philips Ultimate White Light Diamond Vision" halogen lights (they were a tease to the real thing, pretty white but no brightness whatsoever). And now that I got this beauty installed, I definitely WON'T look back!Installed this on my 2012 Nissan Altima Coupe, with effort because Nissan doesn't make things easy! It should have really taken about 20 mins but I was at it for over an hour, double making sure that the ballasts were secure (I used 3M double sided tape + velcro for extra security).It should be noted that when it comes to HID kits you should purchase them at 35W because that's what a TRUE HID kit should run at. 55W kits can have flickering issues, may need 20 amp fuses, and have shorter life. In all honesty, compared to my previous 55W kit this 35W kit was much brighter, with the color I was expecting - 5000k pure white, and best of all I didn't have to change any fuses as it only takes 7 amps to ignite and 3.5 amps to run.A second note, if your car doesn't have projector housings then please either buy new headlights with projectors or buy a typical halogen light like the "Philips Ultimate White Light Diamond Vision". Traditional reflector housings should never have a HID bulbs in them, not only will you blind everyone on the road but you also run the risk of being pulled over for bright lights. Additionally, you will just spread light everywhere and lose a lot of road visibility which is not practical at all.Good luck!

After reading a previous review i decided to remove the cover to clarify the "densogate" controversy.  First, i purchased 3 of these guys for a retrofit so i wasn't happy to read they may be fake.  I opened them all and they look exactly like the real thing on the inside (see pic) and nothing  like the crappy pictures posted in the link on hid planet.  I am not saying they are real, but they look real and they light the bulb extremely quickly like the real thing.  I am unsure of the motives of the previous reviewer - i am not saying his review is a blatant lie and he should be banished to a world of halogen only lighting, but perhaps he was duped by an unscrupulous seller ?  In my opinion, these are an awesome buy.

This product must be made for the newer Honda's, I have a 2008 Civic and it's too short. 3 stars because it's a nice product but not the right size for me.

I'm sure this is a great gas cap, but not for my 2005 Toyota Matrix XR. The listing stated that this gas cap would fit my vehicle. Other people had asked if it fitted a 2005 Toyota Matrix and people had responded to that question with "Yes, it does". Based on that info, I purchased this gas cap.As soon as it arrived, I went to install it and I immediately noticed that it was much less bulky than my old gas cap. Then I realized that the threads are completely different! This gas cap has actual threads, whereas mine does not and instead has little "nub" things that have to slot in before you turn the cap.I looked on Amazon again and I think I probably need this&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Genuine-Toyota-77300-33070-Fuel-Tank-Cap-Assembly/dp/B005CDNCQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Genuine  Toyota (77300-33070) Fuel Tank Cap Assembly</a>&nbsp;instead.

Happy with the upgrade over my stock 1-piece hub/rotor design so far.Simple install and my trucks braking is smooth as butter. No pulsing or issues.Replaced my oem due to a broken tone ring on one of my front rotors which wascausing the abs to go nuts.

So this fits pretty good, looks good, and is bright! My only problem is I had to fight back and forth about getting the hardware to to attach the light bar to the bracket. It's difficult because I'm pretty sure I was emailing with China, and I would only get a response a day. I kept getting told I had to use my factory hardware, well Jeeps don't come with a factory light bar.. anyway, they eventually sent me the bolts to mount the light bar by snail mail. The box was a little beat up, so maybe they were in there but they fell out? Everything was in very good shape though! Looks great and easy to install!

UPDATE 10/01/2017:  No issues thus far.  Work perfectly!I used these JDM ASTAR LEDs to replace the stock 194-style bulbs in my SPEC-D Tuning 2LHP-IPA06-TM LED U-BAR Projector Headlights (picture attached).Once again, the JDM LEDs slipped into place and offered an obvious and immediate upgrade to the rather subtle side-markers on the otherwise stellar SPEC-D Headlights--these are far brighter and therefore more noticeable!There are brighter 194-style LEDs out there (Lumen PlaZma), but they're twice the price, and I didn't want my side-markers overwhelming my LED U-Bar Halo lights.  These fit in perfectly.I cannot speak to longevity yet, but as is and at this price, they get an easy Five Stars!RayB

I read reviews by others that expressed misgivings and problems. Maybe I got lucky but I am giving 5 stars for sure. Fit perfectly. Snug? Yep, but manageable. All holes were drilled, they all lined up, hardware was complete, and the directions were crystal clear. The look is stunning and the protection going forward is priceless. I am so pleased with this purchase. I have WeatherTech mud flaps that had to remove to install these but that was easy as well. Between the two items, my back end is protected and really sharp looking.

looks Excellent quality, I bought a lot of Hella relay (micro & mini) and written on it (Made in China).!!! that's strange...I plan to use a one micro relay for each "HIR 65w bulbs"But suddenly i have many devices in my car require 40amp (not 20amp like the micro).So i bought also (mine 20/40amp) for it.No terminal with it. you must put a terminal on the wire and plug it in the relay socket to hold and tied the relay.I bought a hella micro relay box. watch the photos. hold 7 relays. seem a high quality.I just wiring the wire and make it ready for the installation. and test it and its work.I will update you if any thing happen.All and all i like it. and it's enough for me that is from big name like Hella.look at the pictures, It's for micro relays. I hope from Hella make one for the mini relay. its will be great.Note:I saw in the box from Italy and in the part from China! !!  I don't remember which part the relay or the relay box..

I just had a chance to use Nu Finish on my red truck. I was hoping Nu Finish could bring back to life the luster of my truck. We all know that red looks great when the vehicle is new but tends to fade as time goes by. All in all the Nu Finish did a pretty good job. It took a lot of the oxidation off the paint. The places where the paint was in good shape looks new again. I found that wiping it off quickly after applying it gave me the best results. I strongly suggest you do small sections at a time. Nu Finish dries quickly and can be difficult to remove if left on too long. I have read other reviews about the bad smell. It does smell bad but not any worse than other polishes and wax's I have used in the past. If you keep your expectations realistic I think you will be happy with this product. It will not bring back a totally failed paint job to showroom condition, but it will make your car look better.

The Master Power Window Switch on my 2003 Dodge Durango was bad...only the driver could open all the windows. Apparently this is a common problem with some years of Dodge Trucks. It was easy to change out...pop out the old one, unplug it, take the bezel off, attach the bezel to the new switch and re-install. Problem solved. The lights for the switch is a slightly different color and is brighter than the original which is fine with me. Pictured is the old switch which was pretty nasty looking.

Bought this for my 370Z and the initial use went fine, but on the very next oil change, the head snapped off leaving the shank and magnet threaded in my oil pan.  I was using a torque wrench set at 24 ft lbs (spec is 22-29) and the wrench had not yet ticked off at my torque setting.  The head snapped off at somewhere under the 24 ft lb setting.  As the car was on jack stands in my driveway with no oil in the engine, this could have been quite an expensive problem. Fortunately I was able to work the broken shank out of the drain hole using my fingertip.  Since I could not find the original, I had to make a trip to the local auto parts store to buy a standard drain plug.  I don't believe I will try another of these.

I ordered this for a 2003 Toyota Sienna right side (passenger). This picture does not match the picture of the G57098 at Gabriels own web site. Notice the tab is on the wrong side and there is no tab for the brake line. Just a note to check to see if your shock matches this picture before ordering. I'm not sure what's going on but I received one and the box is clearly labeled G57101 which is clearly not the right strut assembly.

I installed the front energy suspension kit on my 2006 Escalade and the fit was perfect. This rear 28mm rear sway bar kit was not a good fit for two reasons. First, the sway bar bushings were on the small side.  I was concerned there was going to be a gap as I cranked them down. It was close enough together. But still that bushing was not quite big enough. The end link grommets were too large and too deep. No matter how much I pressed on them they would not stay completely in they would partially pop out on their own. So I went to the store and bought a brand new pair of end links to see if that would help. Same thing. that little end link grommet is just too big. So I could not use half the kit. Also if you do get it to fit you will have to bend your end link frame bracket so the rubber will fit between. aftermarket grommets are wider than the OE rubber

The item had some damages, but would work well if in perfect shape.  Received from Boss Motorsports through Amazon.  It does fit into a Jeep.  Locking mechanism and pistons are good quality, the thickness of the aluminum allows for a 170 pound guy to sit on the box, but this isn't a high security box.  You could pry it open if you tried hard enough.  For the price, it's worth it though and if you don't have a rear seat in your jeep CJ5 this fits well.

I haven't used this product much, but I do want to warn people that there is an indentation in the bottom (up front) for this chock to fit on one of the Tri Lynx levelers (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Tri-Lynx-00015-10-Lynx-Leveler/dp/B0028PJ10K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tri Lynx 00015 (10)  Lynx Leveler</a>).  This is good because if the tire is sitting on one of the levelers that this chock is integrated in, the chock won't move.  I suppose that you could still use this chock without one of their levelers, but it won't sit flat on the ground due to that indentation mentioned above.  If your RV doesn't need a leveler, then using this chock may not work as designed.  You may want to consider one of the chocks that doesn't require a leveler to use (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Camco-44492-RV-Super-Wheel-Chock/dp/B0007TR4CQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Camco 44492 RV Super Wheel Chock</a>).  I'll update this post when I get more experience with them (it comes in a set of two chocks).

Just got these installed tonight and so far I'm happy with them. I have always bought the Silverstar Ultras before this but decided to give these a try. They are definitely whiter than the SSUs and maybe a little brighter. The right side of the garage door is the Philips bulb and left is a Silverstar Ultra. The second picture is to show the color temperature compared to my factory fog lights. Going to have to upgrade them now!

So first off, it's not paint ready right out of the box, you need to wet sand it with 2000 paper to make it ready then prime then sand again because well I guess for the price it's alright but there were some imperfections and scratches, looks like it was painted because when sanding it some of the paint cheaped off... Again you get what you pay for, the lip didn't fit in perfectly into the bottoms grill of my 2001 bumper but I can deal with it, other than that it's a lip that fits pretty well other than around my bottom grill, there is space and it's because it just doesn't fit well. There weren't any pictures when I bought the lip on Amazon so I thought to post some so you guys can see what it's going to look like, befores and afters.I can't stress this enough... YOU MUST SAND! Primer it, sand it again then primer it again. Seriously if you want it to come out nice so it that way. There will be imperfections on your lip. Installation was pretty easy I used double sided tape and the screws that we provided.And sorry for not the greatest pictures I just toke them quickly.

Seat cover fit relatively well on my three Honda quads. The only issue I have is that the covers have already bleached out from the sun and are now a pink / red camouflage. This happened within two weeks of installing them. The fabric is holding up though and that was the main purpose of buying them; to protect the vinyl and padding.

Got these with TH450R feet because I was led to believe that this setup would be compatible with a VW Tiguan with Panoramic sunroof. It is. I installed the feet pushed out just about as far as they could go on the rails and they are totally out of the way of the sunroof.Install was pretty easy. Note that the bars are harder to get on the feet the correct way than they are to slide on the incorrect way. Other than that, it was pretty straight forward.... I am concerned by the rubberized grip strap that holds the foot in place. I don't know how they're put together but am only concerned that they might dry out.As for the bars being quiet, I am satisfied. Except at low speed (somewhere around 25mph) they are fairly quiet. At low speed they make a whistle (without the Rhino Rack Platform in the picture; with the platform things get very loud.)Have now driven about 5000 miles with them (mostly under heavy load) and am quite pleased with their performance.

I would have liked to share my experience with the Honda 15400-PLM-A01 Oil Filter but Dealer Sales Solutions LLC sent me the lower quality Honda 15400-PLM-A02. Externally it looks almost the same but the manufacturer and the  internal built are different. I believe the 15400-PLM-A02 has an internal paper filter.

I got the job done BUT....The tube was too short so it couldn't rest on the floor.It arrived with a kink that made things a bit difficult so I couldn't rest it on the suspension somewhere.In the end I let it dangle in the air.  Luckily it didn't fall off and make a mess.The tube reacted with dot3 brake fluid.  It browned and became soft.  I uploaded a picture so you can see how it looked after one use.The cup is way too small.  You end up running around like a man possessed.  OK for bleeding but no good if you want to completely change the fluid out like I wanted to.Only plus I can think of is the different sized rubber attachments for bleed nipples.  That's a nice touch.Had to call Amazon because I was 5 days past my return date.  They told me I could have a refund as a one time favour.  I told them to pull it off the shelves and contact everyone who has bought it so they can get new free tubes.

These are so cool! I'm so glad I bought these opposed to the kind that fits on the "hump" of the back seat leg room. It's a very nice smooth and soft vinyl material. I got the 2 pack, one for tissues(puffs) and one for napkins. The visor clips on the back fits great on the backseat pockets and the door side cup holder. If you're somewhat OCD or just really organized, you need these!

Perfect fit, front and rear.  Recently had to replace both CCV elbows, not PCV.  If you are replacing the elbows on a Jeep 4.0l do some research and make sure you get the right ones.  On certain 4.0l the flow is critical as some use a CCV system.  See diagram below.  You'll need a low flow elbow in the rear of the valve cover and high flow in the front.  Just make sure you get the right ones for your engine.  The Grommet itself was well made and easy to install.  Getting the old ones out, not so easy.  It does help if it is a warm day or a warm engine.  Regardless, these fit very well and tight.Front Elbowhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JZIXIWRear Elbow (Amazon said this didn't fit my 2000 Cherokee but they were wrong)http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JZI1U2/

Installed in a 2017 RAM 3500 dually. 72sq/ft covered the floor from the firewall  up the back wall to the rear window, the two front door panels and the 6 lower side panels. I think I have  .5sq/ft left over. I initially thought it made am incredible difference, which it did, but it seems that each day the mat takes hold the better it gets. The truck not only sounds quieter it feels more solid. It was more expensive than other products but since it was a fairly large job I didn't want to have to do it again if the competing products were inferior.

Granted I've only had them 1 day, for the money, I'm thoroughly impressed. My only concern long term is the hardware. It doesn't look like stainless steel so it may rust. It's supposed to rain all week so we will see if any moisture gets in the lights but as of now, these are 5 star as far as I'm concerned. They are super bright and very pure white.

These are just what I was looking for to put in my 2004 Ford Ranger Edge.  They were super easy to install, however the existing dust cover on my headlight housing did not fit over the new bulbs, I was able to secure the black connector with a few spins of black tape.  It would probably be fine without the tape, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.The lights are a brilliant white with only a slight lean toward the blue spectrum.  They are bright but not over powering.  After aiming my headlamps the night of install I drove around some pretty populated areas and I didn't get flashed once, so it would seem they're not very distracting to other drivers which is always a plus.I hope that they hold up like they should.  If they should fail I will update the review, but as of now they're great.

Exactly what I was looking for in the rebuild..However, one assembly was defective. the brown wire had wire strands contacting the housing which is the ground side of the circuit. I chose  to fix with a soldering iron versus returning one kit for a replacement. Your choice. Be sure to test before installing.

This stuff is magic in a box. For the longest time (maybe even from new) my car has had these paint imperfections on the right side. I have no idea what they were but washing and waxing did not remove them, I figured my paint was just ruined forever. I decided to buy this claybar kit because it was really cheap on Amazon, I had used claybars before when I worked for a detailing place for a short while but I kinda always thought it was just a gimmick. No longer do I think this is just a gimmick it is nothing short of amazing what this product and a little time accomplished...See the before and after pictures below (it started raining while I was finishing up so the after picture has a few rain drops in it).This kit came with two 80g clay bars. I split one in half and used that, I got about 1 side of my Charger done using half of one bar.I will say that this kit isn't necessary, I found that soap and water actually works better than the spray which you've really got to use liberally to provide adequate protection. At the sale price I got this for it was worth it but full price I'd probably just go get a 200 gram bar on ebay instead of the whole kit.Still won't change my rating, this was amazing I'm so happy to finally have a black car that actually looks clean when it is.

*UPDATE* after having my first one for several months it has faded to a bronze color. I clean my dash almost ritualistically and do not spend a lot of time in the sunlight directly, so unless it is a fluke, expect a bronze button. Light still functions and aside for the color shift (which luckily isn't super noticeable in my trucks interior) the button is still fantastic. I ordered another button with the pigtail this time and unfortunately the button never arrived (the pigtail did and I really recommend it to save the headache that comes with the buttons small posts), so to save some hassle I just ordered a new one and it came in just as good of condition as the first one.*Original Post*Posts were a bit small but nothing to difficult to work aroundThe light inside is a little bright when driving at night. But that can be good or bad depending on the use.Overall I really like it

I haven't had miles on the seals yet, but they fit an 03-04 CBR 600rr (seals for both forks come in this kit). They look like they'll work great. The dust seals however leave the seal spring exposed, and this makes me think that corrosion will be an issue in the future. I might swap the dust seals out for the OEM style ones.

This stuff was amazing. It was recommended by the guy that inspected my car before I purchased it used. I have a white Yaris and under the door handles there were a bunch of scratches and it was the worst thing about the look of the car. After a few minutes of applying this and some medium pressure it made it look brand new again!

If you're thinking of taking up the ukulele, or buying one as a present, this is a decent instrument with all the accessories you might want at an attractive price. The ukulele itself has a pleasant tone, is easy to play, and the intonation is spot-on, which means it'll play in tune as you move up the neck. A lot of budget instruments have a problem there. The top appears to be made of solid wood- unusual at this price level. It's strung with Nylgut strings, a nice plus, and there's a complete spare set of Nylguts as well. You also get a neck strap, a tuner, a polishing/cleaning cloth,  a pick of the proper thickness, and an attractively embroidered bag to keep everything in. Add a copy of one of Jumpin' Jim's ukulele songbooks and you're good to go.  (I received a free sample instrument for review, but so far as I can tell it wasn't specially selected in any way and showed no sign of being previously played.)

I purchased 2 x T10 Wedge 5-SMD 5050 LED Light bulbs W5W 2825 158 192 168 194 (Green) by Hogin Corp. The lights came fast, on time, and well packaged. The lights are well made with no parts being loose or falling off. The body of the light is sturdy and fits well into the socket. Each bulb has 5 LED bulbs, 4 on each side and 1 in front. The color of the light is lights green, similar to the green light at the stop light. The lights are much brighter then the original lights and do not have a yellowish hint in them. These LEDs use less energy then the regular bulbs and do not get as warm as other lights. I am really enjoying them.On picture I have a green little light on drivers side while same kind white LED on the passengers side for comparison.I would like to disclose that I did receive this product at a discounted price for the unbiased and honest opinion and was not compensated in any other way.

In the product Note it states that this is a "Greasable Super Strength" part when in fact it is not, it may be super strength, but it is not greasable.  Personally I prefer u-joints that can be greased after installation, where these you cannot.  I will use these since I do not have the time to wait for replacements, but I will not recommend these or buy these again.  If you do not mind not being able to grease u-joints after installation, then these will work just fine.

Installed the light bar tonight and so far it looks nice and seems bright. Wiring harness is a little short and pretty skimpy on the conductor size but these are low draw lights so it might be just fine. Light feels heavy for what it is, cast aluminum housing. I used the wiring harness and just added on when needed and used my own rocker switch. The harness is set up for two lights so I just taped off the second set of connectors for now. The light did show up very fast compared to its estimated arrival time. Will test drive it for awhile and check back after a few months use. It is going on my commuter car that is driven about 100 miles each way to work in the early morning hours, look for the update

Very bright lights, and had a very easy install. The hardest part of the entire install was figuring out where I wanted to mount the lights. Nice illuminated switch (while on) and wiring, and instantaneous lights (as expected with LEDs), much faster than HID cold starts.Mine are mounted on/in the front bumper of my '13 WRX, and I pointed them ahead about 50 feet and outward toward the ditches/edge of the road. Was debating getting a set of floods for extra lighting, but settled on a 40" lightbar instead... Should get interesting, lol. This is a great product, with VERY high quality.

I ordered this to replace a burned out center brake light on a 1999 Chevy Suburban.  It was received within the 2 days as promised.  I was somewhat hesitant about ordering it because of the mixed reviews, but most of the poor reviews seemed to have to do with the way it fit on other vehicles.  This unit fits perfectly on a 99 Suburban, and therefore, I expect that it will fit on Tahoe's and Suburbans having the same body style as the 99 Suburban.  It's exactly the same size and shape as the OEM unit that came off the vehicle.  It comes with a small "jumper" type wiring harness that was not needed on the 99 Suburban.  The electrical connector on the light fit right into the vehicle wiring harness connector.  The unit comes with a cone shaped rubber grommet on the wire, but it has a split in it so that it can be easily removed.  It was not needed on my installation.  One difference between this unit and the OEM unit is that this light has only 15 LEDs, while the OEM unit has 30 LEDs.  However, looking at the light output in the daylight, the new light seems to be plenty bright.  I don't know if the LEDs in the new unit are brighter than the LEDs in the old unit, because my old unit was not working and I couldn't compare them.  I have only had this unit illuminated long enough to make sure that it works, but it seems to be fine so far.  I also noticed that the black plastic end caps on the new unit seemed to be just pushed into the body of the light, without being firmly attached.  However, when I removed the OEM unit, I found it to be made the same way.  I'll update this review if anything changes.  I gave it 4 stars only because I wish it had 30 LEDs like the original, other than that. it seems perfect.  One of the attached photos shows the new light installed on the vehicle, with the old light sitting on to of it for comparison purposes.

Ok, here is my honest review.This product is good as far as camouflaging the scratch or tear on leather furniture. But it is very hard to match the correct color unless you have a solid color ( ie: white, black, red...), if your color falls in between you will a hard time getting the right color to match perfectly. My couch is tan, and I had to mix white and brown just like the instruction says, but I could never get it to match, I had to add some black to the mix to get it as close as possible (see attached pictures)

Barely fits onto OEM harness (concerned about water/shortages) and is dimmer than the cheap xenon bulbs currently installed. I wasted my little free time i have installing these and still end up losing out on $5 to pay for return shipping! I'm going to spend the extra cash to get a better product! The "yellow 3k" is not a true 3000k temperature color but just a yellowish tint on the bulb.2001 Chevrolet Tahoe 5.3L 4WD LT

I purchased these LED's for my side markers on my 03 Honda Civic. I was very happy after I installed these lights as they are extremely bright. I previously had some other amber led''s in my side markers that weren't nearly as bright. The color on these lights paired with my amber housing side markers makes it a deep and bright amber color and looks very nice. The bulbs themselves seem to be quality made and unlike other bulbs with the thin wire end connections, these ones have a flat metal connection on each side which makes them much more durable. So far, no complaints on these bulb's.

Upgraded from Two-horn set-up to Three Trumpet with two compressors: impressed how clean the sound is and definitely loud in conjunction with Wolo stock-horn. Shipping fast, although, Amazon Ad, via Seller, does not state free-shipping outside 48 States:  price-point of horn kit, sound-quality, and ease of installation worth $22.00 shipping cost.At the same time, instructions read, no need to use relay with stock-horn-output, however, you may want to use included relay (as I did) for full 30 AMP out-put.

Works great. Couldn't wait a min after it arrived to try it. It sure does make the leather softer. I read some complaints about it not doing that and I highly think it's due to the quality of your leather. There are many different grains and quality of leather, and if you get a cheaper one and apply things to it to make it look more expensive I highly doubt it will. For me it worked great. It brought back the softness it lost and gave it a hydrated look. It's a creamy solution that needs to be buffed in. I put two coats on and it drank it like water. My jacket was thirsty. It has no smell or Oder that will linger around. I did my jacket and shoes.

Easy to install on an R1200GSW using a Denali light bar with DRL controller to provide power.  They turn on automaticaly when the bike starts and turn off after 30 secs when the engine stops.  Been using them for about three months without any issues.  I applied amber/yellow film from Lamin-x over the lens for the "fog light" look and to increase conspicuity during daytime use.  I was not interested in additional lighting for night driving so I cannot comment how bright they in the dark.

Oh. My. God. What can I say. Jet Seal and Pete's 53, when combined, will give you the best protection and shine outside of giving your car a ceramic coating. I use a high concentration of CG's Citrus wash&gloss shampoo to make sure to remove any existing coat of wax. Once the car is dry I come back with a clay bar to remove any remaining particulates trapped on the clear coat, and to give the car that smooth mirror finish. I then apply a thin coat of Jet Seal using a MF pad, let it sit for at least 15 minutes, and then come back and wipe off the haze with a MF towel. While JS gives you a nice gloss, it's not as good as a high quality carnauba wax. And that's where Pete's 53 carnauba wax comes in. I apply this wax right after I wipe off the haze from the JS. The result is outstanding!

Mothers makes dependable well priced products. This kit worked decently but it left things lacking. I have a black 2006 Volvo S60R. It has been babied this past year (I've owned it for a month now), but in full sun and up close, you can tell it's almost 12 years old. I did things a bit backwards and waxed it the moment I got it (CarGuys liquid wax), and it shines like hell but the finish was still a bit rough and the amount of metallic in the black sapphire paint actually accentuates instead of hides swirls, scratches, etc.This kit will likely only last you a single venture. The clay bars are very small. The spray bottle pretty much ran out right at the end. To be fair I was working in a do-it-yourself car wash so I could wash before and after and the wind was howling non-stop so that likely 50% of the spray didn't get to lay on the car anyway. But regardless, I wouldn't count on getting two goes from one bottle much less these two tiny bars. The kit was easy to use and comes with an absorbant wiping cloth as well. My only beef with the cloth is the huge Mother's branded tag on it.I will say this made a noticeable difference in the slick/smoothness of the pain but I can still feel some imperfections, I likely needed to start out with a higher grade and work down to finer versions. Still, the beading and gleam after just clay barring and pre-second wash was impressive. It did catch on some of the rougher plastic body kit panels and where there's a deep scratch on one trim panel, but it cleaned up easily.The finish I got after re-waxing after using this kit was noticeably improved, scratches etc still visible but the finish was such a smooth glossy sheen even in cloudy/overcast/darkening light.Considering I find it even harder to take my eyes off my car, I'd say this product is worth it. I'm not 100% satisfied with either Mothers or Meguire's but until I find a kit with a bigger volume of cleaner and larger bars for a similar price, I'll keep buying this twice a year.

I did not go though the trouble of swapping out the switchblade key.  The key has two halves, the half with the switchblade key and chip, and the half with the remote control and keyring.  All I did was swap the guts of the remote into the new remote half, and attach it to the old switchblade half.  Now my key attaches to my keychain again and the buttons aren't cracked and broken.  It seems to work great and took 5 minutes.

I already had a great finish so maybe that's why. But I can honestly say after using this that I really couldn't tell a difference. Maybe black light is awesome because it's a black car but there's only so much you can do with a white finish it seems. You can buy this if you'd like, i'm sure it does SOMETHING, but nothing that stands out to me to warrant its $23 price tag. BUT I WILL SAY... it's incredibly easy to apply then remove. And it smells amazing like cotton candy and I want to eat my car.UPDATE.. the pics taken with the garage door open the following day showed the true results of the work. But this is after v36 buff, white light, jet Seal, and double coat collinite wax. I'm not exactly sure how much of this shine or mirror I can attribute to the white light. But that combination of steps has definitely added some shine.

I thought I would try these super-cheap bulbs before plunking down $75 for a pair of proper Phillips bulbs. They work, and seem to be just as bright as the previous Phillips bulbs. Time will tell how long they last.However, I had a frustrating fitment problem that took some time and studying to resolve. The three little nibs that are on the black plastic mating surface of the bulb (see attached photo) were too long, and made the bulb protrude slightly from its socket preventing the securing ring from screwing on. Looking at the old bulb I saw the problem and simply filed down the three nibs. Then they fit perfect. Because of the extremely tight space I was cursing like a drunk sailor trying to install the new bulbs!

Fit nice on my new 2016 Sierra. I went ahead and put a thin coat of marine grease around the perimeter before shoving them in. Should help seal them, and also helped to get them in all the way without having to whack them with anything. Not a glamorous thing that most people will even notice but good, cheap protection. The frame tubes look like they would otherwise trap dirt and road salt.

4755 does a good job of trapping oil/water. My use is pretty light duty as I'm just drying off cars after a wash. Be careful not to step on 4755 as the barrel is made of plastic and very fragile. I stepped on mine and it split in two. And use the filter "downstream" meaning as far away from the compressor as possible. Mine is attached to an air wand.

These are the best. I ordered 4 for my 2017 Ram 1500. Installation is a little tedious, but save yourself the $ on the router bit set and just cut out the required plastic on the bed rails with a utility knife and a couple fresh blades.I used these with a truxedo lo-pro tonneau cover and had plenty of room for the regular bull rings instead of the chrome flush mount ones, which in my opinion stand out way too much against the black rail caps. These original bull rings have the textured black plastic caps that match and are slightly raised, which just look so much better.I've used them more than I thought I would when I got them for ratcheting down light to medium loads. They are life savers for strapping across the top!Take your time on the install, and these things should last a lifetime.

With my 5th wheel trailer attached, my truck (2016 Ford F-250) squatted noticeably, pushing the bed of the truck down roughly 3 inches.  So thought I'd give the Timbrens a try to help with leveling.  They are definitely an improvement and it cut down the squatting by half (1.5 inches) and the ride is noticeably smoother.  I have not felt the impact of the empty ride as some have mentioned.  I would definitely recommend these as a cheaper alternative to airbags.

This stuff is a miracle cleaner for my Softail Slim, if you ask me. My bike is charcoal and black with a black frame, oil tank, and black engine. Plus, I have lots of chrome (see pics). This stuff is amazing. I originally used it for my black engine but started using it on everything black on my bike (except my tank and fenders because I have an Xcel scratch protective film on them and have specific agents to clean it).After it did such a great job on my engine, I started using it on everything black. My handlebars, frame, oil tank, fender struts, cables,  sissy bar, etc. It gives everything black a new life! Now my bike's only 8 months old, but black just gets dirty. My parts have never looked so good. I just ordered my second can because my first is almost empty (I went a little crazy cleaning my bike). I usually just spray it on and don't care about overspray on the chrome because that also seems to have a shine when I do. I do, however, spray it on a microfiber cloth if something is close to my leather or Xcel film. I can't say enough about this product. Hopefully it stays around for awhile. I may just buy a case of it to be sure!

Quality tool from OTC.  Very heavy and appears very well made.  Will put it to work soon and add notes on use.The main "C" portion of the tool is cast with 'Made in USA'.  The storage container label also identifies 'Made in USA'  None of the smaller cup/receiver/plates are marked with any country of origin.Update - Just used it to install Ball Joints in a Dodge 3500 - worked flawlessly!  The center bolt uses a 13/16 socket.  I used a long 1/2 breaker bar and socket to turn the center bolt and was able to remove some really stubborn ball joints.  Quality tool - no bending/flexing.

I like the way they look on my Mercedes. They are a little less durable I feel then original OEM.Mercedes. Seller took a long period of time to get order to me, over two weeks. I planned on getting them installed with my new tires, however due to not arriving on time it did not work out. I had to pay my tire installer for a separate  charge of $30.00 to remove tires and rims and remove original caps and reinstall these new caps. Seller said it could be done other wise by just using a screw driver from front of rim to remove old centers. Installer said this was not the case and the seller is wrong , and cost me $30.00 dollars more. Caps should be installed from back on rim , which can only be done from removing lug nuts and rims. Product does look good on car. Did someone say credit?

Well, after fighting for close to an hour to get the bolt out of the busbing, I finally got it out, I read this fits third and second gens via the comments, I have a second gen with third gen steering linkage, so I figured it'd fit. I did get it to fit after wallowing out one bushing and having to cut the bolt out of the other end. In the end it's not the products fault, more of my fault I guess, I however did get everything to bolt up just fine.

Used this kit to clay bar my 2011 Silverado, and it just works and works well. The clay is a little less abrasive than the Megs kit I used prior to buying this kit. But it works very well if there is not a lot of surface contaminants.

This is a pretty nifty product. It cleared up the rats nest of wires from my previous 6 system setup really nicely under the hood. Its definitely a lot safer then my previous set up. I will suggests connect female ends instead of hard wiring the lights so you have the option of changing out the products. Lets be real, is as jeepers like to change it up with our giant LEGO kits

I bought this LED pack specifically because of the AGT brand.  What arrived are generic LED's in a single pack NOT the 2 per AGT bag (see photo).  Yes, sure the bulbs work and they do what I wanted and they are as technically described (10x 194 168 2825 5-SMD White High Power LED Car Lights Bulb), but they aren't AGT..."10 x Wedge Type Bulbs by AGT packaged 2 per plastic bag (AGT Brand LED bulbs are known for using superior SMD bulbs that perform and last 2x longer than competitor LED bulbs) Be aware of sellers selling NON-AGT brand bulbs. There are cheaper modules on the market they may substitute. AGT bulbs never ship from China."Hmmm - SURE!Note that you will find these are not a tight fit in the holder like the original incandescent bulb and you need to try various bulbs until you get a reasonable fit.  Time will tell how long these cheap presumably Chinese bulbs last.Unfortunately, Amazon seems to be using more and more untrustworthy sources.

Looks good and appears to have repaired the leaks. 5 days after the coating was installed we had a really hard rain and no leaks! I had caulked and replaced the ac gasket in the last 10 months but still had leaks until this was applied.

To CLR619:  My jack lowers to just under 3 3/4 inches.  I have had it fit under an '01 Dyna Street Glide and '05 Dyna Lo Rider with ease.  It is the lowest jack I have found and it is built very sturdily.  Recheck your bike's clearance by actual measurement.  You will get some added clearance by running the front wheel up on a piece of 1x6 or 2x6, also place same thickness under your stand. Good luck.This is my original review:  See extra 2 attached photos.This sturdy jack is perfect for the very low clearance of my 650# Harley Dyna.  I only lifted the front end but feel confident that the jack would easily support the entire bike. The manual lift operation is smooth and tight.  I fixed a 4 x 4 length of wood to one of the extensions at the jack base and attached lashing straps which helped to stabilize the bike.  (Additional lashing straps to ceiling of garage, too). Did not include rebber on the supporting surface so I cut up an old bicycle tube...works fine.  A good purchase.

This is a great product, BUT they definitely were not manafactured well enough to serve their purpose. Do not get me wrong the customer service is amazing and this is a such an affordable DIY modification but unless you have LED headlights or a way to seperate them from the heat of the bulb they will unfortunately melt (see attached photo) the company was nice enough to send a replacement for my halos after they began melting in my headlight which I will install after converting to LED bulbs but as I said before for traditional headlights (or even foglights potentially) this will not last when exposed to heat, the halo itself is intact but the plastic cover for it is what I had begin melting.

What a difference of having a brand new tires. I have a V8 with 4.10 gear ratio and I almost always spin my rear with BGGoodrich g-Force Comp (1st version) rubber on it. This MT reminds me when I had my Nitto NT555R drag radial years ago and that it launches almost the same. I have more confidence during cornering also. I haven't been thru rain yet (it hardly rains in Las Vegas anyways). While this might not be as sticky as the drag radial, however, this will last 3x longer with 300 tread wear compared to 100 in the drag radial. My muscle car is now 15 years old and I've tried a lot of different tires and so far in terms of performance, price, and quality this is the best one. I've colored my tire's letters and the PlastiDip the wheels and I believed it adds more character to the whole car.

This gauge was purchased along with oil temp and transmission temp gauges and is much better than relying on the oil pressure light in the dash. However, the sender is the only thing that keeps this from being perfect. The VDO-style sender started failing after 4 months of use, and its odd resistance range (3-160) compared to other senders means that replacements can only be sourced from GlowShift or Prosport. Save yourself the hassle of getting a warranty replacement for the sender as those can be found on the cheap. Other than this issue, the looks and other features of this gauge (such as the dimming and color choices) make it a pretty good bargain.

Stay away from these unless you want problems.Mcgard claims "Every McGard wheel lock is fully machined from restricted chemistry steel made specifically for McGard and through-hardened for its unsurpassed level of security".  Well the unsurpassed level of security is true for the wheel lug lock, but not so for the lug key.I HAD these on a Dodge Ram 1500 and the lug key broke while changing out a flat- not once, but on 3 different subsequent occasions.  Luckily for me the first one that came with my truck brand new broke after I put the spare tire on while tightening the wheel lug lock back on.  I figure no big deal, it could have been worst.  At least Im no stranded somewhere in inclement weather.  So I had to go through McGard's customer service department to order a replacement lug key at approximately $15 (plus shipping if you want it expedited).  After 2 weeks go by, it finally arrived.  I never really inspected it when the replacement one arrived; rather I just tossed it in my glove box.  About 2 months later, when I needed it for the first time, the replacement lug key also snapped.  Except this time I had a leaking tire that would not hold air for more than a day, which I was attempting to take off.  Well once again I was on the phone with McGard customer service, ordering a new lug key.  They refused to replace the one they sent me at no cost, so I was stuck paying another $15 for a second replacement lug key.  Again, I waited about 2 weeks for it to arrive because I was not about to spend another $30 for them to overnight it to me.  After 2 weeks it arrived, and I was able to remove the leaking tire.  I then go to remove another wheel, which was the temporary spare from a couple months ago, and this second replacement key snapped.  I couldn't believe it.  Three keys breaking like this in about as many months with the last 2 being ordered back-to-back.  The third time was it for me.  No more McGard!!!  I decided not to order another one at cost and wait another unreasonable amount of time for shipping since there was no guarantee it wouldnt happen again.  Besides McGards customer service seemed to care less about the issue altogether.I decided to break the lug locks off manually without a key.  See my very basic instructions at the end of this review if you are interested.  It is a bit of work but can be done if you are in a situation where you cannot or do not want to wait.  With the proper tools, patience and muscle I was able to remove all 3 (the 1st one came off with the 3rd lug key before it broke) in about an hour with no damage to my wheels or the studs.  Costs to me were about $15 for 2 deep well 12-point sockets which became ruined in the process, plus my time.  The net-net here is no more dealing with McGard, and risking being stuck in a bad situation.Now some may say the lug locks must have been put on too tight, however that was not the case.  I tighten all my lug nuts and lug locks by hand with a torque wrench.  In this particular application, specs call for 135 ft-lbs per lug nut, however with the lug locks I go much less at 90 ft-lbs (as a precautionary measure).My conclusion is the metal they are using for these lug keys are of cheap grade, and too malleable for its purpose.  They quite possibly have a quality control issue in their production machine shop and or the manufacturing of these for it to be a repetitive problem as I experienced.  My advice, if you must have lug locks, I highly recommend you go with the spline type.Here are some basic instructions if you break your key or lost it and want to remove the lug locks yourself.  Be advised this may not work on all vehicles, and or may cause damage.1. The McGard lug locks have an outer cylindrical band that spins on them so you cannot simply grab onto the outside perimeter of the lug lock to loosen them.  For instance bolt extractors or specialty wrenches will not work.  For this reason you will first need to remove this outer metal band.  Take a thin flat head screw driver or similar flat tool like a small chisel and hammer in between this outer metal band and the lug lock inner nut.  If you look closely the outside edge of the lug lock has a bit of a raised lip, but with some persistence and a steady hand you can get it in there by tapping with a hammer.  Once in, keep hitting lightly while trying to pry it apart.2. Once the metal band breaks apart, and you can easily remove it by hand or with needle nose pliers3. Now take a deep well 12-point socket, sized smaller than the diameter of the lug lock, and hammer it on with a sledge hammer.  Make sure it mashes down enough on top of the lug lock that it bites into the outer edge lip that I mentioned in step 1.4. Take your breaker bar, attached to the socket mashed onto the lug lock and now attempt to break it loose.5. If the socket spins, without biting into the lug lock nut, then you will either need to beat the socket on further so it covers the portion of the lug lock where it raises back out (becomes wider) just past where the outer metal band was removed.  Or alternatively, you will need to remove the socket and replace with the next size down and repeat from step 3 until it bites into the lug lock bolt enough so it can be loosened from the bolt studs.

I ordered these for my 99 Tahoe to put in the HVAC system controls. I do believe it took all 6 of them. They look awesome. Easy to install. I ordered these with the Partsam 10 Pack PC168 T10 Twist Lock Blue T10 168 Led Cluster Gauge Dash Light Bulb+ 10 Pcs  for my dash.. Honestly the colors of blue are a bit off. The ones I ordered for my dash are slightly more purple...not that big of deal but you can see the difference. I uploaded a video found here at Amazon http://smile.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TR83VXFW4PKV/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVC78RU of the lights. Like others have said if you install them and they don't work, flip them around in the socket as they do have a positive and negative. I have had these in for a few months and have no flicker or burn out issues as of now.IMPORTANT NOTE:  These are not able to be dimmed. Neither the dash nor the hvac can be dimmed using the dimmer on your light switch. They just turn off and on. Its not a big deal for me as I don't dim mine but you should know. You can see that in my video as well that I linked.

I put this on a 2013 CBR500RA and it works great.  I've had it on and off several times - takes about 5 minutes to reinstall.  It's a good fit for this bike, as it's quite clear of the exhaust.  I found that if I slip the rear velcro strap past the passenger seat, then unstrap the front strap, it allows access to the storage space under the passenger seat.  The bags don't have to be removed when doing this - a big plus.  I'm surprised at how much stuff you can get in these bags!  I've carried 4, 2 litter soft drink bottles in them.

This light looks great but it gives off a very disappointing amount of light. Even with high beam on and adjusted a million times to try and improve, it just doesn't provide like I feel it should. Way less than factory bulb but it is LeD and looks way better. If you ride at night frequently on back roads or unlit areas, get a different light

I ALWAYS buy JDM ASTAR led bulbs. I had several of them on my Mustang and purchased these for my 2005 BMW 330ci to upgrade my reverse lights. They work perfect and are easily a dozen times brighter than the factory incandescent bulbs.What's better is that aside from getting a high quality bulb every time, I almost always get them ahead of estimated delivery date!I will never buy another led bulb. Cost effective and reliable!

These Zone Tech Universal fit gray floor mats were bought for a Toyota Highlander- I would consider these mid grade mats, I have seen a lot worse and I have seen a lot better- These seemed like they had been sitting in a warehouse or a container ship a long time.The front mats fit ok-  they could have been wider but the length was good-The middle row fit good- The third row these were way too big-, although these are trimmable- I would have butchered them down to noting- so I didn't cut them,  but I was able to put in the front row ofa 2005 Ford F-250 Super Duty ex cab-They arrived looking a big stained up and dirty- but I knew they were just going to get dirty anyway- so it was ok with me- they had been folded on hanging devices and apparently for a while- it took a couple days for the fold hump to go away - one of the little plastic hanger parts was icky and either melted on or glued on- but came off pretty easy- but left a icky residue I had to clean off for fear if it getting on someone's feet-I had the opportunity to review this product at a discounted cost for testing, inspecting and reviewing. I was not compensated and am not required to write this review and this is my opinion based on my experience with this product. I hope you have found my review was helpful!

Update: Although the manufacturer offered to work things out it's too much hassle but I am adding a star to the review because the smell vanished in one or two weeks (I realized yesterday that I hadn't felt it in a while). It serves the purpose of protecting my trunk from saltwater and, had it been 10 inches longer, I would have given it 4 stars...Too bad.I got this because I often go surf fishing and I didn't want the sand and even saltwater from the bait bucket to be all over the original carpet. This liner partially (VERY partially) covers the trunk but I'll keep it just so I don't go through the hassle of returningPROS:- price- next day delivery- colorCONS:- definitely too short for most sedans (the pic shows a regular 2004 Ford Taurus trunk)- seems very thin- smells horribly

Fits great on an '06 BMW 750LI w/ Ate Calipers. These are for the FRONT brakes. I have yet to break them in but so far they're quiet and the brake feel is nice.The set came with the pads (4) pieces total, lubricant, sticker, and (2) sensors. My car only takes one... Guess I'll hold on to the other as a spare...?As always, Amazon.com - fast shipping/ great service/ best price!!!

I drive a 2015 Subaru Forester XT Touring, I got these thinking they will help light up the road... But it doesn't... You can't even tell if they're on or not... They " LOOK  " bright, I'm not going to lie about that, they do somewhat match the factory HIDs.. Installing them they just scatter the light all around like a flood light. Doesn't project any usable light... It just looks nice and for those who just want to color match their factory HIDs. First pic shows both LED fog installed, second photo shows factory bulb on the left and LED fog on the right

Installed on 2004 Ram 1500 Quad Cab. Appears to be a well built cover. Installation went fairly easy. Installed some of the extra supplied weatherstrip across the front of the cover. The cover did not fit the contour of the bed as I had wanted. It sticks out on each corner at the tailgate. Also the combination lock will probably be a little awkward using.

The package arrived promptly. The box had the sensor, U-clip and O ring. It has everything you need. I waited until the car was cold, removed the radiator cap to release pressure and easily replaced the sensor. Anti-Freeze didn't leak. It's a simple fix! I will update my rating once I am sure the trouble code is fixed.Update: After driving my 2000 VW Jetta 2.0L, the temperature would go above the 190 mark and would go down randomly. It's not reliable and I replaced it with another sensor that was a bit more expensive that resolved the issue. The sensor is cheap. Save yourself the time and get another. Also, it's not the same shade of green as the OEM part.

I am in the early stages of evaluating it.  I have 2 cars, a 2001 Lexus that has gone 250k miles and a 2011 Honda that as 100k.  I want to keep both cars longer and have maintained them well.  I reached out to the customer service for more info about Cleanboost and they responded promptly.  They even anticipated my questions and provided proof of how it keeps the fuel system clean.  I am attaching their flyer about it.  I've seen the various reviews, including those on youtube.  My main goal is to maintain my engine, keep the fuel system clean, and keep my cars running smoothly longer.  I believe this will be one of the products that will help me towards that goal.

Easy install. Came with all the hardware needed. Doesn't have any kind of cleats on it for ratchet straps or bungee chords (only negative).  The tops crossbar is adjustable for height with a high or low setting. The instructions mention having to drill holes in the brackets themselves for mounting to the car but they might be old because mine had the holes all pre cut only had to drill holes in the truck.

I Installed this into my 2008 Mercury Sable Premier. Let's just say, they weren't the most cooperative company I've ever had the opportunity of dealing with. This product is NOT designed for my vehicle and I was aware of this when purchasing. I specialize in automotive electronics. I have access to iDentiFix, an online resource for diagrams and everything else you could every imagine for nearly every car manufacturer. I've spent the time to figure out their entire wiring harness and mine. All I wanted to do was submit a "Alternative Minor-Mod" option to allow more vehicles to match the same application. NOPE.

Can't beat the price!Arrived in two-days with Prime free shipping and I did a driveway install, as I've installed leveling kits before.  Installation on my 2016 F-150 took about a total of 3 hours. (1.5 hrs for each side) and so far the ride is the same with no issues. (crossing my fingers)They are made out of T6 aircraft billet and the finish seems to be good.Once installed on a 2016 F-150, you can't see the spacer, which makes it look as if the truck is already leveled.The tricky part on my installation was getting the strut assembly back into the shock tower mount and the lower spline bolts of the strut assembly.But other than that, I reused my stock shocks and it was an easy install with perfect fitment.After install, went to get an alignment which was not too far off.  The next day I put new rims & tires, replacing the OEM ones.Again...You can't beat the price for the same product that has the same purpose as some of the more expensive ones out there.

I sprayed Mother's Leather Cleaner on my $5000.00 leather FlexSteel couch and it instantly took the color out! This is horrible crap.  I figured that leather cleaner would be good on leather.  Apparently I'm badly misinformed! This stuff shouldn't be sold to anyone.  The container says the "Manufacturer's liability limited to replacement of product or refund of purchase price upon return of unused portion and proof of purchase."  So, basically, there is no warranty for things they ruin.I will post a photo showing the arm of my couch.  My advice is to never even consider buying this crap!

Perfect for Jeep drivers that take the doors off, but still want to see blind spots.  Just stick them on the back of the side air vents, they are rimless and still allows you to adjust them when the doors are on. Just don't use the black plastic piece that comes with the mirrors. Good quality real glass and 3M double stick tape.

This is Simply AMAZING.I used to use Mobil 1 high mileage 5W-30 on my 2002 camry 2.4 liter 4cylinder engine.Usually, I could drive 360 miles after refuel til top of the tank. (It takes 15gallons for the full tank)Sometimes 370miles ish.It's not really affected by gas brands.Ex) Quick stop, Safeway, 76, Chevron, Valrero and so on.I could feel less or no 'ticking' sound with Chevron gas (also pretty depends on each gas station gas quality)but barely affected on gas mileage.I drained old one and filled up the Liquimoly oil yesterday. Replaced oil filter as Bosch product.Today, I got more than 406 miles total drive distance.From 360miles to 406 mile in 15gallons of fuel.Even the gas was 'Flying J' brand.(I'm sorry Flying J)Anyway! 24mpg -> 27mpg!3mpg increased!!The acceleration is smoother and little bit greater(not a performance car;;)I definitely recommend to anyone looking for the best engine oil product.Let me update what I feel and How much MPG I get.Ps. It is certified API product.more information link below.Thanks.

Prime choice is the only choice. Best product I've received for my 2003 S-10 EXT V6. I'm replacing the whole front end on my truck. Restoring it back to what it was back in 2003. If your having trouble getting to the bolts on the back of the upper control arm (18mm bolt and a 22mm Screw). Buy or get stubby wrenches to get back there and they fit back there perfect to get to those bolts and be sure to count the shimes on the upper control arm or your alignment will be off if you don't put the shimes back were they were. Any questions about doing it, send a message and I'll be more then happy to answer what you need for what part. I just got done doing the driver and passenger side this weekend. Started on the driver side, took me 2 hours to disassemble the whole driver side. Since I knew what to do and what bolts were what sizes, it took me 45 mins to do the passenger side Sunday.

2007 WRX VF43 swap Sedan.I bought this to use with a recirculation kit supposedly made by HKS.  And really my beef is with the mounting adapter and the recirc adapters that just do not fit.But on my STI intercooler, this valve gets in the way, it can only sit one way, and that way (outlet to the driver side) I will never be able to recirc it.  The recirc adapter I bought it 2mm too long in the housing to allow me to bolt the cover back on with stock hardware. (the screws are not long enough to thread.)  The vacuum line is too long and rests on a fuel line when it is installed.  And the adapter plate is too thin to use the stock bolts with, they bottom out in the IC.  Glad I saw that before driving them home and ruining my IC.  Perhaps if the adapter plate was the correct depth, the valve would not interfere so much with the rest of the setup allowing for more range of motion.But now I am at the end of my build and have to rethink my life choices because of a poor fitting part.  I think the Perrin or Greddy one would fit better with the space available.<Update>  Housing hits mounting adapter preventing it to seal the C Clip properly.  My first full boost run I shifted and thought my motor blew up.  "You'll shoot your eye out" repeating in my head as I coasted to a stop.  I pop the hood expecting to find nothing, and find the BOV sitting on top of the radiator.  1 assorted size O-ring kit and 3 cheap c-clip pliers and I get it back on... to find out why it blew off.  I then had to remove my TMIC splitter insert and turn the BOV straight up and down so I could limp it back to my shop for further investigation.  Removed valve and plate, and found that the lip around the valve makes contact with the mounting plate.  I ground down that lip a tad and remounted - fits and works now... but still think I should have gone with a top hat looking style.  Looking at the pics I have posted, you can see the vacuum nipple will make contact with the fuel lines on the driver side, and the throttle body connector on the passenger side, and the PCV tube on the TMIC.  The nipple has to bee in the gap between the TB and the PCV tube, and allows for about 5 degrees of movement.  This then puts the lip/ridge over the adapter plate, where it makes contact.  I will probably replace it later after I get some use out of it.  You can see on the pad under the hood and the plastic fan shroud where the valve made contact.  I am glad it did not hit my brand new radiator.  I ordered a new C clip and o-ring to have in my glove box just in case.

Item arrived promptly. Opened the package to see they even ship it with Teflon tape to seal the fittings. Only one problem... I was unable to get the two hose barbs out with a wrench. When it required a little more effort. I got concerned. I can only assume the fittings were over tightened on installation and galled. Please see photos.

Absolutely awesome! It is the perfect size, mounts easily and seems to be of a very high quality and heavy materials including very heavy duty zippers. It attached quickly to the Sissy Bar back rest and luggage rack of my 2006 Honda Shadow Aero. It comes with tons of mounting straps for connecting to other luggage and a removable handle to carry it inside when you park. I was able to easily fit an entire change of clothes in it with room left over for much more. The main compartment also has lockable zippers and this product includes the removable rain cover. This is a very rigid bag as per their claims.UPDATE JULY 8th, 2016SO I have had the bag about 2 months and have literally only used it for ONE week during these last two months. Even then, it does not stay on my bike but comes off and is stored inside in AC and climate controlled area. IT has already produced TWO signifigant wear areas on the bag from the DOWCO supplied straps for tying it down to the luggage rack.This is highly disappointing and of course, the return window is now closed on Amazon (go figure). I really like this bag and it seems very well constructed except for this one issue.

I expected this keychain to be flat on one side, but it is 3D on both sides and made of solid metal.  It is not heavy so it won't cause damage to your ignition switch.  The perfect size and shiny - made for a pony lover for sure!Since it is covered in shiny chrome finish, it will get some scuffs marks from hitting against your keys.

I worked for a jaguar repair shop on the east coast about 10 years ago. We used berkebile gum cutter for everything. The cans are smaller than some of the big name brands, but it lasts longer because it works and you don't need as much to do the job. I've never found another product that works as well as this stuff. You definitely want to use it in a ventilated area because this stuff would drive California ecomentalists nuts. Its a little bit expensive but I'm glad to pay it to an American company that makes a product that works.

These mats fit my 2017 Honda Accord almost perfectly.  Warming them up in the sun allowed me to fine mold them into place.  The only thing I had to do was cut out the two openings on the driver's side for the gas/truck latch and the trunk lock.  The one-piece rear mat it excellent.  See pics below.  I highly recommend these mats ESPECIALLY if you have kids!

Disappointing, to say the least. I tried them with the LED's both vertical and horizontal in the projector housing and they just won't cut it up against H9 Halogen lamps. Side-by-side you can barely see the light on my garage door in the daytime. For something that's rated to put out over twice the lumens as an H9, this is in send-them-back-today territory.

The Best and Realest looking carbon fiber vinyl! Have been told it looks just like the real thing and cant even tell the difference!!! All the reviews that say negative things are people who do not know how to properly wrap. This vinyl sticks perfectly. Just add heat and it's pretty easy to work with! Would def order again! My pics say it all!

Was sent a defective tire with a tread bulge, likely a broken belt. The manufacturing quality is poor. Invest in a better brand. The sidewalls looked bad when they were new (nylon bits visible), I doubt they will last even 10k miles.UPDATE:The Nankang tires I had still in the back, were at ~20k miles, just kissing the wear bar and had a sidewall blowout. Sorry, I just can't recommend or buy these tires again for a car my kids drive in.

Excellent item!  I love this black alcantara (fake suede) Type-r style shift boot with red stitching.  It is soft and feels ultra-nice yet durable, is stitched nicely and installs just like factory.  I figured since my car had cloth seats, changing the OEM faux leather shift knob to this alcantara (more cloth-like feel) made sense.  And I love the results.  You won't be disappointed with this.

Easier and less rewarding than other reviewers make it out to be. Dont bother with the fancy suggested-by-reviewers tools like clamps and hooks unless you have weak hands and think you would have trouble working the material.Make sure your stitches line up and keep it tight. Simple stuff.Would have paid more for nicer leather. This stuff is pretty decent and pretty much any leather was going to look high end in my camaro interior but this stuff would be a joke in any italian car.Overall it's worth the price and time and I AM happy with it.

EDIT: Works as advertised now. The instructions were wrong and the polarity was reversed.I bought this for the voltmeter and to charge my cell phone while riding. After installation half of the LEDs for the voltmeter reading are dead as you can see in the picture. This thing is made in China and it's wired backwards why in the world would you put the positive side on the spade connection. Of course my 30-day window to return this piece of junk has passed so I'm out 32 bucks. Do not buy, save your money for something better.

Great product! Can't even tell it's there at most angles. If you follow the directions, you'll end up with a great result.  Saved myself a good $1,000 over what the dealership wanted and it was easy to apply.  I did it outside, I would recommend the garage.  The plastic was blowing all over so I had to use the whole roll of tape to keep it in place.  Follow the temperature guidelines for a nice result!!!  Watch the install video on the 3M site a few times.

Update (1/29/18)-I'm dropping this review to 1 star. In the time since my original review, two of the bulbs have failed. I tossed the remainder of the bulbs in the trash and replaced them with a different design/manufacturer.I see on the product information page that these bulbs are no longer available. I consider that a very good thing.Original Review:I just installed these in my 2004 Nissan Frontier and they look really good!(This would be a 5-star review if they were brighter...)I wasn't sure if they would work, but I took the risk. You need to pry the old incandescent bulbs out of the twist-lock base to make it work. The only 'Amazon' official' replacement I could find was the Dorman 639-010, but these T5 bulbs fit into the same base. I used a push-pin to help work the incandescent bulbs loose.These LED bulbs are sensitive to polarity... Don't put everything back together until you test them!  If they don't light on the first try, just pull them from the base and rotate 180-degrees. That should get them light up.These same bulbs also fit the turn signal pods on your instrument panel bezel! The blue LED's yield a blue-green color in the green OEM housing, but they are plenty bright. You may as well try them out while you have your dash pulled apart. After all, they give you 10 bulbs and you only need 3 for the instrument cluster. Swapping the turn-signals still leaves you 5 for spares.

They are working great in my 2001 Grand Cherokee. My only issue is I ordered 4300k, the sticker on the bulb said 4300k but they have a blue tint to them, not really the color temp I was going for.

I've always used the basic pen-looking pressure gauge before I was able to purchase and try out this item. Before I give my thoughts, let me say that although I received a broken product, the seller was very friendly and sent out a working replacement at no charge and very fast. Here are my thoughts:PROS:~ After several uses and comparisons to my standard gauge, I believe this one to be accurate and consistent.~ I love that it "locks" the current pressure. That can come in handy.~ Measures pressure quickly and easily.~ Black material is a rubber grip.~ Priced well to the competition.~ No battery needed, unlike electronic gauges.~ Fits nicely in your hand.CONS:~ Does not include a case. I can see this being an issue if it is ever dropped on the plastic front.~ No way to let air out of your tire like some gauges provide. This was a little disappointing. Although I did notice most electronic gauges do not have this feature as well. My pen-like gauge does however.Overall I'm happy with this gauge. It's quick and easier to read than the cheap basic gauges. I wish it came with a case and the ability to let out air, but the description does not mention these features so I won't knock a star.I was provided this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my testing and writing an honest, unbiased review based on my experiences with the item. All of these opinions are my own and have not been influenced, modified, or edited in any way by the vendor.

I have to admit, I am very pleased with the the design, fit and finish of the product. It is not only unique but well done. Why the 4 stars then? Well I am glad you asked. The mount does not have any type of rubber gasket or grommets for the mounting bolts so you are mounting metal to painted metal. No thanks. Prior to final installation I grabbed some automotive lens repair tape (the stretchy stuff) and applied a strip to the back of each mount, trimming with an exacto. If they include some type of gasket, grommet or protection I will easily give this mount 5 stars!

Perfect for my 08 F-150.  The white is VERY bright; estimate 700 lumens and the yellow is just about the same 600 lumens.  The color temperature is that "daylight" (6000k ish) keep that in mind if matching other bulbs. Photos are on a fixed shutter speed and exposure are fixed compared to one another (should be easy to tell the difference).

This is a very good product.  I have an 09 silverado which has a 15 inch steering wheel and a grip of 3.75 inches.  The only one i could find was a synthetic one that was 60 bucks so I ordered this one and trimmed off 1/16 to an 1/8th of an inch off each side and then sewed it tight.  I am very happy with the finished product.  I used a baseball stitch, which their was more than enough thread for.  The needles worked great, bent one on the last spoke because it was so tight i was really fighting to get the needle through the holes at the end.  I read another review where someone drilled out the holes, i didn't bother and never had to use any tools to pull the needles through at all.  Only other thing i did was put a dab of superglue on the knots at the end.  I used this on an 09 silverado but i would imagine that it would work (with modification) on most of the NBS and NNBS silverado and sierra trucks or anything else that has a 3.75 inch grip.

I'm a weekend mechanic and I bought this on prime day because it was on sale.  A few weeks later I had a flat on my 3/4 ton 4x4 Dodge Truck. My tire was completely empty and it filled up from 0 to 50 PSI super fast- about 2mins.  From 50 to 60 PSI I noticed is slowed down some. This compressor is awesome, it's very compact but super powerful. It's versital I even used it to inflate a raft as well.  I think I'm going to buy one of their commercial units and get rid of my gas compressor all together.  I'm giving this 5 stars but I just want to warn everyone this unit gets very very hot, if you touch the housing after it's been running you will get burned (you can fry an egg on this guy) I keep it in the bed of my truck so it has time to cool down, I suggest getting a metal case to store it in.

I've had experience with a few other kits, but this led kit is amazing. The led pods are very bright and we'll constructed. The kit came with more than enough connections, extra 3m adhesive strips (which were the best out of any kit I've ever bought), other miscellaneous things. Fairly easy to assemble, I would recommend getting some 80mm shrink wrap tubing to water seal the connections. Also, a little weird, but the button switch actually doesn't turn the lights on, it turns the box on, and then you have to use the remote to actually turn the lights on, I think it would be better without the switch and just the lights by remote, or have the switch actually turn the led lights on and off. Doesn't really matter as its only a 1sec extra step, just a little confusing why they would make it that wayou. Either way, I'm very happy with the quality, the speed of shipment, and the light output. Definitely recommend.

Bought a set of these to use with a Rho Plate front license plate mount that goes in the tie down bar hole in the bumper.  It is as advertised, thin, strong, nice paint, doesn't block any plate info.  Slightly magnetic, so probably 400 series stainless.Update: after 6 months and one winter, the black finish is peeling off.  Still strong, chrome gloss underneath, but ugly with the peeling.

As a Former MBZ Shop Owner & Interstate Battery Dealer, been using NOCO Corrosion products for @ least 20yrs and it works, as you can see I still have my Noco Treatement Kit and had finally run out of the Old Style Purple B Washers. I realize that these now come in Red/Green but do have the NCP2 Coating  which is far superior than the Standard Flimsy ones, they are also stiffer and thicker. Finally my Sister-in-Law's 5yr old Toyo had a Horrible Corrosion all over the Top of her Bat, I fully Cleaned and Treated it, been over a Month and it has no more issues....

Only 1 point I didn't like about this, the wire and connector coming off the light itself.  Insanely LONG and goofy connector.  Too big for my application.Also not 120W as claimed, only about 80W and color temp is definitely more like 6000k (I have other lighting now that I know for a fact is 5000k as I installed the LEDs in them)That said, I tried one of the cheap china light bars, got sent right back.  Ordered this in its place.  First is that It is actually the spec length.  Perfect fit for my CRV (previous was rated 42 and was only 40 end to end).Next was the build quality, very nice, much more attention to detail.Finally, the light output.  Unlike the china brands, this has a very nice beam pattern.  Strong hot spot but plenty of spill and side coverage.  Light tint (color temp) is about spot on since phillips duplicates car headlight tints and not LED natural light tints.  The china ones are so cool white any dust or moisture they are useless and blinding.  This works just as lights should, be able to see.  And insanely BRIGHT!!!  I have ZXE xenon headlight bulbs and turn them on only way you can tell is below the spot is a bit more lit.  Not sure if lumen claims are true but easily over 10K (I am an LED light nerd).Will be looking at the other lights by these guys when ready to continue.These light bars are easily worth EVERY PENNY.  Time will tell on durability, hope they stand behind warranties if needed.

This 1/2" size is an EXACT perfect fit for fuel hose with Inside Diameter of 5/16" or 8mm. Fuel hoses usually are measured according to their ID, but usually a 5/16 or 8mm ID fuel hose will have OD (outside diameter) of 13mm or 1/2".These size fuel hoses are commonly used on M70 BMW, which is what I used this for.

Installed it on a 2016 dodge ram with 120,000 miles wanted to put this in before my steering components started to fail and create the death wobble. Totally different truck now that this is been installed, nice crisp steering response.  I consistently tow 25,000 pounds with a three car wedge trailer for my business and this is made such a difference. This also seems to reinforce the frame rails at the very front of the truck so Im very happy with the product its heavy duty seam very well-made. Powder coat is flawless and the components are top notch. Installation was simple I did it by myself or use zip ties to hold it up while I put everything in the place it wasn't that hard at all I would give it six stars but they don't have that rating Ive never been dissatisfied with any rough country products don't buy that cheap crappy see anybody that has just the Thin metal tabs welded to it to hold the steering gearbox thats all bull crap this is the real deal.

These will get you seen out in the streets! If any lights hits them they give out a sweet shine! I love it.But two problems the stickers don't actually fully cover the entire warhawk which it was made for they leave a lot of black uncovered but no big deal. And another thing is the price, being what they are they are not worth $18 bucks that's insane. I bought them cause I freak out about been seen out here. So I say get them but don't expect too much and you'll be happy.

I am very picky with my rims. They have to be spotless. The issue I was running into was that I like to clean inside the rim. I had done it with a regular sponge and scraped my hand a couple of times. Next I purchased a Speed Master Wheel Brush and that worked but not to the extent that I liked. It cleaned the inside but not every spot. I used the Alclear glove yesterday and was able to clean all parts of the rim and didn't get one cut. I was so happy with the product I even put it in my cars Instagram.

Suspect your Subaru's head gasket is leaking? Take the guess work out of it. I have a 2002 Forester that started smelling like coolant when I'd turn it off but could never find the source of the leak. I wasn't losing a lot of coolant, maybe about 8 ounces of coolant a week. I checked everything, even the bottom of the engine where you'd normally expect the head gasket to leak. After a week, I ordered this dye kit, added about 3/4 bottle to the radiator and 1/4 to the overflow and took it for a drive. I found my leak within seconds. The driver's side head gasket is leaking on the back of the block, in a place not as common for it to leak. I will definitely be using this on all my vehicles going forward. Make sure you pick up a UV black light from Amazon. I recommend this one: https://amzn.to/2pVGKGX

Did not test on ac voltage. Using this sensor to control an outside LED light on an RV. Low price, but works just as it should! This unit could be used to 'slave' a much larger 12v relay for switching high current draw devices. There is no weather seal around the screw for the mounting bracket. Doesn't appear to be a big deal, but if the sensor will be used in a very wet area, maybe a little sealer would be a benefit.I added a 'customer image' to illustrate the correct wiring for DC operation.EDIT: I now have three of these senors in operation. Noticed that the sensors seem to be extremely sensitive to the light or maybe UV. I had a heck of a time trying to test these once installed outdoors. They will turn on indoors when the sensor is covered. But they don't like to turn on when covered in bright sunlight. Tried covering with my hand and also by putting a leather work glove over the unit. They would not turn on (covered) in sunlight! Maybe aluminum foil would work. So, if you install one of these and it doesn't work when you try to test it during the day, wait 'till dark before concluding it's bad. The relay will probably energize just like it is supposed to once the sun goes down.

So when I bought these it said no turn signals, they came with turn signals and I rechecked the order, and it showed they did in fact have turn signals, not sure if I missed that or it was changed. But needless to say, my truck did not come equipped with turn signal mirrors, I was not expecting them to work. They did! Power top mirror and turn signals work, and for $98 they are awesome compared to super expensive OEM tow mirrors from the dealer. Nice a clear mirrors work great and were a great buy for me. Put these on my 2004 Silverado Z71

The cargo basket fits nicely on my Honda Element. I installed it on my existing OEM roof rack. It took about 20 minutes to assemble and another 10 minutes to install. It looks great and feels like it's of good quality. I drove down the freeway at 90 mph with it unloaded, to test it out and had no issues with the mounts or the basket. I am definitely buying the extension piece for more capacity. It's a fraction of the price of a Thule or Yakima basket making Curt the better buy. The universal crossbar mounts make it a breeze to install. I'd recommend this cargo basket to others.

Just received the bags and doing a fit check on a 2007 KLR650.  Attached image is without the side rails which will keep the right bag off the muffler,  and the bags are not attached.  Bag is filled with rags to show the general volume and appearance.  I rather like the idea of the brighter colour for greater conspicuity (dealing with large population of incompetent Lexus cage operators with limited vision and woefully diminished capacity).

This is a great alternative to the more expensive grills and looks as good if not better.  Yes, you can build it for cheaper but this company took the initiative to do it for us and it isn't that much cheaper.  THE MOST IMPORTANT things is that you MUST USE A SECONDARY ADHESIVE!  I recommend JB Weld for Plastics.  I installed it without the glue and just use the sticky pads and the grill started coming off in a few weeks.  I followed everything else perfectly.  He recommends using glue and I recommend that you better do it.  Otherwise you will not be happy.

I really like this light! Made my trunk super bright very simple to install!.....I do have 2 problems with it is say 1 minor 1 major hence 4 stars.....first the minor problem....the T10 adapter is a tad cheap and touchy the wires that are in the socket needed a little bit of bending and adjusting to make a solid connection not a big deal probably took 2 minutes of adjusting to get it to work flawlessly....the biggest major flaw I seen was the length of the wire, with the adapter connected its maybe 4-5 inches long total a foot or so of wire would have made this a perfect product.  If you're comfortable cutting and splicing wires this won't be an issue for you but it's definitely worth mentioning.Conclusion: a few flaws but worth the money I'd buy it again and everyone I show it to wants their trunk the same way

Installed this hub on my 2004 Silverado 1500 4x4.  Perfect fit, is identical to the original that had gone bad.I was having problems with my ABS coming on at low speeds, and was going to just replace the sensor (the wire that's attached to the hub).  When I jacked the truck up and checked my bearing/hub, I realized it needed to be replaced as well.  I'm hoping this will fix a small shimmy I was having at random times too.  To check if your bearing/hub needs replacing, jack the vehicle up, and then grab the tire at 9 and 3 oclock and try to wiggle it back and forth.  If it's tight as a drum, then no problems.  If you can feel and hear it clunking around, then you probably need a new hub. It'll feel like your lug nuts are loose, but they aren't.

Great product. I did shot it with a coat of clear coat not because the paint was bad just want some added protection. The mounted right up the rubber under mold for perfectly. The bolt for mine did thread in and the bar bolted right in. Just remember is 13 dollars. If the paint is chilling get a can of paint and paint it. It will still be under 20 bucks for the bracket.

literally the best mod i've put on my truck is this muffler. my truck has slight mods like airiad modular intake and hypertech programmer but this muffler is deep and not to loud. it just sounds freaking awesome. stock pipes. left everything the same. just had the stock one cut out and this welded on. couldn't have a bigger smile when it was first started up on the lift.  :DUPDATE: once everything is good and hot the idle rumble is unworldy deep and smooth. it just sounds so good i'll start the truck when i'm outside just to hear it. cold starts are the best i've heard on any vehicle. can't get over how good my truck sounds now!

Received promptly.  Unbox all parts there. Installed and in use and works fine.  Ordered because of height/size improvement over what I have now. One point, it is taller and narrower at the base than most units and as such is a little "tippy" side to side.  Installed in a Class B van and held in place so no problem, just noticed when the top section is filled and the lower section is empty it is definitely top heavy and "tippy'.  Also in response to folks that have expressed problem with electric flush pump failure, I also ordered the manual flush pump (from England, not available in US), have not installed it yet, but will since the electric pump just seems to be  overkill "tech for the sake of tech" and thus just something else to go wrong. Part number is Thetford 92401111 Piston Pump 111, photos attached

I wish I could give 5 stars.  This light is exactly what I wanted for a custom offroad trailer I'm building. I purchased these some time back and have just got around to installing them on the trailer. The lights work as they should, look good, and are bright.  The problem is they are very poorly sealed. The first rain led to water intrusion in both lights. If not for that, they'd be 5 star. Now I'll have to vent, dry and seal these instead.

I really like this sun shade. It folds away and pops up in an instant. I store it between my seat and the center console and it prevents my phone from falling in the crack. (Sunshade is tucked in under hand brake in the photo attached.) Works nicely to keep temperature down in the car. Much nicer to use than my old folding accordion style sun shade.

I got a pair of these from a buddy of mine as a gift.  He told me "figure out where to mount them on your FJ" and that was it.  So a challenge.What I ultimately did with them is mount them to the back swing door on my FJ Cruiser and spliced them into the courtesy lights.  So when I open that back door to unload camping equipment or my 30.06 or my expedition equipment (or, yes, my groceries), I've got plenty of light to see.  And these things light up the place!  Exceptionally bright.  Very crisp and clean light as well.  I can open that door when it's pitch black out and very clearly work on something 10 feet away let alone right there by the back of the vehicle.The center hole makes them very adaptable to a great many mounting and location options.  And the build quality is exceptionally good.  I don't think I'd trust them in a wheel well in a spot where they'd likely get hit with rocks during driving unless you put covers on them until you hit the trail.  But they appear to be very weatherproof and could be used in any number of locations.

I strongly suggest not buying these particular led bulbs, please read my review I have included here:I have just finished changing out all of the incandescent bulbs in our fifth wheel trailer, about 35 bulbs in all. I have purchased several different kinds and and have discovered that you need to have variable voltage 12v-30v volt so as not to overheat. These particular bulbs I purchased and returned because they actually got hot  after a few minutes when turned on. They say 12 volt only and the voltage in most RV varies and any voltage above 12 volts can cause heat , which in my case I was trying to avoid because we have full body paint and in the hot months of the year it ihas a tendency to get very warm in our fifth wheel anyway taxing our A/C. I did purchase some flat pancake , 12v 5mm leds from Amazon and also from eBay for less than half the price for the identical bulbs for the main overhead lighting. I also replaced some of the bayonet barrel types in varying LED sizes in the 921 and 1140 sconces and over the table fixtures. We have found that the super bright ones in the warm white are fantastic and there is practically no heat at all when all of the lights were turned on in our camper. The temperature never rose at all in an hour's time, with the old incandescent bulbs it would literally warm the camper several degrees in an hour. We do not do any dry camping but if you do these might work for you if you don't mind the Heat because I know the amperage usage is tremendously lower with any LED lights.  The lighting is a nice warm light that my wife and I truly like much better than the older, hotter incandescents.

Awesome look and sound. I'd say this is the loudest horn you can get without installing a full blow compressor and air tank. Horn is very loud. Definitely will get the attention of other drivers. I've owned several different air horns of this style and this is the best.

Perfect fit for 2005 Nissan Frontier Nismo. These are valved for a better, firmer ride for lifted vehicles. I replaced my Bilstein 4600 series struts with these Bilstein 5100 series struts. They made a huge difference in ride quality and they allow you to either stay at the stock height, or you can adjust them (through the external snap ring) up to 2" of total lift. These struts are designed for use of factory coil springs or light duty aftermarket springs. They DO NOT come with coil springs, upper strut rod bushings, upper strut mount plates, or upper coil spring isolators. The contents of the box include:-Bilstein 5100 strut (qty 1)-upper strut rod nut (qty 1)-upper strut rod washer (qty 1)-black strut rod boot cover (qty 1)-black zip tie (qty 1)-Bilstein stickerI recommend any product by Bilstein,CPS

These things are pretty darn bright which is nice. I am in the process of mounting these on said motorcycle and am testing out placement and signal pattern. The initial problem that I ran into was that the screws will pop right through the 'weatherproof' rubber grommet due to the holes or cutouts being the same size as the head of the screw and the nut. I solved this by adding some washers that I had laying around. The wires leading from each flashing unit are right about 29" in length. The 1 sheet of basic instructions can feel overwhelming at first if you've never played with electrical bits before, but fret not, just play around with it and you'll get it right. Black is to Negative, Red is to Positive and both Yellows get wired together.Pro Tip! Make sure that you set BOTH flashers to the SAME pattern before hooking everything up to its final destination/layout. You do this by hooking up the red and black wire and leaving the red partially exposed. You then tap the Yellow wire onto the red wire for a mere split second and it will go to the next flashing pattern. Select your favorite pattern and do the same thing to the other side with its Yellow wire. Once they are both on the same pattern you can hook up both Yellows together and leave them that way.Confused? Don't be, it is pretty much simple trial and error.Final note, I do really like these and how bright they are. How they will hold up over the long run we shall see. First I will need to find a way to mount them permanently.PS: I couldn't flip the pictures/video, I'm sorry, I know it's annoying.

Nice kit. I like the switch but the sticky tape on the back is a joke. Also the leads for the fog lights could be about a foot longer. There is a positive and negative that comes off the relay so you can ground right to the battery terminal.

I will agree with most reviews, I got what I paid for.  This is junk. I am on my third one.  The first one arrived with already broken clips, the second one a clip broke during installation and the third one went in ok, although it is not a snug as the OEM part was.  Third one was installed in January 2017, the picture below is what you can expect at 6 months.  They are saying they will not replace it even though this one has not been installed for even a year.  If you choose to buy at least you ere warned.

I mounted on my 2015 Kawasaki Versys. I used some 1/2" U bolts or something to secure it upside-down to the front bar under the headlights. I had to open the unit up to bolt it down from the inside so it would be flush. There are nice channels to feed in a nut to secure an external bolt. I've opened several of these types of LED lights, they seal fine and have decent internals with a good build feel.This light is the exact same thing as the 18w single panel lights, just wider, same as the 54" bars, too.Light output is great, it could replace your headlights if they are bad, but it doesn't project as far as I would like, needs a sense for that.UPDATE:It's been five months and the light works perfectly and hasn't moved a bit. I have a smoked windshield so it may be a bit bright on the immediate ground, shield with tape if needed. I decided to invest in LED headlights and such before attaching any more lights to my bike.These past 5 months have seen 10,000 miles and a lot of usage of this light with no issues. I currently have it wired into my high beam so it'll work with my trigger switch. No electrical issues for this type of load, works great.

Ok jeepers detailed review alert! I have a 2014 jku. The product fit on my jeep great! It had a warped look to it out of the box but as long as you pull tight and drill a hole as far from the last home it flattens out and looks good. I started my screw where the tailgate hinge is and went from there. I am putting my recovery gear in the bags. My tree saver strap fit in the larger bag along with a couple extra d rings , winch controller glove and winch controller and gloves in smaller bag. For the money it seems like good quality bags and backing. The molle straps on bag were a snug fit like they should be. I wouldnt plan on putting a lot of heavy items in the included bags or attached to the molle backing. THE BIGGEST THING TO CONSIDER- if you have a factory subwoofer in the back of you jeep like I do, this will interfere with some of your molle storage space. You can see what I mean in my picture, I mounted the larger bag as close to the sub as I could, only lost a couple of inches. But I would still buy it again. I made the mistake once of putting all my recovery gear in the hidden floor compartment in the back of the Jeep. When I needed it once I had to move a very large very heavy cooler and a lot of camping gear and food just to get to everything, so these bags will keep that from happening to me ever again I hope. DO NOT STORE YOUR RECOVERY GEAR UNDER TRUCK HIDDEN COMPARTMENT UNDER THE FLOOR MAT.

STOP AND READ THIS BEFORE YOU PURCHASE!!!Dorman makes a good product. They are the top of the line aftermarket supplier. I ordered what I thought was a Dorman part, but received a absolute junk copy. If you receive one of these in a plastic bag instead of a box, more then likely you've been ripped off. I purchased mine "Prime" but it turns out it wasn't directly from Amazon. Mine came from "FENDON", and is a copy. Dorman has been contacted, and Amazon will be contacted as well. They are basically stealing from people right out in the open. Some people suck!! Ordered again, and made sure it came directly from Amazon. I took some pictures of the difference. If it doesn't have a gasket included or casting marks on the back, its a copy. If it doesn't have a gasket installed on it, Its a copy. If the edges are not smooth and even, its a copy.Installed the Dorman handle and it worked fine. It is not a factory handle, but for 1/3 the price, it works fine.

I purchased these to give more stability to a bumper splitter installed on my 2014 Fiesta ST. Installation was simple and the struts seem to be well constructed. I removed the large tubes though as they are not held solidly in place if you have to extend the struts at all. I didn't want them rattling around... plus it just looks odd having the ends stick out past the larger tube.

Really nice, heavy duty D-rings.  I purchased the 4 pack and later ordered a 2 pack.  Installation is much easier with two people, where one can work above the floor and the other below.  With my son and I working as a team, it took less than 15 minutes to install each one.  We used a different method to install them, rather than the instructions.  You will definitely appreciate the backing plates, as there is minimal material between where the large hole is cut (you will need a large hole saw and good size 1/2 drill) and the mounting bolt holes are drilled.  I used 3/8" carriage bolts, 1 3/4" long to attach to the 3/4" plywood floor of my utility trailer.

Good value for the price but obviously much cheaper quality than the originals.The color was way off. Instead of being dark grey, it was closer to silver. Also, the illumination was blindingly bright with no way of adjusting or turning off. I actually had to disassemble it and remove the LEDs. I also noticed that these units are not replicated and parts do not appear to be interchangeable with the originals.

So got this light and was pretty excited! It looks very well constructed! I was mounting this on a Ford F-350 with a road armor pre runner bumper. I spent about 40 bucks to mount it as I wanted it. I mounted it and and wired it! It worked great! Super bright and good true white light! It had been on there about a week and sure as hell it has a ton of condensation! It sucks, love the light, works great but just a matter of time till it starts getting that yellowish tinge to the glass with all that moisture in it. This light bar had amazing reviews, how have more people not had moisture issues also. Guess I will just spend the extra money to buy the RIGID light bar.......

These are soooooooo bright. I LOVE them!!!I have had issues in the past with replacing the dome lights in cars with LEDS and they just weren't bright or just weren't nearly as omnidirectional as a standard halogen bulb would be.Not these guys!! They might be a little on the pricey side compared to other LED bulbs, but they are worth it.Let the pictures speak for themselves. Both pictures were taken at night, one with the rear glass open, and the other with the glass (tinted btw) closed.If you turn these on at night it will feel like daytime on the inside

These are great. Nice and clear and a great upgrade to bring a little more modern design to my aging Yukon XL. Install was a breeze and was done in less than 20min for both. The only reason I didn't give 5 starts is their included hardware did not suffice and I had to reuse the bolt/clips from the old lights to complete install. Overall still very happy though. It's been quite a rainy season here and they're still water tight and working perfect. Definitely recommended though they should get better hardware and include some screws.

I travel rural areas without cell service and few motorists for a cable jump. This jump starter has given me peace of mind when in the middle of nowhere. It comes with an 18 month hassle-free warranty. If you register it you get an additional 12 months extended warranty. That's a thirty month warranty. RAVPower stands behind the quality of their products. The jumper has protections for short circuit, low voltage, reverse charging, reverse polarity and high temperature. The instructions are straight forward and easy to follow. All the parts are in an easy to carry case. The LED flashlight is very bright and ideal for camping, vehicle repair or locating items in the dark. I have charged my MP3 player without problem. I am pleased with my purchase.Product update: dead battery this morning. Hooked up the Jump Starter per instructions and my van came to life instantly. Saved an expensive jump or a one mile walk for a new battery. I am very, very pleased.

Optimum Instant Detailer & Gloss Enhancer (OID) is a fantastic product and I'd highly recommend it! I use it primarily after washing and drying my car, to get any remaining water marks out and give it a quick shine. I start by using a large waffle weave microfiber towel to get off the majority of the remaining water, after using the sheeting method to get the initial bulk of it off. No swirling at all with the towel, just lay it over the portion of the car I'm drying and pull it off. There may be some remaining water streaks, but they'll come off with the OID. Now that the car is almost entirely dry, I go back with a thick weave microfiber polishing cloth and the OID. Just spray a little onto the car, wipe it in with the low nap side of the polishing cloth, and then go back over it one more time with the larger nap side. Only takes a couple minutes to do the whole car and the results are definitely worth the effort! The product is very easy to remove...nothing like a wax.My car is only a couple months old, so I've never had it detailed or put on any wax other than what the factory shipped it with (I'll be doing that shortly). However, the OID adds an incredible glass-like shine to the car and I honestly think it looks better than when I picked the car up from the showroom! Wax would obviously provide better protection, but this looks at least as good and takes only minutes. Note that while it's nice to keep in the car for quick touch ups, this is not a waterless wash product and shouldn't in place of washing your car.This is my first bottle and I purchased the 17oz version to see how I liked it. However, I'll definitely be purchasing the 32oz concentrate when this runs out, which is a significantly better deal!

This was my first adventure into the world of generic / universal no-name, no-brand Chinese ATVs.  I like that the parts are super super cheap and mostly available but I don't like not having a complete service manual and having to assemble bits and pieces of information on the internet, forums, etc.Here's my machine's info:2007 ATV Mfg by Zhejiang Fuxin 107cc (aka 110cc), Imported by Fushin USA, LLC.Brand: FuxinModel: ATV110Mfg: 11/2007Same as "Brand": Kazuma USAThe key can be removed and put back in the rubber cap.  The rubber is nice because it hides the key and looks like a knob or switch.  Key can't be pulled out when the key is in the ON position.  Plugged right into my wire harness with no modification needed.  I recommend putting some electrical contact dielectric grease (available at any auto store comes in a small tube ~$3) on each of the 4 pins to keep moisture out.Why 'hot-wire' it when you can do it right.  Nothing like having a 'real' key.

Installed on my 2014 Challenger R/T.  The swap took approximately 5 minutes. great quality and finish but use care or fineness when tightening the tiny hex screw.....seems like it could be easily stripped. Defiantly worth 30 bucks.

I got this battery based on the listed dimensions even though it wasn't specced for my 1982 CB450SC Nighthawk. The battery fit exactly into my battery holder (not a mm to spare) and the bike started faster than it ever has while I've had it. The battery also arrived fully charged, which was a plus.I was originally going to get the Yuasa version of this battery, but I decided I would give this one a shot at half the price. I'm glad I did, the CCA capacity seems to be great and plenty for my bike.

I love this thing. Really gave the rear that little touch I was looking for. My 4 plug was really corroded from previous owner, so I just spliced into the wiring (I added an inline 7 plug for towing). The only two gripes I have with it are the red LEDs light up with the tailights when the headlights are on. I know I can cut the wire and change this, and I just may, that's not a fault of the product, just how the plug works. And my other gripe was the 3M tape was not sticky at all. I ended up using super glue, works fine!! All in all a great product! Bright red and white, turn signals work, plenty of wire, orange is long enough to tap into the reverse lights. Fits a 2002 F150 with the normal bed (not sure about step side fit)Update!! I have grown to like the look with it on with the tailights, and it is still working great, no lights out!  2/2017

I purchased these to attach to my Roadmaster adjustable tow bar. It came with lesser grade bolts, so I went to Lowes and got grade 8 bolts and some washers to take up the extra space. No problem; an extra $8. The large 7/8" pin through the d-ring recovery points also needed a few washers. That's fine. HOWEVER, the safety ring pin in the 7/8" pin is too small and too close to the end. While towing that ring pin wiggled loose. The large pin dropped out and my Jeep hit the back of my RV. Pretty lame. I KNEW that ring pin was too small and I trusted it anyway. Live and learn.

Very solid portable organizer. The&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Aomaso-Auto-Trunk-Organizer/dp/B01F3BXW6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Aomaso Auto Trunk Organizer</a>&nbsp;is easily great for the car, but the house, work, this organizer is great for keeping things where they need to be. This guy has durable handles meaning it can carry my cargo where ever I need it to go; solid metal, not plastic or fabric.Groceries can be a pain to get into the house, the Aomaso Auto Trunk Organizer means items I bagged stay in the bag and can be easily carried in side, depending on weight and my personal ability to carry, all at one time. Warehouse club visit? Easy to store boxed items and even those fruits and veggies.This is also great if you drive a clunker, that is always going through fluids. Easy to organize the antifreeze, oil, windshield fluid and more all in the unit, and likely have the other side free for storing other stuff. The mesh side pockets makes a great place for storing smaller items that are great to have (microfiber towel, tools, and so on).Assembly is a snap, just pop it open and slide in the combined bottom to give it rigidly. Need the extra space for something else? The unit folds flat instantly, great space saving design. I can even use just half the unit by folding the bottom and buckle the sides. This system has made keeping my car organized so much easier. Im very happy with the quality (made for rugged use in a car), and the nice color scheme.  Excellent storage pockets, and easy to adjust the organizer based on space available and need.  The bottom has Velcro that can be used to secure the unit to the floor to keep it from moving around in sport utility cars and vans.[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]

I used 60 sq ft of this car insulation to go into my Nova drag car and am not impressed on the value.  Here's my take on it.  This product is a thinner version of what the big box store's sell for half the price.Here's a brief comparison:Car insulation:-1/4" thick-R-value of 1-expensiveBig box store insulation:-R-value of 3-1/3" thick-affordableDo your research before buying to make sure this is what you need.  You will want to put down a Butyl rubber layer beneath this for maximum sound proofing.

Absolute garbage product. Brass snapped at the joint leading from the bottle threads to the body. Do not waste your money. This product may work a couple times, but there is no way it's durable enough to be considered a worthwhile purchase. I'll be looking at the more expensive "brand name" options.

Great quality and boxed well for shipping. My only complaint is the silver mounting bolts and stainless allen head step screws. I actually sanded and primed all of them black before mounting. Looks fantastic now, but if that doesn't matter then just install it and move on. The directions are straight forward but it is mandatory to leave all bolts loose before tightening or they won't go on.

Tried JB Weld on my cracked radiator tank and it failed immediately under pressure.  Tried this and it's held up for 4 days so far.  I'll update this if it fails in an unreasonable time.It says to push it into the crack, but when I tried, it just pulled right back out, because it was sticking to my fingers more than to the plastic. I had to push into the crack and then smear my fingers sideways so it would stay where I put it.  I applied it once, let it cure, sanded it, and applied more on top, and it seems to have worked.  Has the consistency of playdoh, and looks like it when cured.  I hope it flexes well with thermal expansion and contraction.

The red is just beautiful.  It's pure and not slightly pink like the white bulb shinning through the colored lens.  These are also super bright for LED bulbs.  They fit the brake light module for a Mitsubishi lancer de 2009.  Unfortunately, the difference between the high and low setting is horrible.  It's almost the same brightness.  For a show car if you are planning to just have it sit in the lot, then these bulbs are for you.  If you don't want to get rear ended, because the person couldn't tell your brake lights increased in brightness, these bulbs are not for you.  Sad that my 194 putco's were working so well and these were a disappointment.Putco if you are reading this, take out 50% more led's out of the low cycle and I'll try these again!

Disappointed. I own a 2015 JK Sahara Unlimited. I really wanted this to work, so did my 7 year old son. Tape doesn't line up very well, or at all ( area was cleaned before I applied them). Flipped them up side down, moved them around to other positions, removed front grille panel & applied pressure from both sides to attempt to get them to stick. 5 of 7 didn't stay put whatsoever. The ones that managed to stick were barely hanging on. The bezels are another thing. Out of the box one was already scratched up ( looked used??) I removed the front panel so I could ensure the clips connected on the light housing correctly. The first one clipped in with no problems, the 2nd one, only 2 of the clips would connect. tried as I might, it wasn't going on. I spent a little more than 2 hours attempting to make this, what should have been a 10-15 minute process, work as I really didn't want to send it back.  Installation is pretty self explanatory, so don't expect instructions. Not worth the headache. Only good here was that with Prime I received it in 2 days.

Easy install. Installed after putting bumper on. Followed some videos on YouTube and used their recommendations for routing the wires to the battery. Took me longer than it should have because I was doing in at night and in the rain, but when it came I couldn't wait any longer. Followed instructions on first use and had no issues. My jeep (and a few others I have read) was missing a second bolt for the battery terming, so Iconnected to the main post. It kept loosening and killing the jeep so I found a bolt to connect to the extra terminal.

I didn't use all that big rubber weather stripping because it didn't want to fit right, but with the thin weather stripping it works fine.

I have been RV'ing for almost 30 years myself and 50 years if you consider it all started with my parents before me taking the family RV'ing.  The 4" stinky slinky has been in use for that entire time and it is about time someone came up with something as easy and wonderful as this.  Wish I thought of it.  It has made the absolute worst part of RV'ing a non issue, particularly if you put just a bit of effort into the installation if you have a coach with a utility area like I have (any class "A" coach).  Check the photo I have included.  I made a simple and easily removable manifold out of pex so that all of my connections are at a single point.  The manifold stays put all the time.  I just swing ball valves to direct water where I need it and never have to connect/disconnect once we are parked.  The Sewer Solutions is even better than the only other option to the stinky slinky which would be a $400 macerater pump which is still messy and stinky.The best thing about this product are:1) No more mess and no more smell2) I used to always leave the grey tank shut so I could use it to flush down a bit after dumping black.  No need any more2a) Leave grey valve open all the time when at the park.3) Pull the black valve, turn on the flush, walk away for a few minutes or wait for brown to turn clear, shut the valve - done4) I bring a 1" x 10ft length of PVC pipe with a 90 and copper adaptor on it just in case I need more reach at the park.  No concerns with uphill/downhill5) I can now go straight home after a trip - no need to find a dump station because I have a 30ft x 1" PVC line with unions that I can quickly connect to my clean-out at home, so that is 40ft + away and slightly uphill and it works flawlessly.Summary: I can't rave about this product enough.  Made the absolute worst part of RV'ing a complete non issue.

Second set Kensun lights that have caused issues. The first set I figured was a bad batch, and they lasted about 3 months, but. I literally installed these about a month ago and I've already got one not firing. Pretty pissed because I have to take apart my entire front end and remove the headlight assembly to replace bulbs in this truck. I opted to go with Kensun over the cheaper set I have in my fog lights because of the difficulty in replacing, but the cheap set works and the more expensive set has already taken half a dump..... Explain that.I'm going to request a refund or a replacement... Or both. I just really don't feel like tearing everything back out... Again.

==Review Update==Unfortunately,my joy was short lived! In less that three months,the seat cover is torn apart in several places. Therefore,and out of obligation to my fellow Amazon shoppers,I have to report this negative change,while lowering my star rating! In other words,it is okay for few a couple of months only!!The biggest mistake I did when I bought my car,is not getting covers for the leather seats! Now,instead of using the covers to protect the seats,I am using them to cover the rips and discoloration of the leather!!Quality/Material:------------------------The covers are mainly made out of semi stretch material,something like Rayon or some other blend of material. Middle portion of covers,the part you lean your back on and the sitting on area,are reinforced with beehive style mesh material (see my pictures bellow) that gives it enough breathing or aerating room! Lower ends of covers comes with an elastic attachments and back to front straps,to secure the seat cover in place.Installation/Use:------------------------As I mentioned in my title,it was a nice surprise that they did fit perfectly in my Nissan/Murano with detachable headrest,despite the clear message in the Product Description "The Seat covers are for seats with NONE detachable headrest" I just covered all including the headrests,and it looks and works rather fine!! Just make sure you take your time and have patience when installing,so you get the ultimate fitting look of the covers! The back to front straps are designed to keep the seats in place while in use! Elastic side attachments can hook up anywhere to the side of the seats. Also included a bag of small metal hooks for additional securing points,although I didn't need to use them in my car! Installation obviously will vary from one car model to another! In my case installation on the Nissan/Murano took about ten minutes for every seat.Final Thoughts:----------------------Although the material is not the thickest out there,yet the covers are made to look good and serve the purpose of protecting your car seats and keep them in decent shape,which will make a big difference when it comes to resale value of your vehicle. Having said that,I do recommend these car seat covers and attest to their decent quality! As far as durability and long lasting,it all remains to be seen with use and time,and I will make sure to come back and report on that in the future. I hope you'll find my humble opinion helpful in making or breaking your buying decision, if so please return the favor by hitting the YES button bellow while you're at it :)*sample was provided at no cost,through a test/tell program,with no obligation to providing party!!

These look really nice, but the end of the bulb is round. If you have a traditional H1 reflector you probably have rectangular hole for the bulb.  These will not insert. It's unfortunate as the round  end doesn't seem to required and could have been manufactured to be compatible.

The rubber is very grippy so lint and dust does stick to it. Some other reviewer mentioned that you can wash it off once in a while. Thats not really necessary. You can just easily clean it by lifting up all the lint with a piece of tape.The cutouts are perfect (2015 CR-V). Even allows access to the switch on the rear for detaching the fob from the key.If you often drop your keys or throw your keys onto your desk, then this will serve to protect your fob. Also, if you get any of the colored ones, itll help your keys stand out more (making them easier to find!).

Great idea but may not fit on your mount.  With my Curt receiver and current mount there was not enough space for this tightener.  I am going to use it on the Pro series cargo rack which seems to fit with some pounding.  Honestly, I will never buy a tightener that needs to be removed with a wrench so this is a good idea if you have a longer mount than mine.Update:  I bought a straight ball mount (welded) and this slides on perfectly.  Takes 100% of the slop out of the mount and most importantly comes off / on without a wrench unlike other hitch tighteners.

It's not Hi Viz yellow. It's a darker yellow but still looks good. It's not as reflective as other brands triple the price, but it does reflect light. I didn't buy it for its reflectiveness. I bought it to make my bike stand out from other Yamaha R3's. It IS reflective and it IS yellow.

I bought these to try on my 2001 Kawasaki Ninja 250.  They are awesome.  Rode the motorcycle to work yesterday morning.  It was 32 degrees out, I had a 33 mile ride at speeds of about 75 MPH.  I just wore my vented mesh summer gloves inside of these, which do nothing to keep you warm, and my hands were toasty warm for the whole ride.These will not fit without some modification if you have mirrors mounted to your handlebars.Easy to install, just slip them over the handlebar and pull the strap tight.

I needed a puller/installer NOW to replace the vacuum pump on my 1987 Ford F250 6.9, with the V-belt pulley. Cheap pullers would not fit it. I went to Napa and found this exact kit, but for about $25 more than on Amazon. I'm traveling and couldn't be bothered trying to buy online. This tool fit and worked perfectly. I got the pulley pulled and installed right on store counter after I bought the tool, with a little help from the clerk. You'll need a vise or someone to hold the pump still is the only thing, but that's typical. Cheaper than paying a mechanic and better than buying another pulley, which would have only been $20 less than I paid for this tool set.

I tried pulling a wiper off. It keeps slipping off. There should be some kind of a lock that ensures that the arms don't open up once engaged. Won't work as is for wipers, don't know about battery.If you need to get your wipers off right away, attached are two pictures showing how you can make this tool work. Not ideal but at least you get the job done before sending them back.

Glad I spend the exta $10 on this one. Live in northshore of boston and we just had some downpours.. real heavy stuff.. anyways decided to test it out then. I still had a little puddle gather on seat as well as some spatter on the pipes (may have come when o took soaked cover off) id say it does its job well. If you leave your bike out all year look for another cover. I have the option to garage when I need to. I just don't like playing tetris with all the crap (I rent roon in 4bdr) also.. I bought the large and have a honda rebel... amd its a tight fit.. if I end up puttin on ammo cans this cover may not fit.  I wish I got an XL for that reason and the fact a looser fit would be easier on/off. Material is good. Gunna take a while for it to tear (unlike the econo ones) bit anything will tear of you snag and pull hard enough.

I am very pleased with this product. This was very easy to apply and I had perfect results. I followed the directions except for removing the tailgate because I had to apply it to the tailgate as well. I used the recommended yellow tape and I experienced no seepage under the tape. The only extra piece of equipment I used was a fine grained sanding block whereas the green scrub pad they provided was not very effective. It was similar to one of those green pads you'd use on pans. I applied two coats as suggested and you should plan your schedule accordingly because you will likely need the full four hours between the first and second coat. I waited overnight before removing the tape after the second coat. Also be sure to dispose of the used roller cover outside because it has a strong smell. Definitely wear gloves and long pants and sleeves. I certainly could have used a smaller quart instead of a gallon for my 6 foot truck bed.

This is the only product I need to keep my bike looking like the show room look. It works on painted surface, chrome, chrome wheels & accessories. Just clean out the bike first to get rid of all the mud and dirt then finish off with this and you would have a brand new looking bike

Bright and good quality. Still just 20w but good as support leds. I have 2 on the sides of my jeep Wrangler and ao far, they are working perfectly.Well, Im correcting my previous review.Ive bought the Auxbeam just to see if its really worth it vs the chinese Led's. And I can say I will never buy Auxbeam again!!I installed the Auxbeam just 1 month ago and there is already humidity inside!!I have the chinese leds for the last 2 years and they are working awesome!, no humidity, great output and really bright! And the most important: quarter part of the price of the Auxbeam!!Never again Auxbeam!!

This is a sweet addition to your helmet makes you stand out and be seen out in the streets. The rubber it's made from seems high quality. My helmet has edges so I wasn't sure it would work but the part that's making contacting holds it in place so well it does not wiggle or fly off. I live in Oregon so I tested through rain and so far so good it has held on. I say it is a good investment.

96 Dakota Extended Cab.The rear two bolt holes lined up just fine, and the upper two were close enough (still had to bore the frame holes out a bit) but, the front two were off by almost 1/2 the diameter of the hole in the hitch. Anyone who's used a drill before knows how much of a PITA it is to drill a hole 1/2 way over another hole. The frame rails in the truck were not bent at all. I checked the measurement between each diagonally after my first attempt to install. I removed another bolt-on hitch from the vehicle to install this one. The other hitch lined up perfectly.

Fit well and seems to be well made. My only critique would be that the bolt hole for the light is too big for LED lights like the one pictured. They seem to me more appropriate for KC type round lights that have a larger mounting bolt.

Cheap fast reliable fit my 2016 pw50 gap at .025-.030 and you should be good to go anything between this number will work. This is what manual call for NGK BP4HS. My plug was all gummed up and and bike was running crappy and this with a new filter helped it smooth out remember to take off the end cap so you plug wire will fit

So I'll keep this brief and to the point (sort of)...I purchased the 50 inch 5D series curved light bar for $129. Just like you see in all videos regarding Auxbeam bars, the box had been through hell but the bar itself was somehow unscathed. At first glance the bar looks great (for a $129 light bar).Some things that irked me right off the bat is the lack of connectors on the light side of the wiring. The harness came with protected female spades but the light itself only had stripped and tinned wires. No biggie. A couple of male spades and everything fit together. If you look real close at one of the pictures they have a couple lose connectors laying there. Those were not in the package. The reason it bothers me is because it's sort of implied in the listing that it's plug and play.Before I even turned it on I noticed that the alignment of the reflectors in relation to one another is a little off. The lenses themselves are also not crystal clear. The beam pattern is kinda wonky. The included picture is from 10ft away with the bar perfectly level.The thing is bright but not what I would have expected from a 50" 288w 28880lm light bar. (I know the numbers are BS but I really was expecting more).After only having it on for a minute or two I noticed the wiring from the relay to the light was very warm to the touch. When turned on from room temp within a minute you can feel it warming up. For a 288w light at 12v pulling 24amps you would need atleast 12ga (.081) wire. I was surprised (kinda) to find 14ga (.064).All the other stuff I could have put up with for as little as I spent, but the wiring really has me worried. Gave it 3 stars because I went bought it hoping for the best, expecting the worst.I will be updating this review with night time photos and infrared photos of the wiring at time intervals.

I installed this on my Ford Fusion and it worked perfectly.  But you will need additional tools to make it happen. One is the OTC 7483 and the other is the OTC 7771A installer. You actually need to use the nut from the 7771A with the 7483 to reinstall the water pump pulley.  I also had to use some anti seize on the tool threads where the screw into the cam so that it doesn't cause any damage and made everything go on smoothly.  I hope this review helps!

I was hoping this would help me remove swirl marks from car washes but it did nothing....I take care of my car and thought this product look promising as turtle wax is my go to brand for all my car needs and this specific product was just useless. Just a black colored liquid that didn't really do anything that it said. I had to use the turtle wax black wax spray to help remove this and bring the shine out with the swirl marks still there.

Mine starts at the last setting used, as it's always hooked to the battery.  The only issue I've had is it seems other car door remotes seem to turn it on without warning for some reason.  Was in a parking lot at night and someone came up and asked where I got it, and I didn't even turn it on, but it was on!

This is a fantastic inverter for the price not a pure sign wave but I knew that when purchasing. Unit was purchased for a 700amp hour solar generator equipped with 4 Renogy 100watt solar panels for charging while dry glamping/camping.It's incredibly important that the wife can use her Keurig K10 (draws only 700 watts to brew) coffee maker.  As they say "Happy Wife, Happy Life". This unit runs our laptops, K10 Keurig coffee maker (larger Keurig units draw to much power and will shut off)  even hook up our karaoke machine, small AC unit, small refrigerator Handles everything with no issues. Only improvement that I would like to see would be an amp usage meter and battery voltage meter be built in.  For this I just purchased a Electricity Usage Monitor,Household Appliance Energy Watt Voltage Amps Meter Electricity Usage Monitor with LCD Display Plug Power.  Unit has fans for keeping it cool in the hot outdoor summer weather. During inclement weather we just put it inside the solar generator.  I would definitely buy another if we needed it. Keep in mind it's 2000 total watts total not 2000 watts per plug with a peak of 4600 combined.

Instantly improves your reverse lighting. This is a no-brainer Jeep mod that won't break the budget and is actually useful for everyday driving. Replacing the low light bulbs with this LED unit makes backing up in the dark much easier. I found the difference in illumination very useful in parking in my dark driveway at night. Easy plug in installation.Do yourself a favor and brighten the path behind you!

Wonderful interior lights! I can literally see everything now!!! I had horrible halogen style bulbs before that barely displayed any light inside the car. I will say that the blue color is very bright and can be disorienting if looked at for a period of time but theoretically no one should be staring at them. All in all, it gave my car a very unique look at night compared to everyone else's rides and I can actually see when I need to at night/low light conditions. Easy installment and worth every penny. Great product guys, can't go wrong with it. One picture I uploaded was just to show everyone that these lights are bright!! I have 5% tint on my car all the way around and they're shining through it! I love my blue LED lights!

Thess lights are great. A very nice upgrade, while not having to spend a fortune on the Harley LED upgrade.When I received these lights I pulled the paperwork out of the package and set it aside, not realizing that it was the very good directions for how to install the lights. Since I have replaced lights on my Harley before I really didn't need the directions, but if you need them, they are well written.I did have one hang up on the install. The retaining clip that holds the bulb in place on the headlight was contacting the wires that wrap around the fan motor.. I imagined that with the vibrations inherent in a Harley, combined with a bit of Wyoming gritty dust, that the clip might eventually rub through the insulation and cause a short circuit. All I did to solve this problem was bend the retaining clip so it did not touch the wires.Installation of the passing lamp bulbs was as simple as replacing the bulb. I would however recommend cleaning the inside of all of the lenses while you have the bulbs out. Be careful not to scratch the plastic on the inside, but with care, cleaning them is not that hard.I would recommend these to anyone looking to upgrade to more high visibility lighting.

Just got done installing this on my boat. I really struggled thinking how to install it. I made a template and soon realized it was more trouble than it was worth. I just measured the length of the sheet needed to cover the boat, cut it, and started from there. The lines on the foam made my straight cuts with a razor pretty easy.Hint: I sanded the surface first, sprayed of any grime/oil, warm soapy water with a brush, rinse with hose again. Let it air dry. Install it on a warm day to allow the boat deck to heat up to have the adhesive on the foam stick better.

Fitted to 2014 Ford Fusion.First opening: unzipped bag and came with two ripped threads on front passanger seat cover. See images. No off smells or other issues. I would suggest ironing seat covers before install.Install: No major issues with install. The front seats had a big of resistance when pushing bottom down around buttons for seat positioning. Head rests fit well with the rest. Have only gotten in once since install and seem to fit OK.Back seats install was fairly easy. Took bottom seat out for install. Straps work well and snug. There is an option for seat cover to keep 60/40 seat option if you need to push one down without removing them.  Head rest had plenty of spare room on two outsides. I may add foam later for a cleaner look. But for now I've just rolled and pinched the extra fabric. See images.Use cation when installing, threads are not the best and fabric is thin. All in all, and so far, sears are what you expect for a universal one. I'll update with usage and how well it holds up with use.

Plugged in no problem on my 2003 Tahoe and works just fine.  Had to use gasket sealer to seal it into the hole in the sheet metal. They should have used a thicker diameter hole plug. After only 1 year of use, 3 of the LEDs stopped working. Trash...

Good color.  At least as bright as the stock ones.  The cartridge that the LEDs fit into appears to be built well, but the cam lock portion is clocked a little further than the stock ones, resulting in the contacts landing just outside of the contact area on the circuit board.  I had to leave them a little less than completely locked in place in order to get them to work.  At this point, its a minor annoyance...time will tell if they stay in place not fully locked.  I put these in an 02 GMC 2500HD Duramax.

Was fine while it lasted. I loved the sound from the rear; not too pleasant inside as it would get really annoying in low RPM but was bearable. Super easy to install; but I'm glad I held onto the OEM since I have to put it back on until I purchase a better, longer lasting dual exhaust muffler. I won't buy this one again. Same old adage true once again...you get what you pay for.

This is junk.  This is dangerous.  Was changing the front brake pads on a Hyundai Tucson using two of these to lift the front end.  The 6000lb combined limit should have been more than enough to lift the front end since the whole car weighs less than 4000lbs.  One jack buckled and twisted and the car dropped, and the other jack bent too.  Should have read the other reviews more carefully since other people had similar problems.  After seeing the metal, it looks to me like cheap soft steel.  Lots of pitting under the powder coat.  And the small base didn't help matters.  I spent 15.99 on two jacks that are now scrap metal.  I wish I would have done this job a couple of weeks earlier because now I can't return this garbage.  I want my money back!

Perfect fit for my 2015 Camry, Install was easy, even easier if you have a angle screw driver, you don't need to drill, it comes with all the hardware you need, there are marks on the rear bumper for the 3 screws, no drilling needed , if you have angle driver you don't need to remove the tires, tools needed phillips screw driver and 10mm socket that's it.

I was skeptical about trying these because I didn't see anyone else putting these on a motorcycle but I just ordered the right size and they fit fine.

Great visibility and enhances the look of my bike, definitely recommend!

I have 6 of these lights total.  Four on my zero turn mower and two on the back of my tractor.  In both cases I made custom mounting brackets to mount the lights.The only drawback with these lights is the ability to change the angle of projection.  There is tilt up/down and swing side to side but the tilt is limited.

This helmet is cheap. I'm surprised it's DOT certified. I'm including photos showing the damage from a 2 ft 5 in drop. It cracked in 2 different places and is now unusable. I can't image what would happen to a child's skull in a crash if this amount of damage happened from such a short drop.  Do yourself a favor and buy a helmet that will actually protect your child.

I recently used this for the first time on my brother's SRT Plum Crazy Challenger.  It only has 8,000 miles on it so I figured it would not make that big of a difference.  Boy was I mistaken.  I did 1/2 of the rear quarter panel.  I stepped back and looked at the same focal point in both halves.  The polished was in HD, the unpolished was a blurry SD.  It works great and goes a long way.  Most modern cars cost around 6k to repaint, so spend a few extra bucks to get the good stuff to keep it nice!

Simple wiring and they look really good. However, I needed to fill the hole in my Ninja 250r fairings to install them (or make new holes), and they are NOT very bright. I can't see them at all in the day. They seem sufficient at night. Others tell me they look nice and work just fine, and that they definitely prefer these over my stock lights. Soooo... I'll keep them. I just WISH THEY WERE BRIGHTER! :(

This was my first experience using a 2 part clear coat of this type and first time painting/finishing a motorcycle tank. I am very pleased with the results I got with this product. 5 days after application I have noticed no issues with the finish or the paint beneath it. The tank finish was a combination of bare metal(sanded polished and cleaned with Gumout de-greaser, then cleaned with a strong cleaner to remove any de-greaser residue) a racing stripe and narrow pin stripes. I used flat black primer on the racing stripe and red VHT high temp caliper paint on the pin stripes. I used the entire can of USC Spraymax 2k Glamour High Gloss and managed to get 4-5 coats (including a lighter initial coat). Like others recommended I wore a quality respirator while spraying. I also used a Rust-oleum comfort handle attachment. Would definitely buy again!

not much to say, these things prety much sell themselves.  they are relatively easy to install and wire.  I have zero electrical experience, but consider myself somewhat decent at following directions.  I've had them on for around 3 months, and they really are bright and allow you to see considerably further down a dark road.  I just used one of those generic rocker switches and it works great.

I am very much a DIYer and would much rather make my own sun shade but I opted to go ahead and try this out due to time constraints in my schedule, and turns out... it's great! the construction is very rugged and feels like it'll last a while. The sizing also fits very well when strapped down. My favorite part is that the bungee cords are sewn into the lining so you won't have to worry about losing them.The front of the shade has 3 velcro straps that connects to the loops at the top of the windshield. My only gripe is that the middle velcro isn't perfectly aligned so you kind of have to wiggle it into place and pull it a bit before it can go into the loop. Not a big deal since I didn't see any issues with looseness at highway speeds. The shade does provide a noticeably cooler feel compared to direct sunlight.Another great thing about this larger model is that you can keep the rear hard top on while the sun shade is attached. See my photos - you can even strap it under the sound bar in a hurry. If you normally don't take the rear hard top off, you can go for the smaller model (Rugged Ridge 13579.04) that covers only the freedom panel portion.

Haven't installed yet because I'm waiting on brackets (I can't mount this as it's meant to with supplied brackets on my jeep since it's 52".. but I expected that) BUT just looking at it and handling it out of the package I can tell it's very sturdy and well-made. It looks so good in person, pictures do not do it justice. Selling points for me were the unique shape and details of the bezel itself, the red color, and the DRL function! Can't wait to get this thing installed! Comes with relay and harness. Wires are easily distinctive from one another in color. Will be a breeze to wire up. I could go on and on about it why this thing is great but I'll just say I am in love with this light bar already and it'll be a very unique and attractive addition to any 4x4 as well as effectively functional. Definitely recommend!

To All of you that now have one,I have at least every Schumacher made over the last15 - 20 years.Another one is arriving tomorrow.I won't go into what you already know,But I'll recommend what you should do from now on.Always operate these digital chargers from a power strip withindividual power switch at every power port. They have them here.There are strips with one switch for all ports, and will work fine.Again, I'll tell the best way.Now that you find charged battery reading 100%, switch it off, vs jerking the cord out of outlet.Let it time out 3-5 seconds, then turn it back on again.If it still reads 100%, you're ready to go.If the battery was in rough shape prior, it may now read anything but 100% when turned back on.So don't assume it's 100% the 1st round.It will go to a state of time out from hard chore of reconditioning it.The 2nd round should be correct.The only other issue, and this is normal for most Electronic voltage feed back controllers,They won't charge stone dead batteries.You'll need to put on jumper wires/cables to good battery to get dead battery up a few volts first for an hour.Now test with charger to see status, and if volts are indicated, charger should fire up and start chargingwhen battery choice and rate is chosen.I'm more than positive that this tip will save you years of battery care grief.You Guys on Cruisers Especially with added Driving lights.Don't head out w/o hitting battery to 100% with this at 8- 20 amps first, an hr before turning the key.Quit dinking around with .075 amp trickle chargers - that in the end, actually wrecked the lead platesto dust to the bottom of it's case.This charger and models similar will show you up front what the capacity is.Not 100%, then neither are you, and become a road hazard standing in middle of nowhere.They will save a lot of Alternator stress that's on the edge to recover starting and lights onat the same time.That's 45 yrs as Cycle tech and turbo bike drag racing.Where every molecule of power is tested.Have a Great Ride.I'll update with model of multi switched power strip a little later.And the charging cart I made with LED lights when rolling it out at night.Here is the 7 Switch Power Strip choice & there are a couple others less priced.http://www.amazon.com/TLP76MSG-Switched-Outlet-Conserve-Protector/dp/B0068LACFI/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1426637051&sr=1-2&keywords=7+Switched+Outlet+Strip

I sadly didn't apply mine too well and had a few bubbles I couldn't fully get out so mine looks slightly weathered which actually gives it a cool effect as if I've had a few encounters with imperial scum. This decal has held up sooooo well to all the elements of 100+ degree weather and below freezing and multiple hand and machine washes.

Bolted 2 of these down to the UWS toolbox I bought on amazon for my 2012 F150 Supercrew.  These hold my bike and lock therefore the perform their job flawlessly.  If you order multiple, the odds are not in your favor that they will be keyed alike.  I had a set of Yakima cores that are about 20 years old and those same SKS cores worked on these.  If you want them keyed alike, you may need to buy a set of SKS lock cores.

I used a pair of these on a 2003 Excursion.  I liked the fact that I got more head room beneath the raised glass gate.  But if you opened the gate and let go of it before the supports reached the end of their stroke the lift gate would slam pretty hard when the supports did reach full extension.  I was used to this and would keep my hand on the liftgate and allow it to slowly reach fully open so the supports didn't slam.  But I routinely stop for grocery pickup in this vehicle and the guys loading the groceries in the back would always just let go of it.The primary reason that I'm giving the struts only 3 stars is because one of them broke today, just over 11 months after they were installed.  As I pulled the liftgate down to close it the passenger side support popped off.  I found that the plastic end that engages the ball stud on the vehicle had broken.  And if you look at the picture of the opposite end, you can see that the plastic end that didn't break is severely bent out of position. I would anticipate that it would eventually fail as well.  The piston itself still works fine but is unusable with the broken end and will have to be replaced.  I would have expected to get at least 2-3 years use out of these.

First off,  I never give 5 stars.I was worried that the carrier wasn't welded, don't be. Solid as I've ever seen. Very heavy and difficult to carry, but I'd probably complain if it was light. Front wheel holder assembly is what puts this over the top. Quality product. Only 2 very small issues though.1. Holes where ramp attaches had to be reemed out just a hair2. Had a question and couldn't get a hold of customer support4.9 stars.

Initial review: Fits 2017 Harley Street Glide perfectly. With the fork locked, it fits tighter and the clips can't buckle. With the wheel straight, everything works as it should. I just put it on last night and haven't had any practical use of it yet to review.

Still going after almost 2 yrs. Only the black finish has faded over the years to a gold or bronze color. Don't know if it's due to heat, sunlight, or other but the LED's themselves are still good! Purchased in Nov 2016 and it's now Aug 2018. Thought one died last week but it had just loosened from the socket somehow. Good product

This helmet is great. Really snug and thick cheek cushions but that's what I wanted. I don't want my helmet to move around. Visibility is really awesome and the best of all helmets in my opinion. See pic, I have the smoke mirrored iridium lens. I love it. It is so bright and clear to see out of with no glare. If you ride fast and want a great protective lightweight helmet that looks amazing, buy this carbon fiber Race Star. I'm glad I did. I was really worried about what size to get. I have a narrow head but it's kinda long so most hemets wobble side to side. This helmet is designed for a more narrow head and the thick check pads keep it snug. Over time, the cheek pads contoured not to my exact size because they compressed some. Yes, it's so snug that it was super tight on the checks the first few rides but over time it compresses to be snug but not too tight and you get used to it too. I personally like it that way. I measured my head size and I was just at the top measurement for a medium so I went with the large and it worked well for me since my head is more long than round to get the size. I love this helmet. The way the visor connects is awesome too. Best design ever. The clear visor that it comes with is good for night but buy another visor because you cannot where sunglasses with this helmet! No slots in the padding for them. Hey, it's a race helmet. Oh, and the way the visor looks shut is awesome too. I had another helmet and slightly turned my head at high speeds over 120mph and the visor flew open... not fun. This one is looked into place and with all the vents, this helmet breathes well. Hope this helps.

First of all this is my second purchase from Kensun and their HID bulb kit worked great for me without any issues for over 2 years. I purchased the LED kit for my wife's 2015 Nissan Murano due to it coming with the yellow halogen bulbs from factory.The bulbs perform well and are noticeably brighter than the halogens with a bright white clean color projecting from the headlight. Four months passed and the passenger side headlight burned out. I contacted Kensun and they happily sent out a pair of new bulbs.I put in the new bulbs today and they work as good as the first set. The new set is different and made with black metal versus stainless. Hopefully they updated their design. I'm unsure what happened but it appears that the headlight overheated and actually burned out.No damage to my actual housing but in some cars it could have melted out the housing. 4 stars due to one burning out already and the glass coverings only tint the light. I suggest removing them for better heat dissapation and light transmission.

After installing the lights, it really looked great - right up to the time the some LEDs failed.  Some of the LEDs failed just four weeks after installation.So far I have had very good customer service through Amazon.  I elected to get a replacement and see what happens.

Nice to ride new feeling again ..Dont mess around replace them , they are your suspension system and can adversely affect the ride and safety.. seems to me its a common failure on the passenger side first.

Got this for my 2015 Ram 1500.  When i first got it and held it to my steering wheel the cover looked very undersized.  I tried installing it anyways to no luck.I then did what many suggested and the instructions says...placing it in sunlight for a few hours.  I came back to a warm and malleable cover.  I then proceeded to put the cover on and with a little of muscle it went on!  It would deff be easier installing with an extra set of hands but I just used my knee to hold the cover in one spot, then used my hands stretching the rest on.  There is a good YouTube video out there for installation of a similar product.  The cover will fit!  Dont get discouraged.

I wanted to give my 09 K1500 Silverado a lift without going too radical by installing a large lift kit.  Even though big lift kits look awesome when done the right, is a fairly extensive job that requires bigger modifications to the frame and suspension and lets not forget  to mention higher cost for most larger lift kits.I was in the market for a nice lift that was more than a basic "level kit" with small spacers between the lower control arms and front shocks and high enough to make room for the tires I purchased.  I had Falken Wildpeak A/T3W LT275/70R18 tires (33.5 x 11.00R18) that I wanted on the truck and ordered Ultra Predator II 18 x 9 inch wheels through my Amazon account at the same time as this kit. I didn't want any clearance problems or modifications to my front air dam or GM molded mud flaps. This kit did the trick and exceeded my expectations!!!Let me start out by saying that I'm an ex automotive technician so I knew what I was getting into before I started this project. Even though I have previous experience, this was my  the first time of taking on the challenge of installing a small lift kit so I did some research though several forums and youtube videos, especially since I have seen other comments that the provided instructions are not the best.The kit is fairly self explanatory however, if you purchase the MotoFab kit which raises the front 3 inches and the rear 2 inches,  you'll have to remove the front sway bar links and disconnect the upper ball joints from the steering knuckles. This kit is too tall to try and do the cheat-method by only loosing the links and upper ball joint studs.  Once everything is disconnected and the front spring/shock assemblies are removed, you will have to cut off the upper control arm bump-stops in order to re-connect the upper ball joint into the steering knuckle after the front shock  spacers are installed. This isn't probably necessary with smaller kits that are also available though Amazon and MotoFab. The slight modification is not a huge deal to do and I found that using a cut-off wheel on a die-grinder to cut them off does the trick fairly quickly and easily.  After cutting off the bump-stops, I then smoothed the cut-out areas with grinder  to eliminate any sharp edges and used a little undercoating spray to protect the exposed areas from corroding.  With the bump-stops removed and the front shocks with the new spaces in place, it allows  the upper control arms enough downward movement to get the ball joint stud though the steering knuckle and the stud nut started.  From this point all you need to do is finish the reassembly of the front end.When it came to installing the rear blocks, the new lift blocks were an easy swap out from the factory ones, just make sure you only do one side at a time or you may run into re-assembly alignment issues.The total project took me about 4hrs to do but depending on your mechanical skills and available tools/equipment  to do the job, it may take you more or less time. It does help to have a second set of hands, especially when your re-connecting the front upper control arms to the steering knuckles.You will need to have the vehicle re-aligned after the kit is installed and if your going to put aftermarket wheels/tires on your truck, install them after its been aligned. A lot of aftermarket wheels don't have a recessed rim lips or make it easy to install alignment machine heads onto the outer rim edges which could make it difficult to align and/or mar-up your new wheels. I knew this ahead of time so I aligned the truck with the original rims/tires then put my new wheels on.After everything was installed and aligned the truck look awesome and the ran down the road with no problems. I think the ride feels  even better than before the kit was installed with no rough or bumpy feel going over rugged terrain.Attached are before and after pictures the truck so you can see the difference this kit made along with the new wheels/tires.I cannot say enough about the quality of this kit (With A+++ that it's American Made!!!) and the price is a bargain at $125.00 when comparing to similar kits from other companies!I would highly recommend this kit and company to anyone looking for a new look to their truck!!!!

I was really impressed with the results I got using the 303 Tonneau Cover & Convertible Top Cleaner. I have an older car with a canvas top that has lost its ability to repel water. It started to get green with mildew spots and was looking terrible. I spot tested the worst part of my convertible top with the 303 cleaner, following the directions and it totally removed the heavy mildew/mold that was covering that part of the top. There is still some green embedded deep in the tops fibers, but I think that after another cleaning with 303 cleaner might get most of embedded mold out. I will definitely be cleaning my whole top with the 303 Tonneau Cover & Convertible Top Cleaner, and then take the next step and apply the 303 Fabric Guard to the top so it repels the water like it used to. This product does a good job, I will be using it from now on.

Looks black to me. Some said grey...but before and after heat install...its black.  I used to "black out" the headlight eyebrows and this applies well. The seller emailed detailed tips/instructions on how to best apply the vinyl. I liked how it could stretch and bend upon application since the area covering was curved. Add a little heat with a hair dryer and looks cherry! I'm no pro, but for what I needed, it looks great and got plenty left over.

This item was provided for review and consumer analysisYou know when you consider all you gasoline choices, you have many to choose from? They will all make your car go, but what exactly is the difference? Chevron, Texico, Shell, etc.they all have gas, but is one better than the other?What you learn is that they ALL get their gas from the same source. There is no difference. What are different is the additives and detergents used by each company in their fuel, but the base fuel itself is all the same. You see the same practice with many products on the market where the base product is the same as many others, but have been rebadged.When you dig into the world of LED light bars, you will find this is no different. You have many to choose from, and they range greatly in price, but exactly are you getting for these prices?This is where the advantage of bang for your buck really comes into play. The key is to finding a well-constructed LED light bar for a balanced price. After doing some extensive research, I have found that a great majority of the LED light bars come from the same sources, and then are rebadged.LED light bars that are sold by U.S. based companies are often sold for a premium. A 30 inch light bar may sell for $500 where as a lesser known brand with the EXACT same parts sells for $100.00Some may argue that you get good customer service and a warranty with the U.S. Company, which may be, however at a fraction of the overall cost, is it worth it? Especially considering both are made with the same components? What you end having is a U.S. based company taking the same foreign parts, and then assembling them state side and slapping their brand on it. Its important to remember, this is NOT made in the U.S. This only means it was assembled in the U.S.Its becoming common practice these days to say assembled in the U.S. as a way to try and maintain that Made in the USA label so many wish or strive for. However, why pay a premium on something as if it were made in the U.S. when this clearly is not the case?Most of the time, the saying you get what you pay for does hold pretty true, however in the world of LED light bars, there appears to be a market where many line up and shell out hundreds of dollars for name brand LED light bars that are trending in the various off road circles. Many feel the need to justify the hundreds spent on these lights, but often when stacked up against lesser known brands with the same components, we get comparable performance at a much affordable price.This is where I have found Auxbeam is in their element. Using the same quality housings, parts and components that much more expensive mainstream brands use, Auxbeam provides a diverse selection of light bars that perform amazingly well for the price.When it comes to this 21 inch Osram fish eye curved light bar by Auxbeam, they once again have provided a well-rounded and solid built product at a very affordable price.Build QualityThis light has an aluminum housing that appears to be very durable. Weighing in at 6 pounds, its not terribly heavy, but the weight alone is clearly indicative of the quality construction. Its not super lightweight like found on cheaply made lights with inferior components. It features a rugged built in heat sink on the back which seem to do an adequate job keeping the heat of the light to a minimum, prolonging the life of the light bar.The hardware used is stainless steel and does well in the elements. This light comes with included side mounts, which are very solid and well made. The lenses and overall construction are solid and appear to be made with careful attention to detail in how it was put together. Cheaper lights on the market often are made with poor results, showing misaligned reflectors, seals, etc. None of that is seen with this light. So far, everything appears to be done with quality and performance in mind.Where Auxbeam could theoretically cut corners, such as the mounting hardware included, they dont, which is a nice testament to their dedication to the product line. Other companies have resorted to using cheaper materials for their mounts and brackets, which is not the case here, which is greatly appreciated.The wiring is also good quality, and come with a nice rubberized loom to protect it from the elements.This lightbar has an internal weather seal, which so far has done a great job keeping out moisture and the elements. According to Auxbeam, these are shock proof, impact resistant, and waterproof. So far, I have seen little reason to doubt these claims. While testing, I have put these lights through mud, hot, cold, snow, off road, on road, and everything in between. Not once have I ever seen any indication of poor construction of product failure.The only time I have ever seen the slightest indication of condensation, is when a high pressure car wash is used. I always recommend with ANY light product, to wrap the light in plastic or a bag before taking them through high pressure washes. While typically they hold up fine, there is no reason to put the light under such stress when it can be avoided with a little prep before deep cleaning your vehicle.PerformanceWhen it comes to performance, this light does a great job. Its important however there are key differences between Cree style light bars, and Osram styles. Cree light bars are often more diverse and throw their light in a more spread out pattern, with flood being of higher efficience then spot distance. The Osram fish eye style light is for people who are wanting to throw light at a farther distance overall. If you need something that project way out ahead, then the Osram may be just what you're looking for. Ideally, you could install both a Cree style and Osram light bar on your vehicle to get a balanced combination of both ambient flood as well as distance spotting. Picking the right LED bar is all about the task your needing to perform. Like anything, its choosing the right tool for the job, and all LED light bars are not created equal.Many assume they are all basic in task and purpose, but this is not so, the difference between the light output of both Cree and Osram and very distinct and specific. If you look at the photos in this review, you can see where we compared the light throw from a Cree light bar to that of the Osram light bar here, both made by Auxbeam. While its hard to fully appreciate the reality of the light these bars put out through photos, they provide a decent reference that shows these differences.Beware of Counterfeits It should be stressed that Teammade Auxbeam is the ONLY authorized dealer. There are sellers listing Auxbeam lights on Amazon, however they are generic lights and have nothing to do with Auxbeam. These lights often have no identifying marks, use inferior materials such as plastic, and are constructed very poorly. People are ordering what they believe to be legitimate products, only to be disappointed when opening the package. After examining a legitimate Auxbeam light next to a fake model, its very apparent how poorly the counterfeit item is. Without having first seen the original however this can be difficult for someone to discern. Please protect yourself from being taken advantage from double check who fulfills the order.Pros' Competitively priced, often hundreds less then mainstream name brand lights constructed with the same components.' Built with solid materials and quality construction' Warranty on parts' Performs better or as well as mainstream brand lights of similar build and design' Low watt power draw, doesnt put high demand on power system' Water proof, dust proof, shock proofConsNone at this time.ConclusionIn conclusion, this is a great product for the money. Its not often that I come across products that earn a 5 star review with no areas to give hard criticism. It can be honestly stated this product earns high marks for its price bracket and what it offers in its class. You can literally buy 3 of these for the price of one mainstream name brand of light of similar build and quality. With the included warranty and great service backed by Amazon, this really is a no brainer. As a now retired first responder myself, I would have no reservations at all with this mounted on my patrol vehicle for use in the field.This Product was provided by Auxbeam for consumer analysis.

Product appears to be good quality. There are a couple small fitment issues that need attention though. I had to trim a bracket corner for clearance, and the hitch pushes up on the lower valance of the bumper by a bit. If the hitch was lower by about a half inch I think both issues would be resolved.I also wasn't impressed with the hardware it came with. It will probably be sufficient but some oem style hardware woulda been nice. Cheap non-graded flat and lock washers.

Good product, finishes nicely. I see a few questions out there about it's aggressiveness in comparison to other meguiar's products and thought I could help shed some light on the subject. Without sounding too redundan m85, m101, and m105 do the same job.the difference between the three is its application.By design M85 is for rotary buffing only.M101 is for random orbital buffing with foam application pads.M105 is for random orbitalbuffing with microfiber application pads.So when your looking for that next best compound keep in mind, a compound is only as good as it's application finding the balance between the 2 is up to you.Thank you.

The front screw holes are one size too small to get all the holes to line up. I used a stepper but and made them just a bit bigger and they went on fine. The back mudguards two holes line up fine. I wasn't going to put the optional third screw in as I didn't want to drill a hole. The 3m tape is too thin to get a good grab on the metal. So I had to drill just to get the top portion flush against the truck. I drilled the 1/8 hole and tried to screw the included optional screw in. IT BROKE IN THE DRILLED HOLE!  I then had to drill out the broken screw piece. The screw seems to made of very mild metal. It broke with me using my hand screw driver. The screw driver then scratched the paint when the screw broke. After fixing the above problems the mud guards do look great but too much trouble getting there!  If you buy these do your self a favor and drill the front holes in the mudflaps a little bigger and plan on drilling a hole at the top of the rear mudflaps and ignore the skinny 3m tape. Be very careful with the supplied screws too!

So you're paying 70 bucks for a wiper arm made in China. Packaging inside of the box says "made in China and the bag that is protecting the wiper arm says made in Germany (lol) I'm not complaining, just saying. Well, I'm not gonna lie, it looks well made and OEM though. I'm going to give it some time but hopefully it won't break easily. Worth the money? Maybe.

Great product for oil changes.Very sturdy. Has handles.Has a lip around the rim so oil will not spill out.Has a spout to accurately pour the oil into a recyclable jug! This might be my favorite part.This thing is large, so do not worry about filling it up too much, holds 16 liters! My truck holds 7 liters for comparison.Inexpensive, i purchased this for about $12 i believe.Do it.

Light bar is very bright for the price. Have have on my truck for about a month now. Installed on my 03 Silverado and fits in factory bolt holes. Was very impressed once it was installed to find that the bars light reaches far and has a wide beam of light. Has somewhat of a bluish tint as well as white light. Overall very happy with this purchase. Have had no water or moisture issues since I've bought this.

Aside from what is already on the bike, and what Indian sells, there aren't too many chrome accessories left to personalize the bike with.This looks great, she was thrilled! The quality seems to be worthy of the bike so my immediate impression is favorable. Let's see how it wears. We live right on the coast so it should be a good test. ;)

I got this to put on the pin box of my 5th wheel in addition to the OEM one. This one will apply the brakes on my second trailer using the camper's batteries if the camper ever comes unhooked. The second trailer has its own full set of connections to the truck through the a customer electrical hook up on the camper and a second brake controller is installed in the truck. This will just hook between the battery hot in the camper and the brake controller wire for the second trailer.

This is the first time I've tried this product. It went on very easy with the supplied applicator and was easy to remove after setting for about 30 minutes. Don't put it on too thick because it may take a little more pressure to remove in colder weather. My cars look great. I love this wax! I attached photos of my Hot Red and Black Sapphire Kia's. They look like glass and the paint is as soft as silk.

Took me nearly 2 hours to finish sewing. Package came with 2 piece of long threads. Car owned Honda Civic 2015.Used the first thread to stitch close knits around the steering. This leaves slack at the end at many places. (See first image). Used the second thread to tie off slacks. (See second image)Pros:- Good quality grip. Not too rubber, just perfect- Easy to stitchCons:- Clumsy thread- Ships from china. Took more than a month

Nice part, solid aluminum and great price. Why not 5 stars? I will explain: the listed diameter is of the *edges*, but not of the pipe body. That should be listed (maybe by including a diagram with the dimension?). In my case, I ordered the part expecting the pipe to be 28mm diameter, but instead it had 25.92mm and that made it unsuitable for my application.The edges have 27.86mm (which would be ok). I ordered the next size (30mm) and hope it should do the trick.Also keep in mind that the hole for installing the sensor is a bit rough (as mentioned by another reviewer), but I feel it won't be a problem.Update:I'm downgrading it to 3 stars. I received the 30mm part and it worked for my application, *but* installing the water temperature sensor in the provided hole was quite difficult (as another reviewer mentioned, it won't fit a standard 1/8 NPT threaded sensor like the ones sold by Autometer together with their gauges).In my case, I managed to make it fit, but it required to use WD-40 to lub, over 40Nm of torque and tedious work (screw in a little bit, remove the sensor, clean, lub and repeat).

Wow, this is a great way to avoid having to replace the entire sensor assembly in your wheel.I got this in hope I could repair the valve stem on my Jeep Wrangler JK (2009). The other option was to buy the entire TPMS sensor and reprogram the car for the new sensor. That would have been $100+ at the dealer (sensor is $80 plus tax and $15 for programming the car for the new sensor, plus the labor for the tire removal, sensor replacement and installation).Instead the dealer (Jeep dealer) was open to replaceing the valve stem, especially since I had brought it in. They don't stock these at the dealer since they wouldn't make much money on them and they may not even know they exist until I showed up with it this morning. Thanks to the Internet and user forums for opening my options to doing this instead.A couple of things to be aware of1) this is just the valve stem. It's a hollow tube. You need to put in a valve core. If your stem is damaged like mine was, you will need need to replace the core. As it turns out, my dealer was awesome and had a spare core they gave me!2) this valve stem (service pack) is going to be specific to the model of TMPS you have. I did some research on the internet and found the Schrader web site and found the model of valve stem for my year make and model. Other cars/trucks may be different, so do your research, it'll save you the headache of getting the wrong one.The Schrader page for researching your replacement is here: [...]

The Curt Trailer Hitch Cover fit way too loose in my U-Haul 1 1/4" Trailer Hitch. However, this was easily remedied. I shoved a large rubber cane/furniture tip into the recess on the back of the Curt Trailer Hitch Cover. I drilled them both and secured the cane/furniture tip to the Curt Trailer Hitch Cover with a small bolt and nut, and trimmed down the protruding cane/furniture tip to match the Hitch Cover. This bulged out the sides of the Curt Hitch Cover so that now it fits very snugly into my U-Haul Trailer Hitch. I also secured a short piece of chain to the Hitch Cover with the bolt too. The other end of the chain slips over the hitch receiver bolt before the lock is attached so the Hitch Cover does not get lost. SEE MY PHOTOS ABOVE.

I did not purchase this on amazon as it was too $.  I got it for much less and there is a $50 rebate at the time as well.  Installation was done with a drill, angle grinder, some basic hand tools and a good 4-5 hours of work.  The instructions provided are VERY good.  We're talking color instructions that span over 20 pages, so it's very detailed and well put together in that regard.I can't vouch for the durability of the product just yet, but if you are just mall-crawling this will work to keep the mud/snow/water off your truck with MTRs.  they remove a lot of material fore and aft of the fender and maybe only 1/2 to 1" from the top of the fender.  You will cut up SOME of the pinch seams in the rear but not much.  I purchased underbody coating to spray the areas I trimmed and/or cut.the installation reuses the factory holes as mounting and guide points.  If you've already cut up your fenders then these won't work for you.They seem fairly strong but not that flexible.  They are a thin hard plastic with an inner mount/bracket.  You can make your rig move by on these hard enough.  I don't intend to take these up against a tree or rock so don't ask me how durable they will be for that.  I'll do mild crawling and a lot of fire trails etc.Overall I'm happy with them and I really like the styling.  Very TJ-ish.  Feel free to check out the pics of the blue XJ i posted (mine)

Replacing OEM PIAA Xtreme White bulbs in PIAA 2100XT lights with fog lens.  Great lamp but bulbs always burn out in about 6-9 months and $40 replacement?  Tried PIAA replacement and it burned out  in less than a year.  To spend $40/year on bulbs for a light that costs $100 is . . .Would prefer whiter light but expensive and unreliable PIAA bulbs aren't an option.  So bought this pair for $10 because I expect to be replacing the left side soon.In picture, "glaring" bulb on vehicle right is Hella versus PIAA left.  Slightly deceptive as it suggests greater illumination and less beam focus.  Actual cutoff and illumination is virtually identical but Hella has decidedly yellow tint.

1993 Jeep YJ.  Purchased a set of these to replace the stock white covers that came with my Hella 500s.  Wanted to be able to use the lights without having to get out and remove the stock covers.  I have had them on now for about 2 months in one of the harshest climates they could possibly be in -- the AZ desert.  It's been super hot and sunny out here, and we have gravel & other debris all over the highways all the time.  I would expect that leaving the vehicle outside in the heat and direct sun for long periods of time, along with traveling at 70 MPH behind other vehicles, would be a pretty good test for these things.No problems thus far.  Any gravel that has been thrown up has been deflected.  Since they are mounted on a hoop above my front bumper, I would have to be ramming trees for any damage to be done that way, and I'm not ramming trees, so in good shape there.They seem very functional since I can use the lights without removing the covers, and very durable since the lights are still ding-free.  I haven't even noticed any scuffs on the covers so far!My ONLY gripe -- I have the lights mounted upside down in my center hoop.  Since the covers cannot be flipped, the Hella logos are now upside down.  It's not a big deal, but would be nice to be able to flip the covers so the logos are right side up.

READ BEFORE PURCHASING....15march2016:So I was very skeptic when I first got this thru the mail. I did took it apart and see the internals before installing. The rubber diaphram looks like a good quality. There is a port inside that you can change the diameters going to the return line and this kit does come with two other size. It fit directly onto my stock fuel rail. My engine is a B18C1. I had to use my stock bolts because the bolt that came with kit was a different thread pattern. 5 star is what I'm giving it right now. Hope it doesn't crap out on me.Update: 4april2016So today my engine flodded and fuel shot out of the vacuum port. Lucky fuel didn't ignite and I didn't use race fuel yet. The diaphram inside ripped. It sucks cause I was about to take it on the dyno tomorrow. I was running on stock fuel pressure at 42psi w/ vacuum and 52psi w/out. Unfortunately I can't return or replace due to the purchase date being made on 1march2016 and today is 4april2016. I miss the 30 day window. I should've known that it was about to go when it wasn't holding pressure on start up. I would have to press the throttle some for it to start and today when I turned it on my car rumble and died. When I pop the hood open it was shooting fuel. I removed my spark plug on cylinder 1 and check for flooding with my probe camera and there was significant amount of fuel. Lucky it happened at home instead of getting stuck on the highway. I changed it into 1star from my orgianal review of 5star due to safety reason. That's what I get for cutting corners and trying to be cheap. I'm gonna have to suck it up and get me a better one specially when it comes to fuel.Hope this review helps.

In my household and having Three cars,you tend to  hear this statement"does the tire look low to you" once in a while and of course,the answer is always "not sure,check it out" which means either use the inaccurate pen tire gauge or take trip to the nearest Gas Station to check the tires and fill them up with Air if needed!! And now with the cold weather you do need to check your tires more often! Enough with the Drama,when I got a chance to test and review This Monster of a Tire Pressure Gauge,never hesitated and took the dive!!Build/Quality:-------------------When compared to my old gauge(pictured bellow) the Qeeph Gauge blew the competition away! The old one was a struggle to get the right angle to fit into tire,not to mention having to read three to four times and get an average number of pressure reading,then numbers are not so clear to read. One other thing worth mentioning,the Air release button that is built in,whereas with the old one you have to it take out and manually releasing some of the extra air out,plug in again for another reading,and so forth and so on. The Qeeph tire pressure gauge is gloved by a rubber housing which acts as a shock proof in case you drop it or even to be thrown into a tool box and not having to worry about it a bit. The other one has to be treated like a pen in your shirt pocket!!!Operation:---------------Plug in and read is best to describe the operation of this gauge. The head rotates instead of you having to rotate your hand to get the best angle!It can be used on Car,Motorcycle and Bicycle tires or any tire that needs to be filled with air constantly.Conclusion:-----------------Gauge is really Heavy Duty and built to take a beating and last. After testing it for a while I can't but to praise this must have Gadget and I totally recommend it to others. I did get this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. Also worth noting that I am an Amazon shopper just like you,worked very hard for the money I shop with,and I depend on reviews when shopping online. So I do NOT write favorable reviews for providing source,because I trust that others are giving honest reviews on products I intend to buy as well! I hope you find my review helpful in making /breaking your decision about buying this product,if so please hit that YES button while you're at it, Happy shopping :)

These are not "really" warm color compared next to an incandescent but they also aren't bright white or blue/white.I had one in the mix that was blue/white and flickering, I contacted zone tech who quickly sent me out a replacement.We've had these on in the night now for about a month, I would recommend these as well as buy again.

You couldn't build a ladder rack cheaper than they sell this one for. This rack is built very robustly and the paint job was done very well. The rack was very easy to install and the manual had easy-to-follow instructions.In addition to the rack it also came with all of the needed hardware, which was 8 bolts, 16 washers, and 8 nuts. The rack also includes tie-down handles on each section so that you can secure cargo. This unit is only rated at 500 lbs, however, it feels and looks built to handle much more than that.This ladder rack paid for itself in the first use. I needed to transport some 16ft 2x6s home and Lowes wanted to charge me $65 to do so. I can now transport lumber and long ladders safely.

They worked great for me. The h1 bulbs aren't the brightest, however I was using a cheap hid kit. I'm assuming a good hid would would be plenty bright. They were a lot of work to install and a lot of time fussing with wiring and relays was required to make it work in my Ford crown Victoria, but it was totally worth it because the finished product was beautiful. Recieved lots of compliments and lots of people wondering where I got them. The off white/purple light of the halo is really a nice colour and looked stunning as my daytime running lights. Everyone that's seen them loved them as much as I do and I'm sure if you are willing to put in the time and effort to install them it will be worth it. Can't say anything for the customer service, never had to deal with them

This is an excellent product for the price and at a fraction of a the cost  buying it at a dealership. I installed the new lid in 15 minutes without having to remove the entire console. You just need to recline your seats all way back in order to have plenty of room to work with. I pulled up a YouTube video and they walked me through the Insulation which made it a lot easier so I would highly recommend this product as a replacement lid for your GM truck. And the genuine leather looks and feels really good.

I waited almost a year to review these.  These are. Hands down. The best tires I have ever had.  I have almost 15k miles on them and you can hardly tell that any tread is missing.  They have been on pavement, concrete, dirt, gravel and grass.  I almost got stuck one time.  But if you take it slow the tread will dig in and get you a good grip.... UPDATE.  The photos are the tires with 30k miles.

This is just as described I mounted it on my 2015 GMC Sierra crew cab short bed I needed to trim 2 inches off the length to get it to fit and I used 3M Fastener TB3571/TB3572 instead of the screws that came with it. (did not want to drill holes in the tailgate) and I'm happy with the purchase.

I installed this on my daughter's 2004 Jeep Liberty. Initially, I thought it was built better than OEM and would not present any problems due to its design. The install went fine and everything appeared to function as it should. Being that this was the rear passenger window on the driver's side, it saw VERY little use.  We had a pretty rainey winter, so most of the time, all windows in the vehicle stayed in the up position. With the advent of summer, my daughter decided to roll her windows down while driving for some fresh warm air. She told me that this was the first time in many months that she had rolled the rear window down. Now, the window is stuck in the open position.I inspected the door and window assembly and found that the wire housing and spring which holds the cable for operation has come off, either it broke or stretched, I wasn't exactly certain but, it was obvious know that the unit HAD FAILED.  After close inspection and removal, I discovered that the cables had kinked and bunched up at the pulley area. No matter what I tried, I could not get the cables to straighten out. My best guess is that one of the cables  detached or broke off at the sliding mechanism, causing the wires to bunch up as they did.I'm with Doccraw on this one... You might want to search elsewhere for a regulator. Preferably with a better design or more sturdy parts that are not made of plastic.In the meantime, I have requested a replacement from the seller as, in the product info under the warranty section, it claims to carry a 12 month warranty.  I know that sometimes parts fail but, if the replacement part fails again, or if the seller doesn't honor the 12 month warranty,  I'll update this review with the outcome.

Bought these running boards to replace the old rusted out OEM boards I had taken off. Finally got around to installing after 6 months sitting in the garage. Directions aren't very good, but it's an easy install once you get underneath the truck. Wish I hadn't procrastinated so long!

I've tried twice to submit a review and both times received an error and they were deleted. Hopefully, the third time, is a charm.I bought these to replace the sealed beams, on my hobby truck, a 2006 F250. I couldn't be happier the results. They are much better than the originals. I paired them with PIAA 50/55w lights and I can actually see the road.I had two difficulties changing them, one was my fault, the other was due to rusted screws holding together the light bezel and headlight cup that attach. The screws were so rusted that even soaking in homemade ATF/Acetone penetrating solution wouldn't loosen them. So fortunately Dorman makes aftermarket bezels and I had to hit the Ford dealer for the cups. No big deal just an added cost. The other problem was on my end. They come with nice rubber boots to attach to the rear of the light. In a rush to install them,  as it was getting too dark to see, I ripped one. Totally my fault.This is where the company shone customer service wise. I emailed them late on a Sunday asking to buy a new rubber boot. Since it was my ineptitude that caused the problem I was happy to pay for one. They got back to me the next day and offered to send one for free! YAY! Awesome customer service! Two days coast to coast and I had the new boot along with a nice window sticker.They seem solidly built. There are some dark spots which I was able to mostly eliminate through bulb positioning and alignment. Still 100x better than the old ones.In all I couldn't be happier with the purchase, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them, to anyone in the market for sealed beam conversions.

This wiper blade fit my 2012 Tiguan perfectly and wipes quietly and with no streaks.  I don't understand why some others cost 2-3 times as much, especially when Valeo is an OEM manufacturer. Installing was super easy, you just lift the wiper arm away from the window, slide the cover in the direction away from the attachment point, then swivel the blade and unsnap it from the arm.  Installing the new blade is just a reversal of the process.Recommended!

I did not see any reviews for marine applications and no mention about these lights being 100% waterproof. That being said, here we go... Amber LED mounted to the nose of my favorite Kayak. To be on the safe and dry side, I gave everything a nice thick blob of Aquaseal. This does a great job of protecting my "under the waterline" lights.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/M-Essentials-Aquaseal-Urethane-Repair-Adhesive/dp/B000NIG1Z2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">M Essentials Aquaseal Urethane Repair Adhesive</a>So far, so good!

This is an easy install; most of the effort involves removing the fairings from the bike. It would have been nice if the instructions had included the factory torque specs (they simply say "torque to manufacturer's spec," so I had to go look them up). Otherwise, no issues, and they look good.

Used it for about 6 months. By the second month it was already gray (instead of black you will se a picture were you can see the color fade). That was a bad sign but still worked. Then 2 weeks ago I found a rip in the top part of it so I applied tape to it. Today there were 3 more rips one of those of about 4 feet long! Almost divided the cover in two. I would not recommend this. Check the pictures.

Exactly the color temperature I was expecting, I got to say.. at first one of the bulbs stop working and I was pretty upset about it, but I cantacted Kensun and asked to return the bulbs, they reply the same day and offered me a new pair of bulbs for free and told me that if I had any problems, they will refund my money back. Haven't had any problems so far with my lights, very satisfied with their exellent costumer service.

What I received was not the clean steel items shown.  My baffles were already rusty which did not inspire confidence in the product, or make me feel good about spending over $40 on each baffle.  There are zero instructions or any information about the product in the box so you had better be mechanically minded and have some common sense.  The fiber glass dampener material is held to the baffle with shrink wrap; do you leave it on or remove it?? If you remove it, how will you easily insert the baffle?  I took off the wrap and used thin steel wire to hold the fiber glass to the baffle.  The baffles are packaged in a polythene tube, not a bag, so watch out or they will fall and hit the floor.Other than that, the product is good, very easy to install, and performs as expected.

These battery terminal covers are just right for all sizes of top-post batteries. A slit with a razor blade will allow the covers to be installed over odd-shaped terminals -- and a tie-wrap (not included) holds each cover in place.

It works. Bah, I know you want more information, but there is only so much you can say about an OBDII reader. If you haven't seen these bluetooth ones before I highly recommend picking one up as an impulse purchase. Gone are the days of paying to get the error codes scanned on your car. I know some places will scan them for free but as everyone has a smartphone these days there's no reason to even leave the house.Just plug the vice into your OBDII port and turn the car on. This will power it up and allow your phone to find it. Tell it to pair and put the pairing code in(1234 in this case) and you're good to go. At this point the data is being sent to your phone but you'll need an app that knows what to do with it. I personal use(and think the best one is) the Torque app but there are others.It's not only for error codes though. These can aid in troubleshooting the problems themselves. Every car is a little different but any data that is put out by your car can be read and displayed. That means you don't only have to use these for business; fun is an option too. Where some people may pick expensive gauges to mount in various locations; you can just open the app and display lots of information right on the screen. If for instance you use the Torque app you can customize multiple screens and swipe between them.A tip for you: I have a Nexus 7 that I put in a cheap case super-glued magnets on. After gluing magnets to the inside of the center of my dash I can pop it there any time and read the data this reader is sending. While there are many hit-or-miss clones of these devices out there I found this one to work just fine. The screenshot from my phone is while it was showing data pulled from this very reader. Looks like these are good ones. I received this product free in exchange for nothing more than my honest opinion.

Seems to be just denatured alcohol in a small bottle that does the exact same thing as denatured alcohol on hot glue. Smells the same, looks the same, works the same. I did a side by side comparison with this product and denatured alcohol and the results were exactly the same. Feeling incredibly ripped off at the moment.

These side steps by Tyger are great. They have a rough flat black texture and give my 2016 Dodge Ram Big Horn a great look. They are pretty heavy too, about 50 lbs each. My son and I installed in a couple hours taking our time. Very happy with this purchase.

Used all 4 bottles on the bed and bumper of a Nissan mini truck and ended up with a 1-2mm thick coating.  Could have used 1 more bottle to ensure even coverage.  On large trucks you will want to use 2 kits - which pushes you close to half the price of a real spray in bedliner.  Textures up nicely - dries rough and rock hard.  That said I don't think this will be as durable as LineX or Rhino Lining as those coatings are more rubberized and flexible.  However the Raptor Liner is easy enough to touch up if it does get a scratch - time will tell.  Used the U-Pol schutz gun to apply with a 20 gallon compressor and regulator set at 60 psi (works out to 50 psi with the trigger pulled on the gun) and it worked well, took 3 good passes with 60 minutes flash time between coats.  Acetone works best for cleanup and do clean the gun immediately after use - this is a thick 2k paint and will clog it up for sure.  To clean the insides of the gun I stuck the straw into the can of Acetone and sprayed.All told, if one factors in the cost of supplies- you will need acetone, drop cloths, masking tape, paper, and most important - a respirator - plus buying a schutz gun and the product , AND your time (with prep this will take an entire Saturday), LineX is probably a better option.  But for those DIYers that already have the stuff and your time isn't worth much this is the best of the DIY liner options.

Awesome product especially for the price! When compared to the exact same kit from HD, you save hundreds (even with my employee discount)! Install only took about 30 mins, & that includes making my clutch adjustment, and greasing all pivot points. Would highly recommend!

These look good on my 2010 FX4, though looking back, I wish i had purchased side bars that are completely stainless steel all around.These are only SS on one side, the top side and to me seams like it is very thin on the SS (Stainless Steel). The underside is a ABS plastic of some sort. The best part of these steps are the mounting brackets are heavy duty!i will order the Westin Pro Traxx all SS next time around.

Best "cleaner" I've used in over 40-years, for getting rid of scuff-marks, bird-dropping stains, sneaker marks from road-grime, the black-streaks that drip from canvas (pretty sure it's jet-fuel / pollution), spider-marks, ALL OF IT GONE!  This is more aggressive than boat-washes and will strip wax from the hull, so be sure to follow it up with a high-quality wax before droppings have a chance to reattach to the exposed surface.  I use a buffer (medium "orange" pad, 1000RPM max), but it works equally well by hand.  I had a bird poop on a section of the hull cleaned by this, that I left exposed overnight (ran out of time to apply wax before nightfall), and it took 20-minutes to re-clean that spot, so I'm dead-serious that you don't want to use this unless you intend to apply a coat-or-two of wax immediately following.

There were awesome at first. Two months some LEDs died. And now the same thing on other side. These are junk!****UPDATE**** bought these again but this time instead of clipping the nub off I drilled a tiny hole on the bumper so itll fit in. Used dielectric greased on the plug as well. I feel that those who clipped off the nub, that allowed moisture to go through the screw hole and burnt out the LEDs. So well see if the new way I installed will work.

So I am 4k miles into this tire on my Dyna and I have to say, I am impressed. I have rode through pouring rain, sand, dirt, hot and almost freezing. This tire sticks better then the Dunlop 402 that cames on this bike and appears to be lasting longer as well. Great buy can't recommend it enough. Picture of tire is current with 4k miles

As many DIY mechanics a nice cheap AC kit is a must. These are a direct fit/replacment for the Harbor Freight AC kit, as other have mentioned. They are way better then then ones that came stock and you don't have to buy a new kit.New ends in case old ones on the table.

I got this pair of NiLight LED lights for free from NiLight during a Facebook promotion contest, they are shown installed on my Jeep Wrangler in place of my 4.5 year old NiLight 18W cube for lights.The amount of light in the dispersion areas above and beside the Jeep is incredible now, but I will say that the down range beam lighting is not much different. That said, these are not driving lights with a pencil beam, these are fog lights with a desperation beam.Overall, they are what you expect from NiLight, a high quality aluminum housing, properly sealed to prevent ingress of moisture, and cheaply made yet functional mounting brackets.Based on my experience, I fully expect years of faithful service from any NiLight product. They seem to be about the most dependable blend of high performance, durable build quality and low cost. Sure, you can spend 80% more to get 20% more performance, but I'm not seeing the need for that unless your running Baja or racing nights at the Easter Jeep event. For us normal folk, saving the 80% in money is more than worth giving up the 20% in lighting performance and durability.

One of those things you buy and hope you never have to use. This is a well built, and nicely designed emergency escape tool, which I have placed in all my cars and plan on buying more as gifts for family and friends. Easy to install, and not obtrusive like other emergency tools on the market. Very pleased and like I said, hopefully I will never have to use it.Oh in regards to some of the 2 star ratings and negative feedback, this tool is not intended for diving, nor is it advertised for such. As a diver you should know, there's over 150 grades of stainless steel. Gear that will be exposed to extreme (salt) water generally use the most corrosion resistant version (very high chromium content) of stainless steel. Due to the nature of this tool and its intended use, it wouldn't make economical sense to use such a high grade and costly version of stainless steel. If they did, I'm almost certain they could not be able to offer it as such an affordable price. So if you used this tool underwater, specially in salt water and it rusted, it's not the manufacturers or items fault, but your own for assuming you could.This device is also not intended to cut glass, but aid in breaking it. Cutting glass vs breaking it requires two different approaches and the material used to do so is also quite different. If you want to cut glass, buy a glass cutter.If you use this device for cutting other material, such as wires, cables, ties, etc, you can and will most likely damage the blade portion of the tool. Once again, this is not intended for such use, so if you use it for anything other than what it is being advertised for, don't be shocked if you ruin the tool.It's some what comical how many of the negative or 1 star reviews are all from those who used this tool in a manor it was not intended to be. Then as if they have been duped, leave an unjust review. This is a tool that essentially should only be used in an emergency. It has two very specific purposes, and using it in an environment or manor it was not designed to be, can damage and or make this device ineffective.

Have owned and used this charger in light to moderate usage.Have helped out stranded people with their cars several times.Used it during a storm for a battery backup.The light comes in handy not found on newer style units.Just make sure to keep it charged if you plan on keeping it in yourcar or truck.  I paid less than they go for now but it was on sale and that wassix years ago.  For the price you could get two for what those mini things go for.Your choice.  Your $.  If you use this one time it will pay for itself not to mentionthe hassle factor, that mean more to me.I don't keep the light on when charging just wanted to show it working o.k.for demonstration purposes.  Good luck on all your battery chargingand shopping experiences.

These jump packs have certainly came in handy over the last year. I have about 4 of them and I have got to use 3 of them already. I was pretty skeptical about these when I got m first one thinking " how is this little pack going to jump my car" Well let me tell you this...they will. I have jumped my lawn mower, my Gator my Tahoe and most impressively I have jumped our RV. and its a F450. Most of these tell you they can jump a v6 or smaller...these can jump a v8 with no issues. Yesterday I had my tahoe at the store..came out and my truck as having a hard time starting..not sure why...but I ran the battery dead trying..Got this out and hooked it up. I had nice cramping amps again and after a few minutes I got my tahoe started. It went from 68% to 4% after about 6 tries. So....it worked. When I got back I started going through the rest of the kit while I waited on the battery to be charged. The multi tool that is provided is pretty nice although the batteries were dead in it. I opened it and seen it took small watch batteries and quite a few...around 5 I believe. I was not impressed with that. This could easily accommodate a AAA battery. So now I have to buy a large pack of watch batteries if I want to use this. It does have a "swiss army" style kit on the back...screwdriver knife etc...a window breaker, and of course a light and tire pressure meter. Those do not work because of he dead batteries. I hooked up the tire pump and it came on...Hooked it to my Ford Fusions tire because it was 2 pounds low...took awhile to pump  pounds in but it got the job done.4 stars on this pack because of the dead battery issue ...its brand new and I shouldn't have to run to the store to buy watch batteries on a new item. Better quality control there on an expensive item would be great. And the fact that it takes watch batteries...odd. Everything else worked flawlessly . So a high 4 stars...5 on the battery pack and tire pump. I aslo like the digital read out on the battery itself. So you know exactly how much juice you have. For the price this is a decent little kit to keep in your automobile and these jump packs are way easier than busting a large jumper box or trying to find someone to give you a jump through cables. Hook it up and start your car. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!! I received a sample product to test and evaluate and give my unbiased feedback to you. If anything changes during my usage, I will update my review

I use this bag a lot when I ride. It probably has more miles on it then most cars. With that being said, this is perfect for someone who needs a bag for short commutes or everyday riding. However, if you're on your bike almost everyday and you ride for long periods of time, this bag may not be a good option. It started splitting at the seams around one of the shoulder straps about a month or so in. I had a seamstress repair it. About a month ago or so later, the strap was doing the same thing. Overall, it is a great bag for the price, but be weary of overpacking it & make sure you always pick it up by the handle, not the straps so you can increase the longevity of the bag.

For whatever reason, Chrysler made PT cruisers with inner tie rods that have no indentations in them for the use of any kind of tool. This tool was recommended on the PT Cruiser forums for performing this repair. I got exactly what I needed: A flawless execution of inner tie rod removal. Forgot those big boxes loaded with a million different adapters for a million different cars. All you need is this one, right here! The price is SUPER reasonable too.

Added this to my pontoon cantilever lift. Works perfect. Not sure on pontoon weight, but guessing its 2500lbs. It grunts a little at 20-30 degress, most likely from my worn out sheaves. Wireless remote is great. Pontoon is in the water by the time I get to it. Would not suggest on verticle lift because the weight is always on the winch unlike the cantilever where the weight gets transferred to the lift pivot points. I usually leave the carrige supports at 80 degress.

Nice backup lights. Brighter than expected for their size. Be realistic about the light you'll get from 2 little led lights and you'll be happy.  They are noticable during the day and provide enough light at night to back up and see whats behind you. Very low profile and compliments the recessed 4" STT lights.

I am a big fan of led lighting, and particularly retrofit applications. What I have not often seen is a LED bulb that looks and feels almost identical to the conventional spotlights. They either have fins on the side, or make funny noises, etc... The Elko, a 100 w equivalent dimmable bulb is almost a perfect replacement to a conventional bulb, and in some ways is even better than the original.  Best of all, it is bright, and it is NOT HOT which cuts down on convective heat loss through the cans.Pros:The bulb, even down to the packaging, are like if Apple built a light bulb. The bulb itself feels stylish and solid, with good weight and solid construction. The packaging is also simple, recyclable, easy to open, and even stylish too. Given the cost of the bulb, it feels like you are getting the value you are paying for in terms of construction and presentation.The light quality from the bulb is excellent, to the point that it was difficult to distinguish from the conventional bulbs. If you look at the pictures, you can see that they are difficult to tell apart at full brightness (the middle one is the Elko).No humming, flaring, flashing, and they turned on almost instantaneously with only the slightest hesitation. When they are turned on, they are fully bright with no ramp up.Cons:Not even sure if you can call it a con, but dimming the bulb down on a non high tech dimmer got the bulb light low, but not as low as the conventional bulbs. Felt like the bulb brightness was maybe at 15% at its lowest before turning off. So, if you are going to switch out a set of bulbs in a room, I would do all of them so that they are not dimming at different brightness.In short, the Elko dimmable bulbs are a very high quality replacement for those conventional can bulbs with excellent light rendering and energy use and very low heat which will help with heat loss through the cans.  A perfect and bright can replacement bulb.I was fortunate to receive these as a sample for my honest review.

The CoolReall Smart Box21 is a multifunction, top notch product that has been carefully designed with safety in mind and below youll see why it gets an A+.PACKAGING// CoolReall does a great job on packing the item, thus making sure it doesn't damaged in the shipping process.  The presentation is simple, yet clean and once opened you're presented with a high-quality hard shell carrying pouch that contains everything needed, from the product to a plethora amount of cables and the instruction manual.DESIGN/USAGE// The Smart Box21 was designed for safety in mind, because it not only successfully can jump start your car in emergency situations, but also charge any micro USB cable device, 30-pin or any current Apple device using the provide lightning cable.  The cables are thick and don't feel like theyll break when using over time.  I charged my iPhone 6 Plus with no issues and still had plenty of juice left on the device.  Also, I tested it on my 2013 sports car and it had no issues and worked 100%.  Regarding the cables, wow!  CoolReall provides the jumper cable, smartphone charge cables, car cigarette lighter adapter and much, much more.  They really supplied everything youll need.Once turned on, the Smart Box21 has a handful of options, such volt settings to a LED light on the front of the device, plus a very bright set of white LED lights on the side and a strobe light function as well.  The lights are extremely bright and easily light up a small room and provide plenty of light under the hood or in other situations, if needed.FINAL IMPRESSIONS// I've been using the Smart Box21 for a while now and its simply amazing, as I plan on carrying it around in my backpack and in my car 24/7.  In my opinion, the device gives you piece of mind for your car and smartphone, as itd make the perfect travel companion on long road trips.  To date, I haven't had any issues with the product and its worked stellar!  I highly recommend the Smart Box21!!  I hope CoolReall continues to make awesome products with their customers in mind.

I've got this mounted where the OEM headlights use to be on my tractor. They are an upgrade over the factory lights, however it are not nearly as bright as some of the other light bars that I have used in the past. Bottom line if you need some additional lighting and are on a budget or don't want to spend a lot $$ for one that might get damaged this will do the job.

This is a very good inverter for the price. I bought it to start a 7sq' modified chest freezer I have on solar system but it did not have the transient power to start the compressor, Then I bought the next model the Prowatt 1000 and it can do the job without a blink. If you can spend some extra money go for the 1000 watts. It is worth it as you can run more and larger equipment. The sine AC wave output is not perfectly clean and I estimate the harmonic distortion are about +5% but it is good enough to run everything very efficiently and very quiet. I like very much how the internal fan is controlled as it is super quiet and runs at various speeds depending on the load or temperature. I'm attaching a pic on the AC wave form so you can see it.

I bought these months ago but I had not installed them until last week. Now with summer over the sun will be setting early so I wanted to increase my visibility.  I have to say this is probably the best visibility enhancer that 33 bucks can buy.  Look at my pics man. They were s*** with an iPhone 6s. One with flash off and one with it on.  After I shot the one with the flash I just had to get the other side too.  Interesting point too, is that if you compare the rim tapes with the yellow and red stock reflectors you can easily tell that the tapes are far more reflective than the stock round reflectors.Installing them was such a piece of cake too. I thought it would be a major headache but it turned out to be super easy.  I followed the directions completely and they look great and show no signs of peeling even though temps here have reached nearly 100 degrees lately.Now I feel I'm easier to spot on the road when I get out of work and it's like night time at 5:00 pm.  Best added protection 33 bucks will get a biker!

Works for my Jeep Wrangler on a quadratec class II hitch. Liked that I didn't have to drill into my frame. Like another reviewer, I had to tighten my bolts more in order to have it secure. This caused a very slight bend but it doesn't compromise the mount at all.** update 10/19/17 **Held up well until I went trail riding and bent the electrical connection side. The frame held up well for being bent upwards, but my plastic 7 way did not. Decided to replace it with a new one for aesthetics.

I also have used it to charge dead car batteries (in a pinch). I ordered this Battery Maintainer for a motorcycle which I charge between uses as well as during winter storage.Compared to the Battery Tender Junior, this unit has twice the capacity (1.5 Amp vs. 0.75 Amp), which is likely overkill for charging a motorcycle battery but great for decreasing charge times when used on trolling motor batteries, or other batteries that get drained down in use and require actual charging (as opposed to maintenance charging). This Stanley Battery Maintainer has a standard two prong plug, which is much easier to use than the "brick" design of the Battery Tender Junior (I've broken them when the "brick" hits the ground after being yanked off the wall). There are two things of the Battery Tender Junior that I prefer over this Stanley unit:  1) Noise - the Stanley unit makes clicking noises when it charges, and I've never noticed noise from the Battery Tender Junior  2) Status - the Battery Tender Junior has an LED (Green or Red) which does various things to show the status, and there is a key on the top which shows what the various things mean (flashing, vs. solid, etc.). The Stanley Battery Maintainer has two different LEDs, but you need to refer to the manual to know what they mean.

The clip is very much smaller than I had anticipated.  Truly it is tiny.  Other reviewers had mentioned that it was small, but didn't really have anything to compare it to so I am including a couple of pictures to try to illustrate how small it really is.  The description lists it at 4 inches by 1.9 inches which is not even remotely correct.Very disappointed.

They look great! They will do the job. But the mirror itself shakes alot. The housing doesn't move, it's the way the mirrors are attached inside the housing. The shipping kept getting delayed dispite shipping the day I ordered  them. If I were to do it again, I'd order the more expensive ones that are prime shipping, and hope they would be less shaky.

This is an excellent replacement battery set for a variety of brands and models of UPS systems - not just the APC UPS listed.  Purchasing a two-battery set is also more economical due to the fact these batteries sell for $18-$20 individually, and the two-battery set comes with free shipping.  Moreover, these batteries can also be used to replace most 1270 series batteries (12V 7Ah), resulting in an increased backup capacity of around 12-15% (depending on the number of batteries in your UPS).If you are buying replacement batteries strictly based on your UPS model number - you need to verify what your specific batteries are rated at before ordering batteries because some of the APC models listed as "RS 1500" use 9Ah batteries and some use 8Ah batteries.  This is an 8Ah replacement battery, and will not last very long if used where a 9Ah battery is required.My specific application replaced 6 model BB BP7-12 batteries in my Tripp Lite SU2200XL Double-online conversion UPS.  This is an older Tripp Lite model design I purchased in early 2006 (that I use in part to protect my home entertainment center).  The batteries I replaced were the original ones - which lasted well beyond expectations.  In fact, only two of the batteries were bad - but it's important to replace all the batteries at the same time (unless it was a premature failure), especially with how old the batteries were in my UPS.On a side note - I you're wondering what a double-online conversion UPS is - it's a UPS that converts incoming AC to DC power, and then uses a high quality, pure sine wave inverter to create clean AC power.  This completely isolates your equipment from the line AC and means there is zero transfer time due to the fact your supported equipment are always being powered by the UPS.  This piece of equipment has worked flawlessly and has (in concert with a series mode surge protector) completely protected my sensitive and expensive home entertainment system from the inevitable surges from thunderstorms here in Florida.  They are expensive - but well worth the investment - especially when you can get reasonably priced, quality replacement batteries such as these.These batteries came with the larger F2 terminal, and were exactly the same size as the BP7-12 batteries they replaced (please see the photo I provided).  I hope this review and the information provided helps you in your search and product selection.

This blade does not fit to the rear wiper of my '11 Chevy Equinox.  The Chevy blade is taller off the glass when this AutoTex is closer to glass.  As a result, the thick plastic wiper arm fairing drags on rear glass because AutoTex blade does not lift the fairing enough.  I returned it.

These are great quality and I would definitely recommend. Install took about 3 hours total and went pretty smoothly. I would suggest having a buddy help out to make it go quicker. Looks great on my 2007 Lincoln Mark LT. Instructions are not that good, so do yourself a favor and watch YouTube video before starting.

1st Gen 2002 Toyota TacomaI bought the red and white led style. i was hesitant to drop $200+ so i  waited for the price to drop and pulled the trigger. These lights work good, not great. A little dim tbh. Product came packed very nicely and secure. The only bulbs you have to buy are the reverse. You can reuse your stock reverse or buy a 1156 LED reverse bulb.

Its okay I just wanted frame for my car but for the price is a bit much for this frame. Pro its heavy and the 'stones' look like they will last. The cons are its actually bigger then the plate and there is no tab to rest the plate on to screw in to the bumper and you might need help. There is no holes on the bottom like in the picture the site used. Mine didn't and also I don't have bottom screw holes.

Not so waterproof. If the temperature is near 32 degrees you will face the embarrassment like what I faced. And if your hood is made of aluminum don't buy it. The wind will blow it.

Great product, love the feel. Giving 4 stars because the color (sand) doesn't match Fords Sand pigment. Hopefully it will darken with use ( it's a truck), if not oh well- still a great feeling product. It took me 2 and a half hours to install, shouldn't have decided to tackle this on a 90 degree day.

PIC ADDED .... So I just got them installed and I gotta say it makes the wheels look SOOOO Much Better!!! I know there is zero purpose in there other than looks but to many guys though we know our bikes are a tool we like our tools to look good and not like a dump of a dirt bike!Install was fairly easy ... Just gotta use a large pair or scissors or trimmer tools to cut and once you have one you can use that as a template to cut the others (until you move to a different section of spokes then remeasure again as they are not all the same).Once cut to correct length I just pulled back one end (the end that goes towards the inner hub) to get it to slide onto the spoke, then slide it down towards the hub and it pops right on. Be sure to make you cut end the side towards the inner hub and the fresh uncut end be towards the wheel itself for a cleaner flusher look at the wheel spoke end.The spokes in spots are tight so it's a little tough to get em on the spoke in between each other but not to bad. The front rim is easier and the spokes have a bit more give so start there first and then finish on the back tire.I have not taken the bike out so I don't know how well they will hold up ... if they are bad and damage easy or fall off I will be sure to come back and update my review (if you do not see an update all has gone great). They do scratch easy that's for sure ... I can just run a nail down the plastic and see a deep scratch so I hope they don;t look horrible after a few major dessert and rock rides.I also to a pic of the front rim on my 2006 KTM 450 EXC to show it looks with black on a regular aluminum colored rim! I wanted to some day get black rims but with this add-on I really think I am good now and kinda like the black tire, orange rim trim on the aluminum look with all black spokes now!!! :)They come in a nice bag all rubber banded up with a Bykas sticker to add to the sticker collection on the tool box.I would have liked to have seen more then only 1 extra spoke warp per size .... I ended up having to use a shorter cut spoke wrap cause I totally messed one up and then cut one a bit short ... so I had to use the short one unfortunately. If nothing else make it a couple 3 or so extras if possible for those new guys making mistakes more then once having never done this before.For the price they are great for sure and add a Killer look to a bland looking rim overall.I would recommend them to anyone wanting to spruce up the look of their bike! Thanks Bykas.

A nice add-on for controlling driving/fog lights, etc.  Mounted pretty easily and color match is close, but not perfect.  Now for the challenges: The inside edge (where it meets the windshield) was warped in - I overcame this by rolling up some paper towel and filling the inside/upper cavity, then running some screws to join the pillar and factory pieces together.  The other challenge is that the warp also makes the pillar move an 1/8" when closing the door - it's a Jeep so I'm used to "living with it".  All-in-all a worthwhile $20 investment.  I'd buy it again.

Don't use this to fully correct a paint job. But by all means use this as an All-In-One, because that is exactly what it is.This stuff is chock full of fillers, and I mean loaded. It's correction ability is going to be solely based on what pad you use to apply. It won't quite correct in the same fashion, but really leaves a beautiful finished product.I've used this on a few customers that don't want to pay for a one-step correction job, but still want the paint to be worked out so it's shiny and presentable. Expect to re-polish several months down the road when the fillers wear off.The protection ability of this isn't superior to your basic wax. I highly recommend topping this with a durable product such as Collinite or HD Poxy - the sister sealant to HD SPEED.I suspect if it's ever back in stock, it won't last long. Get it while the gettin's good - and pray that this product doesn't get discontinued for some reason.I used an orange pad to correct the scuffing on the fender of this Challenger (see pics). One pass. Then followed the entire fender and a portion of the door with a white pad at medium speed light pressure. Check out that clarity! Not a 100% correction, but easily 90% in the areas I hit with the orange pad first.

Really easy install even with aftermarket bumper already installed. The crossbar hides itself completely up between the frame rails and adds rigidity there. The hitch sticks out just enough to do the job. Great deal, tows great and does not kill a ton of departure angle.

This is an extremely easy battery tester to use for 6 & 12 volt batteries.  It tests volts and CCA with ease.Right off, one of the differences I noticed in this and other battery testers is that this one uses a 9 volt battery to start the testing process off.  Everything about this particular tester makes it easy to use - except for that 9 volt battery, which is behind a screw compartment.  It is easy to access with a regular Phillips screwdriver.The leads have the wires well covered and insulated.  This is one clue to the quality of this tester- the wires have a nice thick black insulating coating on them, compared to cheaper brands that have exposed, cheap wires.The manual is VERY well written and EASY.  I think almost anyone could understand it.  Also the device itself WALKS the user through the process of testing the battery, and the read out interprets ITSELF.The unit is easy enough for a home user with no specific mechanical training or aptitude, but it has features that make it very nice for a repair shop too.  There's 2 options that can be used for printing the results out -1.  Buy the optional thermal printer  that works via infrared- you BEAM the results to the printer PR 12 printer&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Auto-Meter-PR-12-Infrared-External-Printer/dp/B00DY4Z51I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Auto Meter PR-12 Infrared External Printer</a>2. Buy the optional cable that hooks it up from the little port to a serial cable and use a PC based printer. The battery does NOT have to be removed to use it. It asks the temp of the battery during testing for more accurate results. It is VERY simple to use.  The leads are CLEARLY marked, and it will flash if they aren't in good contact or on wrong.It has a black case that offers a good grip and that should protect it from a lot from greasy hands on the unit. This part can be removed and cleaned.The only thing I would have added is a hook - there's no hook. While this is fine for tool box use, my father owns an auto-repair shop and mechanics will be hanging this up by the cord over a hook, across a light- It won't be put in a tool box during the day and they'll want to hang it up.  A simple hook would have really been nice.  It DOES have a grill on the back and a hook could maybe be used out of a cable tie.  That was just a tiny little detail that, in my opinion, would have added durability for repair shops.Oh - also important to note- if you get the leads in the wrong place, it WILL TELL you.  It's really a user friendly, easy unit. The LED readout is VERY clear and easy to see.  It's much easier than the other ones I've seen.  It also works as a volt meter, and, it's a little thing, but there is a clear ON/OFF button that is ONLY used to turn it on and off.  There's a menu button- the controls are well thought out on this one.  The units where the on/off buttons double as something else are very annoying.  It stores 100 results in memory, and they are easy to access via the menu.Optional languages- English, Spanish, FrenchReads in MCU, CUs as well as CCUs (Some batteries will be marked MCU)Defaults to Fahrenheit, but has an option for CelsiusOther, less common options are offered as well, in a very easy to use set up menu.

Amazing difference in my 2011 f150 light output and just general style(not super noticeable) is much better than a factory halogen. This is a must have for dim lit areas or with vehicals with tinted windows. This also improved vision on reverse cameras at night as well. For the 2011 f150 it uses a 921 bulb

This works just as expected. Using it in a 5th wheel camper trailer. We have the dreaded parasitic draw somewhere in our RV so our battery is always dead the next time we want to go camping. This little switch fixed everything. Now we can disconnect the battery with just a flick of the key and there are no more dead batteries!  We keep a key attached to it with a zip tie and an extra in the RV just in case. WARNING there are NO instructions of any kind and you MUST purchase an additional battery cable in-order for this to work. This is my reason for giving it only a 4 star. It would have been nice to have some kind of diagram or something to give a bit of direction. However, I was easily able to find a how-to installation video online. Installation was as simple as unscrewing the wingnut on the battery, adding the extra battery cable and tightening all the nuts.  It only took a few minutes. Make sure and get a big enough battery cable to handle your battery. I originally bought one that was not rated high enough and was warned I would lose some amps so I returned it for a bigger one.Pros-inexpensive! much cheaper than replacing expensive deep cycle batteries all the time-easy to install-comes with 2 keysCons-comes with NO instructions of any kind!-not the best plastic but for the price it still works.

I cannot attest to the product function as of right now because I just put it into the vehicle but the product description was false.  It was supposed to be 16oz but I only got 14oz and to top it off the seal was broken on the bottle.  Then they placed another seal on top of the broken seal as if this would be a sufficient fix!  This is unacceptable and I will not purchase from here again.

My 1999 Lexus RX300 was getting CEL (P0125, P1030, P1033 & P1035).  Read the postings on ClubLexus and found Denso 234-9009 is perfect fit for Bank 1 Sensor 1 (behind firewall, access from underneath the vehicle).  Removing the connector is the biggest job.  Used a pickup tool with wire prongs to hold the sensor connector part from the top, pressed the tab on the right connector and disconnected relatively easily.  Jacked up the front passenger side, went underneath the vehicle and sprayed PB blaster penetrating oil on the old sensor threads, waited for a few minutes and was able to get it out easily using an O2 sensor removal tool.  Applied the anti-seize that came with the package on the new sensor threads and installed.  Total time spent was under 30 minutes!  Disconnected the battery negative terminal for a few minutes, then started the engine and the codes didn't come back!  Check out the pictures posted in the images section.This sensor works for Bank 1 Sensor 1 (before catalytic converter, access from underneath the vehicle) and Bank 2 Sensor 1 (between the engine and radiator, accessed from the top).Note: Recommend using two jack stands for added safety while working under the vehicle.PB Blaster:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Blaster-16-PB-Penetrating-Catalyst-11-oz/dp/B000I2079E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Blaster 16-PB Penetrating Catalyst - 11 oz.</a>O2 Sensor Tool:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Powerbuilt-648691-Oxygen-Sensor-Offset-Puller/dp/B00390BS7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Powerbuilt 648691 Oxygen Sensor Offset Puller</a>Update: February 16, 2014The Check Engine Light (CEL) is staying off and the mileage has improved.

Hella is the best. Have been purchasing Hella headlights, for all my vehicles, since 1986. The beam pattern on the road is perfect, with no hot spots or unlit areas. Installed this pair on our 1996 Fleetwood Flair RV, and viola you can now actually see the road.Note: I had just recently tried a pair of aftermarket projector headlamps, with LED halos, and its beam pattern was terrible. So don't waste your time on no-name quality headlights. Just buy the best.

purchased two of these for the rear stabilizer of my 2007 Ford ZX4 ST. The socket nut that comes with these link kits really eases installation as it allows a lot more play in the stabilizer bar after you've partially installed one. Just thread the first one on a few turns and then install the second one and then tighten them both up to the automobile manufacturers torque, 11 lb-ft for a Focus.The polyurethane bushings that come with these links helped reduce understeer of my '07 Ford ZX4 ST when compared to rubber bushings, but they are even quieter than the previous OEM bushings I had installed before these.I installed these without lifting the car. It took about 15 minutes. I'm using these in conjunction with a 22mm rear stabilizer bar. 1mm larger than stock may not sound like much, but it makes the car almost neutral in the curves, and allows easy trail-braking four-wheel drifts through turns.One link is in each box, so you have to order two for a bar.I will be using these any time a vehicle needs new end links, from now on.

I know this product is used by a lot of my competitors and it will eventually get the job done but that's just it. You wear out your pads waiting. Switched to the griot's garage corrective creams and polishes and could not believe with the right pad it did twice the work in half the time. Meguiars make some great products but in some cases there are better products available. I pay a little more for the Griot's polishes but they finish fast and last longer

Perfect fit. I received an old Dee Zee tool box for free that was missing the keys. I had to replace all the rivets anyways so I replaced the lock with the handle removed. It honestly looks like in would have been a pain to get to the bolt with it mounted on the box.Sadly the bedliner started peeling off my handle when I removed it. I need to touch it up a bit.

After 4.5 years I decided to put new LED fogs in my JK, and they have really made a difference.  I did have to cut the factory harness off and do some soldering, as well as remove the front bumper.  The included instructions are simple and very handy.  I did not use an anti-flicker harness and I have noticed no flickering.  The halo is very bright, so bright in fact it reflects off the center lenses, making them look less like a halo than the headlights made by the same company.Very happy with these lights thus far.

After living with these bulbs for a while, I can make a recommendation to the manufacturer to vastly improve them (9007 version).  The high beams have an unacceptable dark spot in the middle of the beam pattern on each bulb (each headlight).  When on high beams, all of the LEDS should be lit.  That would pretty much fix everything.  As they currently function, there is a set of 4 LEDs on each side of each bulb that is lit on low beam, and a different set of 4 LEDs on each side of each bulb that is lit on high beam.  The location of these LEDs along the length of the bulb, relative to the reflector housing they're going in and relative to the light shield on each side of each bulb, is what determines the light output / beam pattern.  And these factors are why the high beam pattern is so POOR !!!  The solution is to light all 16 LEDs per bulb (8 on each side) when on HIGH beam.  The low beam LEDs should continue to function as they currently do with the 8 total LEDs per bulb (4 on each side) lit on LOW.  Engineers should design the heat dissipation to allow this, and engineer the ballast accordingly.  This is specifically for the 9007 model.  Trust me, this would fix the issues for the 9007 bulb version.

I can see about twenty yards off the road on both sides and see way ahead of me on the road. It makes night into day. when I'm on a trail it makes it extremely bright.

Excellent tire repair kit.  I've done 4 repairs without any issues (riding mower and 3 on my Tahoe).  Procedure: Insert sticky strip into tool with the eyelet opening, add a little lube to both the strip and the tip of the tool.  remove nail/screw, bore/clean hole with tool spiral tool (do this several time to get the hole clean and big enough for the plug), stick the tool with the strip in until about 1/8" sticks out.  With one quick motion, pull it out.  Trim off the excess with a utility knife and you're done.  You can check for leaks by applying some soapy water.  I'm 4 for 4 so I'm confident this will work in a pinch.

Bought this for my Curt 13514 tow receiver.  It fits, but just barely.  Had to bend the screws outward and install them upside down due to not enough clearance between the receiver reinforcement and the chain anchors.

Kinda cheap looking . The thread is already unraveling on one of them and I have only owned these for less than a month. However, it does do the job its intended to do.

These rags performed better than I expected after I first saw them. They are very thin, yet they are surprisingly absorbent. I wouldn't necessarily say that one towel can be used to dry an entire car - you would be wringing it out a lot. They are very handy to use in the home and in the garage. They are woven tightly enough that they won't rip when using for tougher jobs.Note: I was able to purchase this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

First, I love these and am so glad I installed them. But... it did take almost 3 hours to get them on. It is a pain to get the old ones off and the new ones screwed back in. You have to remove the liners underneath the wheel wells, which is a lot more work than I expected, and you end up breaking the push clips and have to go through the hassle of finding new ones.But the end result is so very worth it. I will post a photo of my blue 2001 Wrangler with them on in the photos.

The Valterra Hi-Flo Stainless Steel Regulator was installed into the inlet side of our 40-gallon gas water heater - to prevent pressure fluctuation inside the glass tank that can cause the tank to crack and fail. Water Heaters have become VERY expensive to replace, and the Valterra Regulator is cheap insurance against tank failure. The lower water pressure saves money, too -- because it takes LESS ENERGY to heat water that is under lower pressure. UPDATE : 1 June, 2018. Still working perfectly. Holds pressure at 52-55 psi. Still NO leaks or drips.

This hose looks good but after installing it I still had a leak. When I tested for leaks using smoke I found that this hose had developed a large split in it as seen in my photo. I had to remove the intake manifold AGAIN! I will never buy Dorman products again. It's not worth the risk. I bought a Gates hose to replace this one and it has thicker sides and is made in Turkey instead of China. There have been no problems with the Gates hose.

I have used Dura Lube in my Camry since it's first oil change. I had some minor engine work done very recently (timing belt) when the mechanic came in to the waiting area just to ask me what I have been using in my engine. I told him that I really have only used Dura Lube. Why? I asked him. He told me that he had never seen an engine with so many miles on it that was so clean on the inside. It's the original engine by the way. I use Dura Lube every third oil change and have nothing but praise for the product. I will never own a car that doesn't have this stuff in the engine. My lawn man uses it in all of his lawnmowers as well.

I was impressed with the entire kit, instructions and results!  Set aside a Saturday...set your self for success and spend the 3-4 hours cleaning your calipers, especially if you have never cleaned them before.  With proper preparation, I was able to easily follow the application instructions and as you can see from the photo, the results are awesome!  I applied roughly 4-5 coats.  Take your time, there is plenty of paint in this kit, for multiple coats!  Many washes later, the results are still great!  Awesome product and highly recommended!

Package right fast and upon first inspection everything looked alright.  Upon opening the packages up and inspecting all the pieces,. I saw that the cylinder head itself was either poorly machine or was badly scratched.  Also 2  piston rings are badly warped.  This is not a finished review,. This is more intended for gofit to show pictures of what it is I'm talking about. Waiting for a response and resolution to the problem.

I need something to hold my extra long wrenches as they're all over the place in my tool box. Luckily for me my wrenches fits perfect will into this organizer and now my box is a bit more organized and with some more free room.The quality is pretty good.

I can't recommend these 1157 LED replacement bulbs enough! I received the bulbs in just a day after ordering, and the bulbs fit flawlessly in the 1157 socket. The power consumption is incredibly minimal but the brightness greatly exceeds the original incandescent 1157 bulbs. The first two attached photos show the comparison of the bulbs side-by-side, with the LED bulb on the left and the original incandescent on the right. Even with the lens cover reinstalled, its easy to see this bulb is much brighter! There is a slight difference in size, with the new LED bulb being slightly longer as shown in the third photo. This size difference didn't impact my installation as shown in the fifth photo. The final photo shows the contrast between the two filaments, in this case between the tail light and brake light functions on my 1987 Yamaha Maxim 700. I intend on replacing all of my vehicles' old bulbs with these!

Pros-very nice finish and price.Cons-Difficult to fit around Beta Xtrainer hydraulic lines on both sides.Very weak.I killed the engine doing a tiny bank climb in 3rd. Bike fell over from a dead stop into the soft dirt/grass covered bank and the guard cracked at the hinge point. Not even a scratch on the bar end surface it was so slow of a fall over.Simply not tough enough in my opinion. Save your money and buy a heavy duty set.

Wasn't sure if they would work or last, but so far so good. Really wasn't expecting much, I thought for the price it really wasn't a huge investment. So I used two for my bbq pit, was very impressed when I saw the housing was metal. It is a new pit so I had to season it, or just an excuse to cook on it lol. I have to say that they have been holding up to the temperature. Now I don't know how long they will last, but I'm comfortable with putting them in the smoker. And if they do go bad I will get more!!!They lasted a year in my BBQ pit!!!

Just Installed it on my Jeep. It look nice and durable. It fits my licence plate and fits in my frame no problem. their stock picture with the paper behind it is exactly like the one I received.Update: I would like to add that it's against the law in Michigan to have this license plate cover. I would recommend that make 100% sure that its legal in your state before buying. I got pulled over by a State Cop and received a fix it ticket for it. I now have a clear one (same brand) and it fits the same.

You know that old oil can that your grandfather had?  The one that sat on the old oil soaked shelf in the garage?  It was always covered in a layer of dirt and sawdust that had stuck to the film of oil that always seemed to be covering it?This is exactly like that.  There is no way to stop this can from slowly leaking oil all over itself, and whatever surface it sits on.

This is an exact replacement for the cabin filter in a 2011 Ford Fusion. I just bought the car, so I had no idea how long it had been since either the cabin or air intake filter were replaced.  After watching a tutorial on Youtube, I ordered this filter, along with an air filter--https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VKYRR6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The removal of the old and installation of the new are hampered by a metal cylindrical part that you need to maneuver the filter around; not impossible, but a little coaxing and finesse will be required.I have to say I wasn't ready for the amount of crud that I found trapped in the "old" filter!  There is obviously a need for the filter, and it certainly did its job to block dust and pollens.Again, not knowing how long it had been since this filter had been changed, I'm thinking the answer might be "this is the first time in six years".I'm going to check the condition of it in three months just to get a baseline for its performance, and for now the air inside the car smells much fresher!

I bought a cheapy $25 thermostat from Motorad when it came time to change my serpentine belt and water pump. Bad idea.One of the cheap plastic tabs on the side that holds the spring plate broke. Luckily it didn't try to escape and use my water pump as a blender, but it did impede the cars warm up time and caused it to throw intermittent cooling codes.So I hit up some forums and found the OEM part number, which led me to Amazon. It's more expensive sure, but the entire spring plate surface and tabs are made of metal. It's worth the extra cost to only have to do this once.You can see in the picture that the Motorad piece (top) is cheaply made and broke. The bottom piece (OEM) is worth the extra $, no question.

I love these lights. I used them as backup/reverse lights.  When I put the car in reverse, it's almost as bright as my headlights going forward.  I don't know why all cars don't have this bright of reverse lights.Obviously it depends on the car and the location of the lightbulb you are replacing, but I found this to be an easy replacement.  Getting to the bulb socket was a little tricky, but after that it was a piece of cake. I took the old bulb out and popped the new upgrade in.The light is really bright and the color of the light is really white.  Check out the picture to see the difference.  The old bulb is the yellow one.  The new one is the white one.I was given a discount on this set for agreeing to review the product.  I liked it so much I did the same upgrade on my other car.

The product is really great and very nice. High quality. The frame is plastic though I thought that the whole thing will be stainless steel that is why I am giving it 4 stars. the packaging was good and it came with all the instructions needed to remove the original grill and replace it with this one. It gave a different look to my truck.

Bought one for my 2 5/16" ball equipment trailer and one for my 2" ball snowmobile trailer.  This is quite a substantial lock - both the shank and the body are very heavy duty.  It comes with 4 keys.  Both locks unlocked and locked well and fit securely in the ball sockets.  They look like they will resist corrosion quite well.  I like the fact that both ends of the shank lock as some of the cheaper locks only lock one end.Also like the fact that they came via UPS in two days.  Usually it takes me over a week to get UPS shipments from the East Coast.My only bitch is that, because Amazon doesn't allow a comment on orders, I called the company and asked them to give me two locks with the same keys.  The secretary couldn't find my order but said that she would inform order fulfillment to do so.  That didn't happen.I don't believe anything will secure a trailer in your yard if someone is determined to take it.  This lock will keep someone form hooking it on a ball hitch.  I secured the safety chains with another padlock.  I also used a wire cable with another padlock to tie the trailer to my tractor.  I think these three measures will keep it from being stolen but then I do also have insurance.Yep, I know I have the shank on backwards in the pic.  I have since figured out that the top bend goes to the back:)Update 7/13/2017:  After 2 years I am replacing one of these locks because it jammed because of internal corrosion.  I see that they now put a rubber cap over the key entrance which should help.  Lesson here is that, if you are in a wet environment, you should spray some WD40 in these locks once in a while.  I hate spending $43 on a new one after only 2 years but still think it's the best lock for the money on the market.

Installation was easy once I got the old horns out, which had been dead for years and were rusted in place pretty badly.The instructions are very easy to follow. The Broncos factory horns had only one wire going to each, so I opted for installment type B (I also couldn't find a good spot to secure the ground wires, so I drilled a small hole into the frame of the truck and bolted them there). The stock power connectors even fit the new horns, so I ended up not having to cut them off and crimp on new connectors, as recommended in the instructions.My advice:  before you purchase any new connectors or snip any wires, check if your stock connectors fit the PIAA horns, because chances are that they do. Youll be saving yourself a step.Overall, these horns are fantastic, and it was a fun & easy project that took about an hour including drilling time. Theyre only slightly louder than a stock horn, but the tone is what makes them stand out.If you're looking for a horn that doesnt ask, but rather TELLS people to get out of your way, look no further.

I like the finish, and I like how my bike looks now, and I love how my bike feels and handles, it completely transform the feel of your bike, so it is not only the looks, but also the feel of the bike................ They are not hard to install and they fit like a golve, I had no issues at all. Just use soap water to get the grips in............. These do have dimples of the bottom of each side, a little track is used to help you run the controls wires and not damage them when you tight the lever clamps. Without the dimples it would be almost impossible to run those cables. But the dimples limits the different angles that you could try to find the best fit for your riding style and that is disappointing................ It is not the handle bars fault, it is Harley and they control design that makes no sense............. They have a nice thick gloss finish, but they will scratch with the clamps, so make sure your installation is final so you don't end up with scratches and marks everywhere............... They are perfect in length, just enough to fit all the controls, but they don't feel too wide or too short, they are just right in length.............. The only thing I don't like is that they do have too much pull back, so if you want to set them flat, the controls will hit the tank, so you either have to set them shooting up like a dirt bike, or set them shooting down like a sport/cafe racer bike. If I had to do it over, I would buy a more straight back............... You will have to do a lot of adjusting and fiddling with the clutch cable which ends up being too long, the turn signal cables, those are easy to handle, and the break line union tube which is bent by default but you will have to straighten it as much as possible without breaking it, it is some what of a soft metal so it is not hard to do............. Recommended, you will be amaze at the difference they make.

Item was packaged well and arrived quickly. Install was a breeze and fit was excellent for my crew cab Titan. I drove it on the freeway right after install and it was great! Only downside was it was missing the LED light that was promised as a free gift along with other goodies. I didn't really mind since the product itself surpassed my expectations.update 9/12/16:so far it's still holding up well. the little caps on the bars that keep it sturdy when laid out came loose, but nothing superglue can't fix.  the stitches on the velcro on one corner have come off/ripped off (about an inch).  it still seem to hold fine though.

Just received and installed, so I cannot speak to reliability.  That said, so far I LOVE these LED fog lights.  My Mazda CX-9 has the HID Xeon lights.  It's always bothered me that the fog lights are halogen.  The Mazda fog lights always look so orangy compared to the HID head lights.These lights are a very close match to the factory HID xeon head lights.  If anything, they are a whiter light.  I am enclosing several photos showing the difference.  Hope these help.  Original on left, Alla LED on right.

This paint for the calipers is the best on the market. I was able to have enough paint to do three coats on all four calipers. The paint has held up for three years. I had to order more paint because the repair shop chipped a good amout off installing my new rims. I live on the east coast where winters can be brutal on cars but the paint has held up under all conditions so this is why I recommend this paint.

I bought this for a Subaru Forester hitch because my cat cage took up so much room in the car.  I wanted something that didn't lower gas mileage which happened when I had a Yakima box on top.  This swings away quite nicely so you have access to the back of your car, and the box actually holds quite a bit of stuff.  I drove 17K miles this summer, got an average of 30.6 mpg through Alaska, Yukon, Canada, Montana, and west coast, on a lot of dirt roads, with no mishaps.  I did put on a hitch tightener and did not use the entire length of the taillight connector and bought longer tailpipes so the exhaust would not go straight back to the plastic box and melt it.  The box that goes with this kept out the wind, dust, and the heavy mud that I drove in.  I also like that it was unaffected by rocks and other natural elements that was thrown at it.  Everything inside stayed nice and dry.  This is super because it can be swung away from the back and then snugs up when driving.  It was perfect for my Alaska Adventure.

My car is getting older and the steering wheel is looking kind of funky.The rubber is kind of coming off of the steering wheel little by little so I thought it was time to get something to cover it and this silicone steering wheel cover seemed to fit the bill.Well it definitely didn't disappoint. The silicone is nice and soft to the touch but still has good texture printed onto it. It fit perfectly over my steering wheel and doesn't slide around at all. The silicone does a good job at gripping the wheel.Overall I'm really pleased with this really vibrant and fun steering wheel cover. It really added a nice pop of color to my otherwise bland and aging car.

Product is exactly what is says it is.  License plate mounting frame.  Volvo cars have an odd mount spacing for US plates, and need to use this device.  I like the concept but not the application.Bracket design is flawed.  One side is taller than the other, but a license plate is flat.  The picture is not exactly what I received - but the description matches perfectly.  I should have done a little more research, and can blame no one but myself.Installed 2001 Volvo S80.  Had to put in some spacers on the short side to lift the plate for a better fit ,  but not too much or the nuts would not have any threads to connect.  I cannot think of any US license plate that would fit this bracket without damage.This amazon item came with mounting nuts.  I painted the bracket and nuts black.

I was worried these would be too cheap to work well. I was wrong!They definitely needed some extra sealing work with some silicone, I could see large gaps along two edges on both lights. I made sure I was extra careful to seal these puppies up, and now have them installed on the back of my 2002 Dodge Dakota as additional reverse lights. They work amazing for this. For work I drive around a lot at night and frequently have to reverse long distances.These are bright! Work perfectly to help me see in reverse, and let other vehicles around me know Im backing up! I wired them directly into the reverse lights and they work great! No issues so far in the winter snow, we'll see how they hold up in the spring rain.The metal housing is very sturdy and well built, and it looks like these things would be top notch if not for the poor mounting of the lens and internal light structure. But I guess thats what you're paying for.Seal them up and they should be great for many years to come!

First off, let me start by saying that I have tried other , cheaper LED bulbs in my 2015 VW GTI. All of them threw error lights that would have required coding with VCDS to kill the light.These bulbs are BRIGHT. They replace the halogen bulbs I had in my tail lights and are as bright, if not brighter than the halogens. They can only be placed one of two ways in the harness so check fitment and test the lights before you put everything back together again.For the price, I would recommend these over significantly more expensive LED bulbs offered by some VW tuning sites.

This is a fantastic way to add extra support to your tube bumper. My 2016 Rockwood 2306 has the I-beam frame with the tube bumper. I had to grind a slot in the I-beam so the brackets would fit snugly and then drill six holes to attach the brackets. A little touch up paint and the job was done in less than an hour. This is an item that I am sure will work as described.

I absolutely love this stuff! It just came today, and I went nuts testing it on every different surface I could, and it's fantastic. This is my second Chemical Guys product, and I am definitely going to continue buying their products!I used a foam applicator to try it on my tires, and it left a nice satin shine with one coat. I put on another coat and it brought up the shine a bit more. It's not going to give you an extreme shine (like DUB Tire Shine, for example) with just one or two coats, but it does provide a really good shine. On my tan Volvo dashboard, it looks great, and gives a really nice shine that is a bit more than my Meguiar's Natural Shine Protectant. It didn't work much better than any other product on faded gray Volvo trim, but I only tried it on my worn out roof rails, so I haven't gone any further to tell you more.It also has a very nice cherry scent, much like a generic bank lollipop, for lack of a better comparison. It's not like a cough syrup, like some people have said about Chemical Guys Maxi-Suds II. Plus it really is dry to the touch. Another great quality in a dressing!I haven't gotten the chance to try it on leather, because I am very careful about what I use on my leather. I might give it a shot soon.You can see the comparison in the picture of the dash. Left is dry after applying the Meguiar's around two weeks ago, and right is New Car Shine Dressing after about 2 minutes.I highly recommend this dressing for all of its suggested uses!

See pic on my rxv. Why could they not have included such a method?Beware: they suggest  7/64 drill bit as a pilot hole. No way for a human to not strip the Phillips head screws tapping their way thru a 7/64 hole. 1/8 is still a struggle.Last, why could they not tell you there is an upside down? I first installed mine wrong side up. That way plays with your head.

Bought this thing over a year and finally got around to installing it on my truck. Very simple design so wiring was not problem at and the LED strip that it came with was surprisingly brighter than I expected. If you don't want to use the push pin provided you could even run your own toggle switch which I might do on my Accord. But overall great purchase this will come in handy one day when I am on the side of the right and need light and its also looks amazing.

Purchased this for my dad so that he could pull some large tree pieces around the field behind his Tundra. He didn't have an after market bumper with tow points, but did have a 2" receiver. This fit perfectly in the receiver and attached with a standard hitch pin.We were able to pull several large (1ft diameter, 4ft long) logs around a field with no issue. The final task was to pull down a 30" diameter tree trunk, about 15ft long, down and then across the field to the burn pile. The product worked well for this task and had no visible damage after use. I've also seen people use this to pull people out of trouble spots multiple times while recreationally off-roading. It has always held up, and its solid base is very inspiring (most others on the market are hollow). I think we purchased a quality product that will stand up to years of abuse on the farm. Thanks Smittybilt!

This is a wonderful liquid wax that provides protection for your car and water beading properties (think Rain-X, but for your paint). When applying the wax I normally do roughly a panel at a time (or for large panels like the hood I do half at a time), let it sit for about 2 minutes, and then wipe off with the included towel. It is strongly suggested to wax your car after washing and then using a clay kit. I have tried the Meguiar's clay kit, but I prefer the one from Mothers as I have gotten better results from it&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mothers-07240-California-Gold-Clay-Bar-System/dp/B0002U2V1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar System</a>.

I used these as dash lights in my 91 YJ, they look great, but they are not dim-able which is why I only gave them 4 stars. If they had been any color other than red, they would have been too bright.

6/3/2017 UpdateMy passenger side ballast (which I got a replacement from Kensun after contacting them) appears to have a faulty igniter. Sometimes it does not turn on. My original passenger ballast never had a problem igniting the bulb, but had trouble maintaining stable luminosity--now the replacement ballast I received has trouble igniting. As a result of this I cannot recommend this product due to this common trend of unreliability from Kensun's hardware.Original Review:Works for me, but your mileage may vary--do note that this is a very cheap HID kit so do not be surprised if they aren't on par with kits 2-4 times the price of this kit. For me, the HID kit costs roughly the same amount as a pair of Diamond Vision H11 halogen bulbs, but provides better nighttime visibility and has a longer life span. The warm up time of this kit is however somewhat long (maybe half a minute).When I first had these installed, I was very disappointed because the light appear somewhat greenish, however after using them for about two weeks, they now appear white with a bluish tint (this might've also been because I'm impatient and didn't wait for the kit to warm up before judging it upon initial installation). One of my ballasts was bad as well (it had intermittent variation in brightness where the luminosity would vary--not completely turning on and off causing a flicker but it resulted in a sort of 'dancing' or 'flowing' effect).In contrast to some other buyers on Amazon--I did not have to return my Kensun kit to Amazon for a replacement. I contacted Kensun directly on their website indicating my Amazon order number, answered a few simple questions about my car and within two days, I had a replacement ballast in the mail free of charge. I hooked it up and now my headlights are working as expected. I did notice something strange, however, my replacement ballast was substantially larger than the ballast from the Kit I received from Amazon as noted in my pictures. Both the stickers list the exact same specifications and model name.I installed this kit to get rid of my halogen bulbs on my 2016 Veloster Turbo.Unfortunately, the installation of HIDs on the Veloster Turbo is not plug and play and you will have to do quite a bit of work to install them. In my opinion, this is a weekend project.In order to get these to work on my 2016 VT, I had to purchase (quite a few) addition things:-3M automotive tape (used these secure the ballasts)-1 inch drill bit (to drill holes on the headlight dust caps); also need a drill if you don't have one-Torque/Ratchet Wrench Set (you will have to take off your bumper unfortunately, and for taking out the headlights)-Kensun HID Kit Relay Harness (the H11b connection from the headlight itself doesn't provide enough power to drive the ballasts directly).-HID Warning Cancellor (I got mine from Diode Dynamics, basically its a wiring harness with a capacitor)  Unfortunately, the VT low beams utilizes pulse width modulation--which is basically a method of controlling power output by rapidly switching the signal on and off (oversimplified). PWM causes the relay to have an annoying buzzing noise.In order to connect the H11 Kit to the H11b connection (the low beam H11b connection in the VT is physically incompatible with H11)  I also bought:- Female H11 Adapter Wiring Harness- Spade Connectors (to crimp to the ends of the H11 harness in order to to connect to the H11b connector)- Shrink wrap or Electrical Tape (I used the later)Also do note that at stock. the physical bulb socket H11b in the VT low beam headlight doesn't allow securing the bulb at the correct orientation. The bar of the bulb should be pointing downwards. In order to achieve this, I had to unscrew the 3 screws on the socket and rotate it.On a side note, please only install HID kits in headlights with projector housings.

Very nice bag, that helps organize and hold particular pieces of recovery gear.  This large bag is the same as the ARB gear bag that ships with their bigger recovery kit.  That kit is set up for jeeps and off road SUV's !  I have a full size 4x4 diesel pickup, that weighs 8,000 lbs(17,500 lb. winch installed), as shown in the photo.  As such the straps i carry are bigger and rated in the 30,000 lb. plus category.  Therefore i cannot fit 3 full size straps. I can fit 2-30,000 lb. straps(30 ft)., a 30,000 lb. tree/bridle strap (8 ft.),and a winch dampener, in the main bag.  I also can fit 1--7/8th inch D-ring and gloves in 1 end pocket. and 2--3/4 inch shackles(D-ring) in the other.  The bag at this point has become as heavy as you want to carry.As the Item picture shows, there is a set of interior gear flaps which allow you to cover the top of your gear. Over this is a retaining buckle which holds everything in place. Finally over all this is a double buckle for the bags lid flap.  Others have mentioned how well this is designed, and i concur.  ARB came thru with this item. As a final thought, ARB's new equipment bags and cases, now come with topographical lines over the orange.  On some websites you will notice that some of these bags are only orange.  These are NOS (new old stock).  In other words last generation gear.

Fits my 2007 Suzuki Boulevard C50T perfectly.  Need the xxxl due to having the windshield and large saddle bags and the passenger back rest with luggage rack. Only con I see is your bike has to be completely cooled off due to no heat shield resisting liner. Other then that i see it provide good protection.

After building a custom yak trailer, buying enough J-racks to carry 6 yaks so the whole family can go at once, I found myself looking for a way to haul my "baby"- a 16' Wilderness Systems tandem modified into a one-man clamming/fishing/cruising rig that was born at 80 lb. and now weighs probably another 6 with the mods.  It's way lighter than my 130 lb Scanoe, but growing older means growing tired of tossing that sucker up onto the roof of my highlander, which puts it pretty darn high off the ground.  Time for yet another option!The difference between the J-rack and the saddles was key, since the saddles will allow a simple sliding maneuver from the rear of the truck, no actual lifting required.  Simply bring the yak to the rear end, toss one end up and onto the rear saddle, then slide it into place. Yeah, I can deal with that!Days of research led to these saddles,  which seemed the best compromise between cost quality and effectiveness. Had there been a better clamping system that fits factory (wide, airplane wing shaped) bars I would consider paying more, but for some reason most of the folks who offer these rack systems think we're all related to the Vanderbilts.  While it's true- I am secretly Bill Gate's rich uncle, I still think we should be able to buy a kayaking rack for less than half a month's pay.  But, I digress...I'm posting this review to offer some insight into what I think others might be wondering about these saddles, much as I had.  Many product descriptions are vague, while others range from simply incomplete to outright deceiving.  (There are sites which offer a "set" of saddles for over $100, only to find once you buy them that you need a SECOND pair to actually be able to load anything!)Whatever they may advertise, a setup is only effective if it works in YOUR particular situation- and there's certainly no one-size-fits-all when it comes to supporting the millions of hull designs out there.This set will work well for mine because it has a wider, flatter bottom than some.  Seeing that these saddles are non-adjustable that's an important consideration because a rig with more acute (steeper) sides is not going to sit as comfortably.  I'm not saying they won't work, it's just that you might find a better shape to fit a steeper hull.Also, you can see in the description that there's a little ridge along the outside edge of each saddle.  It is indeed stiff, not soft and pliable.  Of course it is plastic so there's some give, but I did read of a buyer who noticed it digging into his hull slightly in the heat.Oh, and those ribs you see creating those oval shadows- that's a thin pad of material that's meant to help grip the hull during transport.  Nice during transport, not so nice when you're trying to slide a yak onto the saddle.  Again, it's not all that bad, but I did a quick test by simply sliding a saddle along the hull of my rig, and immediately decided to carry out a mod I had been considering all along: 10 minutes later two of the saddles are now lined with thin outdoor carpet runner. Mounted at the rear of the truck, the yak will glide right along until it hits the more "sticky" pair up front and stops where I want it.  Of course setting the proper distance apart sideways for each set will ensure the yak is snug and happy once strapped down.  A can of 3M spray glue was all I used; it will allow quick replacement of the padding when the time comes, as well as not altering the saddles themselves.  I'm including a pic of the modified saddles for anyone interested.As others have noted, the threaded brackets were a hair wide and wouldn't fit into the holes on the saddles, but a couple light taps with a soft-face hammer fixed that, it's really just a minor inconvenience. One could even smack them into shape with a block of wood if need be. Although they are not the most sophisticated clamps I now own, they do tighten up very strongly on my factory racks; one thing I'll likely do is switch to stainless washers and lock nuts in place of the supplied knobs.  There's nothing wrong with the knobs, I just don't like the fact it's way too convenient for some lowlife to help himself to the saddles while I'm off fishing somewhere.  While pretty much everyone carries a left and right hand with them, not everyone will be carrying along a set of tools that'll loosen the hardware I'll be using.  Sure it can be done, but each nut will take so long to unscrew I doubt they'll dare hang around long enough to do it 16 times!I can already tell just from messing with these saddles that they're going to serve me well, and I'm happy to be adding yet another option to take advantage of being surrounded by water.  I think they'll do the same for a lot of other folks as well, as long as you're working with flatter hull designs rather than steep ones.  I hope the rant I provided helps you in some small way while you decide.  Yak on!

If you plan on using this item, use item per manufacturer's recommendation, you will be glad with the outcome. I have been detailing now for 2 years and I have come across plenty of items claiming to give cars wet look, but not a bunch of them actually are able to fulfill that claim.  Blackfire on the other hand has and I was so excited using it the first time and every time since then. This is because it does provide what it claims. The only con to it is, durability and prep time for set vehicles. Meaning,Washing carDetailing clay bar: to remove excess dirt particles.compound: when necessary, depending on the car paint condition.Swirl Remover or paint cleaner: when necessary, depending on the car paint condition.Finishing polish: provided that necessary, depending on the car paint condition.Glaze: to hide car paint imperfection.Blackfire wet diamond or Carnauba Wax.Spray wax: The best one I use is zymol field glaze the 8 oz pump, works great'Must also have plenty of Microfiber cloth on hand. despite, two small cons, I highly recommend set item.

Well worth the price. These LED lamps light up the road so much better than the stock halogen lamps. My only wish is that KC would have left the "bubble" appearance of the OEM lamp, as opposed to the flat surface. The install was super easy too. I've installed many HID kits before, but this LED kit was by far easier. Fit is right on. Will have to wait a little so I can save up to buy the KC fog lamps as well.Because it is not projector-style, the beam pattern is a little scattered, but I feel that the reflector-style lights up a wider area. I saw another review where it said that the area close to the bumper was not lit up, which is true, but the upside to that is that the beam pattern is instead sent further, which I personally prefer. The fog lamps should cover the gap from the bumper to the beginning of the headlamp beam pattern with no problem.

This soap makes more suds than other name brand soaps, it's not extremely sudsy without a foam gun. Still pretty decent.  One of my pictures is a wash without a foam gun and one with.Another customer complained that it took wax off. I washed half of my hood with this soap and checked water beading and there was no difference. I don't think this takes wax off any more than any other car was soap. Overall this is a good product and it does smell good.

While I was working in Racoon City for an up and coming company in the health field I bought a tool box and to my surprise I find the company logo here on Amazon!  This emblem is a very sturdy product.  It comes with an adhesive strip on the back.  Peels off easy and is very sturdy.  I had to peel mine up and replace it since I hung it with a little slant.  It is a medal product with a nice shine to it and good detail in the writing.

Built all my own A/C lines and they turned out great.  The reason for the 4 star is that after first use and torquing on it, the pin that holds the two pieces together does not freely go in an out.  I have to tap it with a hammer to insert or remove it.  This only comes in to play when changing dies, so not a huge deal.  It does the job.

Update as I said the switchback was flicker flash on passenger side. So I switch 90 degree. It's working. Material look poor but still look like high quality if you know how to handle.

Ok first of all double check the battery you order before paying for it. I ordered  the 1.3AH batteries first by mistake. I contacted the sell who was more than reasonable and waived the restocking fee. I only needed to pay for the shipping and mail them back in. I then purchased these for my sons "GP RAZOR MINI CROTCH ROCKET" and they came with a full charge and work awesome. Couldn't be happier unless I would have ordered the right ones first.  In a nutshell good salesmanship and a good product for the price. Oh they had these same batteries at "Tractor Supply for like $32+ a piece. These guys sell two for cheaper and they offer free shipping.  COME ON THIS IS A NO BRAINER!!!

The Tyger step bars are aggressive looking, offer a lot of protection on the under side of the doors, and serve as the perfect height step to get into my Tundra. They were also very easy to instal with preexisting bolts and holes in the truck. Holes were perfectly drilled and no modifications were required. Installation took about 10 minutes per side and look great.

I have only used it for a month and it has really helped me see the work better. This light has a very sturdy/robust build with good clamping adjustability.  Good light output.  (same as the 2000 lumen led work light from ATD that I also use.  The led is only a few dollars more initial cost and should have a better ROI)Hope that this Light lasts more than 2 years after reading the other reviews.

I put this battery in my Evo X. This battery is about 5lbs,which is 33lbs lighter than my OEM Panasonic battary (38lbs) I only drive my car on the weekends and it works great. My car does not have any parasitic draw when the car is not driven. I got the Shorai LFX battery charger to balance my brand new shorai battery. The charger has the ability to balance each cell so it can get as close to the max charge of 14.4.My shorai battery was about 13.3v when I got it from amazon. I used Shorai's charger 3 times in a row as per their Website and their customer service in order to balance the battery to 14.3 which was the closest i could get to the max capacity. Then i installed it to my car and it works just like my OEM car batt no issues.

I ordered this item cause at night my armrest compartment and the compartment under my radio is so dark at night and I don't want to turn the bright dome light blinding me. Its just bright enough to see what there and the flat so not to get hung up on anything. Very easy to install just need a 12volt power. I wired them into the cigarette lighter so the light is on when the car is on and off when the car is off. The case is a black aluminum with an o-ring to help hold the light in place when tightening down the nut.

Since it still shines bright through both the limo TINT & the FOG, it's safe to say these are plenty bright!

After ready all of the reviews I decided to take a shot with this and ordered. I run the hard top in the winter so it does not make any sense to buy this. I run the Trektop NX in the summer and if you have one you know the fit is less than perfect on a JK. The gap between the header bar is often too much before a few years go by and the top stretches out a little. Here is what I find:1. At speeds of 70 mph the wind from the header bar area is excessive.2. With or without the deflector the wind is still excessive at over 70 mph.3. The deflector actually vibrates and makes a really strange noise at 70+ mph. (not a drum effect that others are mentioning.4. Really I see no difference because the deflector actually seems to create noise in the side rails where I never had noise before.My overall opinion is, might be a waste of money, does help a little at speeds near 65 mph and below. Overall it sticks on with 1/4" 3M tape and requires 48 hours of cure time. I placed two pieces of Gorilla Tape on the ends for a few days to make certain it stays secure. The ends do not line up perfectly and leave two small areas which can possibly loosen the tape over time. Once cured I plan to take another comments advice and put a couple small beads of silicone in those area.Not sure what people are saying about make sure its placed right......on my 2014 JKURX you have to almost be touching the window to install this so you can get your top up and down. The picture shown on the listing is just about impossible. I would imagine that the framed tops are the ones getting the drum affect.....that is why I bought the Trek NX top and replaced the frame model....it happens if you have the top up and the windows down just like the hard top.Anyhoo...those are my two cents.....kinda mixed right now whether it was worth buying or not.By the way, for the guy that screwed it down....what were you thinking when you did that?

I bought this on the word of a co-worker after he saw my wife's Escape.  Said it will last a good year on his car and I should try it.  I can't speak for longevity yet but the application was straight forward if you follow the directions.  I've used many spray waxes and trim restorers that work for a solid week or two, depending on how many times I wash it.  I will update as to how it holds up, I decided to do my Grand Cherokee as well.  Needed one bottle for each car and that BARELY did it.  I was impressed with the results and I also did the headlights on the Escape and that was impressive as well, nice that the kit included the headlight ssndpaper.  Posted before and after pics.  Certainly the most expensive try I've given the faded plastic so my expectations are a little higher, but if it makes it to next summer I will be very happy.  Use this product slowly, any missed spots will be VERY obvious and if you keep wiping it'll streak.

These are amazing lights. They are INCREDIBLY bright. Like, so bright that after I installed them to replace my fog lights, I can't use them at night because they will peel the paint off the hoods of oncoming vehicles! I love them! I've attached pix of them on my truck.

Robust in line fuse holders. States 10AWG, but it actually comes up shy of normal 10AWG outer diameter just a hair. I used these for fusing SLA batteries for use on my kids' power wheels and pegos. Copper is clean and tins wells. Braid is loose, but okay for my application. Fuse snaps in securely as does the protective cover.

 I use this balaclava to interchange between it and the Nike hyperwarm balaclava which I also purchased on Amazon and written a review on. I will therefore compare the toughgear balaclava with the Nike one. I may be nitpicking but I did find some advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages may have been magnified by the fact that I had used the Nike balaclava for 2 seasons a prior to using the toughgear and was used to it.Advantages.  The toughgear is slightly longer at the neck  and neck base/shoulder base area than its Nike counterpart. Also, the Nike balaclava tends to bunch upwards once you start exercising, which may leave your base of the neck cold if you don't have a long-necked top. The toughgear bunches up less and sometimes, not at all.  The toughgear seems to have more reflective signs. Nike has only one reflective swoosh at the front.  If you are primarily a mouth breather and you don't hydrate or eat during your aerobic activity, then the toughgear is for you as it has small breathing pores/holes at the front where your mouth is located. You can pull the balaclava down to align the pores/holes to your nose.  It keeps the noggin warm just as well as the Nike hyperwarm balaclava does. The warm material actually feels tougher than the Nike balaclava material.  Cleans easily. I wash mine in the washing machine and dry it by air dry (no heat) in the dryer or hang it inside the house to air dry. This will make it last longer and retain its elasticity.Disadvantages  The toughgear has a  'permanent' posture to it. Unlike the Nike balaclava which can be worn in 3 different ways, this toughgear has only 1 way to be worn. (I may be wrong.) Slid over the head and straightened out to cover the whole head up-to the nose, only leaving out the eyes.  Therefore, looking at the 'disadvantage' above, if you hydrate/take fluids or eat gels/energy bars while exercising, you have to pull the balaclava away from your nose and mouth to do this. If you look at the way it's made, the cloth close to the mouth and nose is a tad loose to allow for this but this looseness causes air to come in especially whilst cycling. In the beginning, especially when you are used to lowering part of the Nike balaclava to do this, it is harder and annoying. However, you get used to basically lowering the part of the balaclava covering your nose and mouth to drink/eat.  If you use your nose a lot to breath, then you have to pull part of the toughgear balaclava upwards so that the pores/holes at the front match with the nose. I found that hard to do.  If you wear the balaclava as intended and you breath through the nose, the material over the nose is thicker than the material of the Nike, so it is harder to breath through. The solution is to pull part of the balaclava upwards as stated above or just remove the part covering the nose and mouth. On a cold day below 20F, this may be uncomfortable and cold.  It doesn't 'hug' the noggin as much as the Nike does. I wear a size 7 1/8 hat and the Nike balaclava fits me perfectly. When running, this is not an issue as such but while cycling, some little cold air does pass through the toughgear. The solution is to pull the balaclava closer to the head contours which improves the situation but not quite 100%. Also, you can wear a beanie on top of the balaclava.  Just like all balaclavas everywhere, including the Nike, it doesn't eliminate the issue of a few icicles forming after your long cold run, especially close to your nose. That's just how balaclavas are.Due to the disadvantages, I'll knock off a star of an otherwise good product.

Super bright compared to ones I have gotten in the past. (See Pic, the purple ones are some other cheap brand) I will definitely be ordering more. Put some in my RV and some in the reverse lights on my 96 Accord. If you are looking for direct replacements for your old incandescent bulbs don't get any other brand. Trust me I have tried them all and these are superior. Night and Day difference, pun intended.

Car finally has a horn! Well it always had a horn but it sounded as old as the car, sounds like an old man shouting to get out of the way. With these it's more like, GTFO way!!! Or your ears are going to start bleeding!Also be sure to never use these unless necessary inside a parking garage, it makes them even louder.Mounting these are going to differ from car to car, like I had to make my own bracket otherwise it would not fit because my car has a crash sensor in the way, one of them fit without any issues though.  These are also 2x the size of my factory horns.I ran everything except for the factory horn wire with 12 gauge speaker wire from Monoprice. I "mounted" the relay to the side of my battery's carry handle with a zip tie.Now I just want to honk it but people are going think I'm crazy honking for no reason.

This is by far the best all in one product I have tried, and Ive used many compounds and polishes. I was blown away with the effortless wipe off, minimal dusting, and supreme shine and protection. And when used with the orbital polisher, it truly buffs out swirls and fine scratches extremely well. This isn't a gimmicky product at all. On a daily driver, or show car, this stuff is 5-stars across the board.

Great product!  Really made a difference in the looks of my Jeep.  Overall took an hour to install. The installation is pretty straight forward but kind of a pain, but if you're patient you should have little to no problems.  I didn't really encounter any of the issues others have commented on besides bending and forming in place.

I recently installed them on my bike and they work great. I ride to work everyday and get off at night so it's like 40ish during the day and 20-30 at night. They definitely help when riding. I have to use them on max however but that could be due to my thick gloves. If they made the heating elements displace heat over the whole grip than they would deserve a 5 start, but while riding I have to position my fingers right or they'll get cold.Ps: I was lazy and installed it directly to my battery and haven't had an issue for over a week. The lights really bright so it's hard to not turn off.Another note...... the grips aren't exactly the right size so there's a decent space between the throttle grip and a little space on the left grip and the end cap.

This product is terrible don't buy it. Just opened box today to install in truck been sitting on shelf for a month peice of garbage should have fully inspected it when I got it, and it's not Amazon's fault either. The box was flawless when it arrived, and no bits of cardboard or broken packing foam in the box. Has to be Spector there's a cut and dent on the side.  wish I could give this product negative 10 stars. The product has to be really bad for me to give this bad of a review.

These are just what I was looking for. With the days getting shorter in Autumn, I am often left cutting the grass as the sun goes down and into the darkness. These are so much better than the lights that come with my mower. It's like a completely different machine with these headlight bulbs. I specifically searched for the highest Lumens possible, and these exceeded my expectations.

Sounds fantastic on my 2000 Jeep Cherokee 4.0.Having also tried a Thursh Welded and Dynomax Super Turbo, this falls somewhere in the middle sound wise. You can tell it's not stock but it's not obnoxiously loud.It drones a little bit at 2200-2400rpm and nowhere else. Quiet at highway cruising speeds and still nice and audible during quick acceleration. Exactly the sound I wanted.Amazon also sells a 50 series heatshield that should be a nice replacement for the degraded factory one.

Well I'm bummed that I ordered the "black" set rather than the "smoked" I had intended on, but that was my own negligence.With that being said, they look just like they're supposed to. I'm not crazy about the gray trim line running around the edges, but they will still look a lot better than my factory tail lights for sure.I knocked 1 star off because honestly they had a lot cheaper of a feel to them than I had expected. I've never bought Spyder brand before, but they seem to carry a reputation and many people favor them above others. Anyways, on with the negative..These are extremely lightweight. The backside has black overspray and from being painted and, though it doesn't affect the finished appearance, there is a tacky feel like an adhesive not fully cured. I assume the process of refurbishing involves a second sealing, and that's why only 1 star is taken off. I'm more than okay with it getting a second seal if the manufacturer sees it necessary. I wouldn't think to seal it, myself.. so it more than likely saved me from a headache on down the road.I just don't see the quality in this product for 5 stars. I do feel they were worth the half price tag for used condition, though. I just really wish I had ordered the smoke.. they match my headlights perfectly. Perhaps in a few months after giving this set a try.Will edit of anything changes after installation.

Not a very good product. I have not tried to put this on my car yet so I do not know how it will fit (waiting until I put it in storage for the winter). I was upset on how I received the product. The carrying bag had a huge rip in it and it was just tapped shut. The cover itself had a large piece of wood stuck in the side of it.

I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good modernd battery charger should do.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE (11-27-12). Gold box special was $25.25 + tax. (I would likely buy it at the regular price for $31.65)It's basically semi-automatic. You do have to set the current otherwise it will default to 2A. When I 1st used the charger the voltage defaulted to 12V. There is a button to select 6V or 12V. You won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently (I tried it intentionally). Compact size and reasonable quality clamps (not brass or brass plated though).It does not come with quick disconnect charge connector or maintainer cable to permanently install on your battery.Quiet: Mine has no humming or buzzing as another has noted. It does have a small fan that does not turn off, but you can barely hear it..This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge batteries big and small and top off or maintain batteries as needed.This works well as an maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. After charge is complete the current shuts off and charger goes into maintenance mode where it monitors battery voltage and starts charging again when the battery drops below a preset level. (should be about 12.75V)I did check the charger current and shutoff for maintenance mode. (See detail below)The charger is relatively small, light weight and feels feels reasonably well built with medium weight plastic. The charger has a small cooling fan and does not get warm after charging at 6A. The battery clamps are not great but good enough.LED indicators: I really like the charge status lEDs for 25% 50%, 75% and 100% (or Charged)I gave this charger 4.5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is decent as well.Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge or 25% discharge.(Typical full charge is 12.7V to 12.75V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal to measure charging current.I set the charge current to 6A1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 4.2A. Charger indicated 25% charge2) After 30min the charge current was 3.61A. Charge voltage is 13.19V. Charger indicated 25% charge3) After 1 hour the charge current is 3.61A. Charge voltage is 13.38V. Charger indicated 25% charge4) After 1.5 hours the charge current is 2.84A. Charge voltage is 13.60V. Charger indicated 50% charge5) After 2 hours the charge current is 2.47A. Charge voltage is 13.95V. Charger indicated 50% chargeNote: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 2.5 hours the charge current is 1.74A. Charge voltage is 14.63V.  Charger indicated 75% charge7) After 3 hours the charge current is 0.33A. Charge voltage is 14.79V. Charger indicated 75% charge8) After 3.5 hours the charge current is 0.22A. Charge voltage is 14.80V. Charger indicated 75% charge9) After 3.75 hours the charge current is 0.0A. Charge voltage is 13.57V. Charger indicated 100% chargeCharger is now in the monitor mode/maintenance. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 7.5W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Note that the charger did not charge at the set current of 6A. Apparently the battery was not low enough for a 6A charge rate.(My opinion) This charger did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current AUTOMATICALLY declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon.Note 12-17-12: I just found out a friend of mine has been using this exact model for a few years to maintain his motorcycle batteries. He's happy with it. Never had a problem with it.

I bought this to replace the stock halogen light on my 2012 H-D Ultra Classic.  I seriously considered other lights from China for about 1/2 the price, but in the end I decided the top reviewed light was worth the extra money.  I found a really good review on 12 different LED lights on YouTube under the title: JW Speaker 8700 Evo 2 Demo and Review (7 Inch Round LED Headlight Shootout 6 of 12)  Helped me make my decision.This has a slightly different light pattern that the 2015 H-D LED that was on my Dad's bike.  These LEDs have very similar profiles from side to side compared to the OEM lights, but they look to provide more light in the center when using the high beams.  The low beams looked identical.I'd probably have given this product a 5 star rating, but after about 15-20 minutes of use while checking function and getting it pointed correctly, the light would no longer switch to low beams (stuck on highs).  I took it apart and verified the old light worked properly and that this one no longer did.  Amazon, of course provided a full refund as soon as UPS scanned my barcode for the return.  I'll try to get back and change my rating assuming the next one works properly!UPDATE:  Lights work perfectly and are CONSIDERABLY brighter than the stock headlights.  See attached photo for comparison.  Stock Halogen is on the left and the new LED on the right.  25 feet away from door.  In addition to being brighter, notice how much more side light there is.  Even more obvious when you are outside on the road.  Really lights up the sides of the road as well as the distance.

I work under streetlights at all hours of the night. My company requires that I strobe a light while on the road to let pedestrians know that i'm not some creepy stalker, at least not a creepy stalker while on the clock. Jk.  I had an old fashioned yellow spinning light that was in dire need of an upgrade. When Niilight approached me for a review I eagerly accepted. My companys logo is green based so this light compliments the decal on my car. It certainly lets people know that you're there.The unit is definitely larger than I expected ( I didn't read the specs ) 13 x 7.3 x 3.3 inches but it isn't heavy. I'll be taking this to a light installation in Canada over the winter so be assured that I will give it a full and thorough test. Should anything break I will report back.Room for improvement:I'd love to see a standard plug option. I run an inverter in my car and having the option to plug  this in would be far more convenient.Please feel free to ask any questions.Thank you for reading!

NOT WORTH THE MONEYI received a set of 3D Maxpider about 4 months ago as a gift. They look great and possibly the nicest design out there and they seemed to be very well made. They aren't inexpensive so you would expect them to last a reasonable amount of time.  I took my mats out today to clean and noticed the rectangle heel pad area had separated while I was dusting them. It looks like the bonding had failed or they were cheap with the adhesive and only glued the extreme perimeter of the the heel pad.Pictures shows the lifting separating heel pad, the product tag looking brand new and clean, the underside pristine and the top with the 3D logo with the clear protective plastic still on it.These floor mats are in my RX330 and looked nice for a short while.If the manufacturer reads this feel free to contact me to replace this item.

First of all these guards look great on my 2013 4 door Rubicon. Yes, they do fit the 13's perfectly. I cross checked the manufacturer part number before ordering. Amazon needs to upgrade that info. Now the nuts and bolts of it. I also knew before ordering by reading the install instructions online that these bolt on in only two places towards the ends. They should have added connection point in the middle because if you hit hard that's where it'll affect you the most. I guess they figure it's strong enough, we'll see. For that, 4 stars. Install is a piece of cake and took about an hour by myself and that's with removing the Rubi rails too. I found if you keep the body mount bolts really loose tightning the nuts that actually hold it on is much easier. Not a lot of room up in there. There is a left and right side they don't tell you that so make sure you slide them in from the outside to be sure which is which before you start. As I stated in other reviews on their bumper and skid plate the finish tends to chip easily. Before I put anything on I give it a light sanding, wipe it down with lacquer thinner, and give it a few coats of SEM satin black from a rattle can. If any of that chips I have the right paint to touch it up. I even used it to paint the area where the Rubi rails came off, it was kind of ugly under there once they were removed. Now I'm thinking of cutting the ends off the Rubi rails and reinstalling them, if they fit.

I really like these hinge mounts. They're tough enough and the lock option is a good thought. Since they don't offer mounting instructions, I thought I'd take some photos so anyone who needs it can see how I did mine.Tools needed:Torx T40 bit and a good size socket wrench. I didn't need a breaker bar, but mine were in pretty tight.T40 angled wrench (like an allen wrench)19mm open end wrenchDeep socket 19mmTowel or blanket to protect your hoodOptional black spray paint to make your ugly jack look better on your awesome Jeep hood.In the box there were two sets of mounting screws. Look at the label and pick the one for your Jeep (TJ or YJ). I'm mounting mine on a 01 TJ.Now is a good time to touch up the paint on your jack, if needed.Take out the existing screws. Put on the brackets with the new screws finger tight. Mount the bracket with the locking hole on the driver's side.Make sure the brackets are aligned with the back edge of the hood and tighten them down (see photos).Put bolt up through mounting hole on passenger side. Tighten with 19mm wrench and socket.Do the same on driver side but leave nut lose so you have room to adjust for position through hole.Put jack on bolts, slide bolt up through hole on driver side, holding bolt in position, lift jack handle off and out of the way. Finish tightening nut.Put jack back on and tighten with wing nuts.I hope this helps someone with the installation. Good luck!

Finally tried mine on a 3 hr trip to Bowling Green and back . Pretty much works as advertised , quality and fit are good . Be aware on a base C7 you will need to loosen 2 lower fairing screws to tuck the corners under and retighten the screws , other than that its an easy install . This will not stop rock chips at Highway speeds in my opinion though , seemed like I had a couple new ones after I removed it .

It's useable...but it's sure not white...  It looks like it was left outside in the heat for a few weeks...it's all brown and yucky looking.  I'm using it on machine threads that aren't really visible, but if I needed something that looked pretty, this ain't it....

I purchased this frame for my wife as a Christmas gift.  She hasn't seen it yet so I will give my impressions and observations in this review.Pros:1. It comes in a really classy looking gift box.  That's definitely preferable to the standard packaging I saw most other frames come in at local stores, especially when giving this item as a gift.2. The overall appearance of the frame is outstanding.  The manufacturer says there are more than 720 rhinestones included and I don't doubt it.  If you're looking for bling, you've found it.  I actually think the manufacturer should retake their photos here on Amazon because the product is better than the photos represent.3. Extra rhinestones were included should they ever fall off the frame.  The existing ones seem very solidly secured to the frame.4. This frame included 2 matching screws and caps for them with rhinestones embedded in the caps.5. The frame is made of stainless steel so it should be durable and free of rust.6. The frame was very nicely protected inside the gift box.  It sits in a foam insert and is covered on top by a foam protective sheet.Cons:1. There are no cons that I found.Overall this is a gorgeous product that I know my wife is going to adore and be proud to display on her car.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.

This is an excellent rack for transporting kayaks with a pick-up truck.  I have a 2011, F-150 Lariat Super Crew with a short bed.  My wife and I purchased two, 14' Wilderness Pungo 140 kayaks and we needed a way to transport them.  I was looking seriously at purchasing a set of $700 Thule or  $400 Trac-Rack bed racks.  Most of the kayakers and paddleboarders I talked to said that these bed extenders are the best way to transport your watersports equipment.After just one use I was convinced I had made the right decision and saved a ton of cash in the process.  This rack is heavy duty, easy to set up and easy to store.  I can install the rack in my hitch, load the kayaks, and be on my way in about 10 minutes.  It can be used on any vehicle with a 1" or 2" receiver trailer hitch.  It comes with an adapter for a 1" receiver hitch.  It can be configured vertically also. You can place your watersports equipment on the roof of your vehicle and in the yoke of the rack.You will need to purchase a receiver hitch pin since that is not included.  I also purchased lashing straps and a red bungee flag from Amazon.Don't get ripped off by paying for high priced, name brand, racks.  If you purchase this bed extender, you won't be disappointed.

I sprayed 3 coats in 9 minutes, atleast thats what i tnought tbe directions said without my glasses, the chrome headlight im trying to paint looked so good before i applied the duplicolor adhesion, after each coat i saw the chrome get cloudier and cloudier, i thought oh man , i may have to strip it off cause it looks not good, but i decided to continue following the directions,  after i put  them on i found out i was supposed to wait 10 between coats lol,  oh well.. anyway, after the 3 coats in 9 minutes i waited 3 hours before i sprayed the duplicolor metalcast red.  After each spray i noticed it was getting Prettier and preitter, and after 5 coats you can see im very happy with the results

The carrier arrived in 2 days and it seems to be of good quality. Assembly was easy. It is larger than I had pictured (even though reviews had warned me). I consider myself a strong female but carrying this and putting it on my jeep is a bit of a struggle for me. I can do it, but having help would be good. Also, I had to put my first load on a little off center to make it all fit and it was a little crooked but it seemed stable. A note for wrangler owners: you can only open the back a tiny bit with this on. I made the mistake of mounting it with my rear window rolled up and there wasn't enough room to open the gate to propley secure it back so some rain got in even with it zipped. It isn't a big deal, just know you can't get in the back with this attached.

I ordered 2 bottles of this and it only took one on a large convertible top . A 70 impala . This was really easy to use and worked great . Just like any product preparation is key . Make sure you get a good degreaser and clean it really well . Let it dry and put on thin coats . I did 3 coats and still have a half bottle . I was going to send back 1 of my orders but it also worked really well on my living room black leather furniture also so I'm keeping this stuff for sure . Very happy with the way my top turned out . Looks bran new . Use there cleaner and sealer product as well .

These tail lights are of really good quality and look great! I own a 2010 4Runner and these lights (which are meant for the 2014+ 5th Gen) plugged right into the existing wiring harness and worked perfectly. The bolt/fastener patterns are identical. Great fit, great look and upgrade. I believe Toyota wants around $250 for each light and you still need to buy a sub-harness (if you're upgrading lights like I did).

I just received the Fox Bombers Gloves, and I am not pleased with the overall quality.These gloves look like "B-Stock" or Manufacturers defect quality.  I paid full price, and the build quality is simply unacceptable.There are areas of stitching that are completely missing.  There are other areas where the stitching appears to be loose or not tied off.  The worst area appears to be the receiving end of the Velcro wrist strap, which is missing half of the single ply stitches.  The holes from the needle are visible, but there is no sign of thread.Overall, the gloves have a nice tight fit.  They are a good design, but I can not recommended them based on the build quality.  I haven't even used them yet, and they are falling apart....  I am a bit disappointed, and I expected more from the Fox brand.  Now I have to waist my time and return them.  I do not plan on buying the same brand.They are made in China, but so is my iPhone that I am using to type this review with.  I expect better quality control.  I will update with any changes.Do not buy.

Every single person needs one of these in their car, you can never predict the future, but you can always be prepared for it. This has everything you need, until a paramedic arrives. This has everything I could have asked for in a kit. Sure, you can always make your own, but this is such a good deal for something that could easily save your life or another person's. Honestly, if you don't have a first aid kit in your vehicle, get one! Even if you'll never use it, its always important to be prepared for anything.

My Fleece Mask keeps my face warm in cold days that I have to ride my motorcycle. I would recomend it to all my riding budies. I don't have a problem with the fogging of my wind shield on my helmit or shades. The mask is soft and made of good quality. This product is money well spent.

I purchased (3) of these windshield shades on 07/27/2016 and only read the product description (and NOT comments from unlike reviewers).I have to agree this windshield shades are made very bad materials.  After 1.5 weeks of using from 3 differents people in my family and all three came back to me and said this is a very very poor materials and colors.  I purchased (2) blue + (1) red...the red now is changing color into kidda orange and the blue is really light blue and they are all crack and the plastic bubbles are popped.I was wonder this company has a nice looking windshield sunshades and why not invest to have a better quality.  I am go back and using my 5 years old windshield sunshade.If you are out there thinking about this windshield then do yourself a favor and not waste your time and money on this one.  Believe me it is the worst quality ever.I am including 2 pic...the pretty from amazon website and the ugly one that i purchased after 1.5 weeks of use.

This compound is great for alleviating (not removing) scratches. It does a good job softly "sanding" down the scratches. We were able to remove some noticeable scratches! What it seems to do is fill in the rough patches with some goo and then smooth it out. It's almost like magic. It's night and day. Some of the bigger scratches are still there, but the scratches feel muted and slightly clearer.Recommended to try!

Fits the drawer well and separates the screwdrivers as designed. Replaced another name brand that just didn't fit my drawer well but I wish these had some sort of neoprene snugger to keep tools from sliding as drawer opens and closes.  Had to drill holes to allow my stubby drivers to fit as the handles were too wide to fit into channel.

Thanks to other reviewers that took pictures and gave measurements of these jaws. They fit perfect on my vise and allow to grip round objects without messing up the surface. Magnets hold them in place good enough so they don't fall off, but still easy to shift around to get the indents to align when you are gripping something round. Quality milled surface, I didn't see any burrs or anything.

First off,my intended use of the product is to serve as a reverse light on a hitch mounted motorcycle carrier. I give it 4 stars because I only hooked it up today,to simply test the diodes and make sure they all worked. They did. I see that this light does take on water over time,based on other reviews. Inspection of the rear mounted power cord did reveal that water would absolutely enter that location. I took my go to sealer ( DAP Marine grade Silicon ) and sealed the rear around the cord. I observed the light pattern tonight and it shoots out around 15 feet but in a more narrow pattern than I had hoped for. It will work for my use. Will test it in the rain to see if this takes on water from the front gasket.

Ten step process while installing my LED.I installed this on my 2014 Harley Davidson Sportster Superlow. 1 yes it is a plug and play for my year. 2 it would not fit perfectly inside the headlight housing because of the three prong plug. 3 I tried to bend the tabs around the bezel of the housing to see if it will help, it did not. 4 I ended up taking out some of the slack from the original housing by feeding the wire through the housing plug, and yes it helped a little. 5 small LED goes on top. I noticed the square beam when adjusting my head light and to my opinion it is slightly brighter than stock. 6 high beam just adds more light around the square beam but it helps. 7 For me I can see I will be noticed and identified as a motorcycle to other drivers ahead because of the head light color and brightness. 8 As you can see it looks good with my 1/4 fairing when it is turned off. 9 In the box you can see I did not use my stock headlight ring nor did I use the extra canbus harness. 10 It took me an hour and a half to complete this just because I wanted the LED light to fit perfectly on the housing and with the help of my wife's hands as I held the LED in place she tightened the headlight trim scew.This was my alternative to buying the HD brand Day Maker and it sure saved me some cash. My brother bought the same light for his 2015 HD 48 and he said it took him 5 minutes to install. Go figure....

Man I freaking love this bed cover.  Super nice, and fits my 2012 Nissan Titan like a glove.  If you have the utility track system in your bed, this is definitely the cover for you.  It comes with Utility Track spacer/adapters to make installation super easy.  It lays down flat forming a water tight barrier, and also comes with a tail gate weather strip.  The mounting clamps are adjustable, you can actually take them off and they have 3 different mounting holes to choose from.  I mounted mine in the inner-most mounting positions for all 4 clamps and it fit perfectly for my Titan.  Bonus, mine came with a magnetic light for the bed.

This unique little tire pressure gauge is great.It is so easy to use. Just insert onto your tires valve stem and it instantly gives you your tire pressure in a digital read-out form. VERY EASY TO USE !When you have inserted the gauge and have retrieved your pressure, in order to clear the read-out and move on to the next tire, you simply hold the power button down for 3 seconds and it clears. When you want to turn the device off, you simply hold the power button down for approximately 10 seconds your just wait 1 minute and it will shut itself off automatically.The display for the LED read-out is actually back-lit. So if you are checking tire pressure in the dark, on the road or in your garage, you can see vividly, the display from the brightly lit blue, LED Screen.This tire gauge is also ingenious as it can read in numerous Pressure Units. Whether it be PSI (Pounds per Square Inch as most tire pressures in the USA are measured in) or it can also read in KPA and BAR Measurements too. Simply press the power button until it scrolls to the Pressure Unit that you desire to measure in.The ergonomics of this gauge are really well thought out. It fits nicely in the palm of your hand it does not slip out of your grip. It has a finish to the surface that is somewhat anti-slip also.This gauge will read from 3 PSI to 100 PSI.It comes complete with an installed battery and is ready to operate directly out of the box.The gauge comes complete with a Users Manual too.One thing I must mention, although this gauge is a great tool, I think it may be a little large to put on the end of your key ring and put your keys in your pocket. It will certainly do the job if you like to have a large key-chain device attached to your keys so that you don't easily loose your keys. But if you are like me and you put your keys in your pocket after using them, then this tire air pressure gauge would be too large for that.The tool came package nicely in a colorful and durable box. It would make a perfect gift to anyone from a young boy who enjoys maintaining his bicycle to a Big Rig Trucker who may need to check his tires air pressure regularly or anyone in between who simply drives the family car.All in all, this certainly is a product that I would be very proud to recommend, to keep for myself or to give as a gift.Hopefully I have addressed all of your concerns or questions that you may have had. In case I may have missed something, I have added a few pictures to my review so that you can see exactly what the product I have received is like without viewing some modified, or professionally photo-shopped images with special lighting that make the product appear like more than what you will receive. These attached pictures are straight out of my point-and-shoot camera and are unedited.Just so you know, I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. But this in no way has influenced my opinion of this fine product.If you have enjoyed reading my review or If my attached pictures and description has helped you in any way, don't forget to please mark my review as "helpful" or vote "yes" as helpful please at the bottom of my review. I would really appreciate that and it helps encourage me to keep writing reviews of my purchases for you and others to read...

I just installed the sticker to my drivers side mirror. Looks great and initially it looks like good quality. I'll post an update after it's been on for a while. I've included some pics of the install. Basically, I cleaned the mirror, applied the sticker and then used a credit card to burnish the sticker with the protective cover still on the sticker. I then carefully removed the protective cover and presto! I tried to show how big the sticker is and how it fits on the mirror. I received 2 stickers and each are 5 3/8" wide X 6" tall.

Very nice and easy to install bit of kit.  I had purchased an LED third brake light for my miata (1999) and integrated this directly into the wiring of the light itself.  Programming the unit was very easy and I had it setup and ready for install in well under an hour.  I bought this kit because I really wanted the delay of reactivating the flasher so it wouldn't annoy people behind me in heavy traffic.  I also figured it might keep LEO from pulling me over.  Overall, a great product that was packaged very well (meaning it included most of the accessories to install, and a good manual).  Would definitely buy again!In my photo, the flasher unit is to the left.  I used the bullet connectors to allow for quick connect/disconnect if the police ever gave me problems.

These are nice LED head light bulbs for your vehicle. These come with a helpful instruction booklet to help you proceed with removing your old bulbs and installing these. You may also need to look at your vehicle's instruction manual or find an online tutorial for accessing and replacing the head light bulbs in your vehicle. The light on these is whiter (less yellowish) than on traditional halogen bulbs. These are worth getting, offering a brighter light and using less power than non-LED bulbs. I was provided a free sample of these for my honest, unbiased review.

The FMS neck pillow is a terrific addition to my Mercedes wagon.  The color matches perfectly and it sits just right in that gap just between the headrest in the seat.  It has a snap in buckle with elastic straps  for easy installation.Once you lean back and your head lays on it - watch out!  You may fall asleep because it feels like you are in heaven.  I actually close my eyes in pleasure every time my heads hits the pillow.  It sits in that area on your neck where you get no support from just a regular headrest.The pillowcase is removable for washing.Product sample provided for review.

I've owned my Mini Duster for three years and find it is perfect for small places and tight spots. My only complaint is that the mop head fibers could be just a tiny bit longer. I believe if that were the case, it would perform better at lifting dust from areas that are like "fake" honeycomb (like in the attached picture.) The fibers on the standard are too thick for that type job. Otherwise, this is a superb product and I will be buying another very soon.

With a bit of wiring harness pulled from a junkyard Jeep, I added this to my Subaru.I'm very pleased with the light it produces. It's much brighter than the OEM underhood light on my old F150.The actual switch inside it is disconcertingly crude- just a rattly ball that rolls onto contacts when the hood is raised- but it's much more effective and reliable than, for example, the mercury switch in my old F150.

I used these for my 2016 Crosstrek. The wiring is the same, but the mounts are different on this kit. I slid the LED out from the metal bracket and used form adhesive to mount on the factory spot. Why this kit? Because its the same lights and connectors, but $100 less than the new kit.

Plow arrived quickly and complete over a period of 2 days. Plow is built very stout and works as you would expect a plow to work. Would be nice if  it was supplied with higher grade bolts. I replaced the 3 bolts for the front winch hook attachment point with longer grade #8 and lock nuts because they loosened up after first use. Not a big deal only $2.50. I recommend at least a 3500 lb. winch. That way your winch won't have to work so hard and it will last longer. I purchased a viper 5000 lb. Elite, but that's just me, I like to go over kill. It gives me peace of mind. That's why I like this plow, Its built really well so I feel it should be durable an last quite a while . I actually installed it on my 2010 Nissan frontier to plow my driveway. Its only as wide as the wheel track of my vehicle but that's not really a issue I just make 3/4 plow width passes after the first initial pass. All in all I like it. And its ( WAY CHEAPER ) than alternative plow options on the market. Good job Moto Alliance!

I reviewed all of the reviews before purchasing and one guy finally said it; don't do the whole spring clip thing which sounds impossible. Pop rivet that sucker in! It doesn't exactly line up with the opening as there is a little wiggle room, but I got three rivets to catch and it is perfect and only took five minutes.  That makes very short work of the job and may very happy with my purchase :-)

I often take my Mustang to car shows. There is nothing worse than washing your car, just to have road dust settle on it and take away the shine. It's not like I can drive out of the show to wash my car again. That's where this handy duster comes in handy. I pull in to the show and then a quick dust of the car, and it looks freshly waxed! The soft duster is easy of the paint and wax, and it breaks apart into a small bag that easily fits in any trunk. I you love your car, then you car needs this! The microfiber towel is pretty handy for dusting the interior of the car too.

Do not purchase this. I purchased it for my 95 BMW M3. I open the box and the clip falls out. I push it back it falls out again. Then I inserted this clip on the car with the shock... The shock fell out of the mount. This is not safe whatever. Terrible product. I will not recommend at all. I want a refund

This is a prefect fit for a 2002 Chevy Tahoe.  It does not come with the top mounting bolt and nut.  For the price it should include everything needed for a full replacement. As a result 3 stars, being the part description is false in saying "includes all hardware".

Awesome light bar, so far it works great ive had it for about 2 weeks and its bright as hell! The only complaint is the wire comes out at a funny angle and is kinda smashed in the in channel brackets i bought separately but other then that it looks UPDATE: I have now found out that the halos like to change colors on their own... not sure why but kind of irritating to keep switching it back while driving.

Struggled for years with my trunk organizer moving around in the trunk of my vehicle.These held everything in place including my grocery bag, in fact I only used two of the pieces (comes with four) to hold the trunk organizer in place up against the back of the trunk and used the other two to hold my grocery bag up against my trunk organizer.Hehe...., to my surprise everything stays put !Though I didn't take a pic of the undersides of the product, it has super grip flat rubber pieces which works well with my trunks carpet.Great product and would recommend it to anyone....Simple yet, Effective.TIP: give them a fast swipe of "Denatured Alcohol" on the rubber base, located underneath will restore grip.Hehe, hopefully you won't wait as long as I did and ask yourself why....Duh!

Works great for my 2011 Hyundai Sonata SE! Made changing the oil a breeze. The bolt it replaced was angled so it doesn't poke down to far as to get clipped by something off the road. Put a plastic tube on it and it dumps directly into a container without a mess. I'm quite pleased with it.

Likes: Awesome Design (Its billet and avoids all the pastic) Simple Installation (just pop the old fuel door of challenger out by reaching under the wheel splash guard) Option to not use the fuel emblem (I replaced mine with one from Billet Tech)Suggestions: The carbon print emblem is not real carbon fiber I really think it detracts from it which is why I didn't use it. See my picturesThe Bottom Line:If you are looking to change the way your challenger looks this is a really neat mod. The black with Faux bolts makes pops.  Check out the pics, feel free to ask any questions.  Please Note my pictures show me adding a different emblem.

This light fits other bikes better than the Harleys.  I have a 2006 yamaha Royal star.  Absolute breeze to install. Like it was made for it all tabs lined up pluged straight in and boom!! Great light.  Would have given it 5 stars but after couple rides bright stoped working. So i took out the flicker plug and it solved the problem. Dont know how but it did.  Oh and the passing lights fit great as well.

Installation was pretty easy.  The pictures and instructions were fairly clear and helpful.My truck is brand new (18); and I think that probably made a difference when it comes to bolt removal and re-installation. But some good penetrating oil can help if you have an older model that's seen a lot of grime from the road.The bars look good. Like others, I was concerned that 3" was going to be too small; but I think they look fine. Of course, these are far from the factory ones, but for the price, I'm not complaining.As for durability, time will tell. I live in the northeast, so I expect they will take some abuse come winter when the roads get coated with all kinds of junk.I have stood on them, and they don't bow or wobble, and I'm over 200 lbs. My decision to get them was to help my son get in and out easier. He's pretty happy with it. Plus they're not made to ride on or hang on. They're only an aid to entry and exit.All in all, they seem good for the money. Perhaps I'll update this review in 6 months or so to see where we are. But for now, they seem to fit the bill.

Being self contained and having the pager function is just superb, and the price is nice too. I haven't had a motorcycle in years, but I have become an avid Mountain Biker. I have three tricked out mtn. bikes that I have put a lot of time into upgrading with parts and accessories. I live in Montana and have to drive about 5-15 miles with my bikes on my Swagman Dual Bike Rack:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Swagman-XC-Cross-Country-2-Bike-Hitch-Mount-Rack-1-1-4-and-2-Inch-Receiver/dp/B0001VO1YY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Swagman XC Cross-Country 2-Bike Hitch Mount Rack (1/1/4 and 2-Inch Receiver)</a>. The roads from my home to the trail heads are absolutely NOT "bike friendly"!, but there are some bike friendly bike lanes in and around town and the MSU campus.The "Bully" is the perfect solution for both my 2 Trail Mountain Bikes and my one In Town Commuting Mountain Bike. It's common knowledge that many U-Locks can be defeated with a simple "Scissor Jack", so the Bully's pager/paging function is just essential. Now with the Bully with me I can ride my commuter rig to the gym, stores, etc. without worry. In addition, After a day of trail riding with a friend or date, we can stop at a restaurant after a hard day of riding and not have to worry about the bikes as they are secured to my Swagman hitch bike rack with the Bully and I have the pager with me!The Pagers range is very good, and I have not had any signal reception problems. The Bully product info says it's water resistant, but it really virtually water proof. Importantly, THE BULLY U-LOCK USES A STANDARD 9v BATTERY AND THE PAGER USES A STANDARD "AAA" BATTERY! I put Lithium batteries in both! No messing with silly oddball watch batteries!Using the Bully lock and pager is a little confusing at first, so read the manual carefully. You'll soon figure out that One Beep means the Bully is armed, and One Beep on the pager means it's on and active. Two beeps on the Bully lock and on the pager means they are Unarmed and Off respectively. Amazon (and Motorcycle Superstore) were both great; the Bully was well packaged and arrived quickly to Bozeman, MT.I had been looking at $100 Heavy Duty Chain Locks:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Kryptonite-New-York-1217-Bicycle-Chain-Lock-and-Evolution-Series-4-Disc-Lock-5-Foot-x-5-Inch/dp/B001N888OS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Kryptonite New York 1217 Bicycle Chain Lock and Evolution Series 4 Disc Lock (5-Foot x 5-Inch)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Kryptonite-New-York-Fahgettaboudit-Chain-with-Disc-Lock-5-Ft/dp/B004R9KSWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit Chain with Disc Lock - 5 Ft./--</a>, but man am I glad I found the Bully.

Solid. Worked great on my rzr and lets you easily use the factory stop lamps as turn signals. There are 4 output wires on this. One for each corner of the vehicle. This is so you can use it on dual filament brake lamp systems. It shuts off current flow from the brake light circuit to the side that needs to flash. Anyway, good looking switch.

I purchased 3 of these, and I love them! They look great! In my opinion, they look better than the other ones currently available. I tried the Classic Edition but I felt that they were too thick compared to these. These are 1/4" thinner, so they look much better. One of my vehicles uses only the two top screws to mount it, and it feels very secure.Screws are included (4 M6 metric machine and 4 1/4" coarse thread). The screws should fit Hondas/Acuras/Toyotas/many domestics and others but may not fit certain BMWs (you might be able to reuse your screws). I'm using screws from the "Cruiser Accessories 81500 Stainless Steel Ultimate Kit Star Pin Locking Fastener" kit.The seller EuroBumperGuard is excellent. Very good communication and they take great care of you!One suggestion to BumpTek is to engineer a way to hide the opening for the plate. Right now the top of the plate is visible through the slot, so I had to blacken the top of the plate to make it look nicer. If the top opening could be hidden with some sort of fold-over piece of rubber, it would look even better. On one of my vehicles that uses 4 screws, I'm thinking about mounting it upside down though the logo would also be upside down as well, but at least it should look much better. And I wouldn't mind if you came out with an even thinner version as well.Overall, I am very pleased with these!

Took me 6 hours from jacking up to putting wheels back on. I took all the wheels off and started painting one at a time. Made it around three times and the paint never turned sticky. I had fans blowing on the calipers to help dry the paint as I worked my way around. Plenty of paint left over I could have put 5 coats plus on them. It would probably do two vehicles but who has 8 jack stands.

My Truck: 2009 F150 XLTI had issues with my first bar.  I did a bunch of research on cheap 52" light bars before making this purchase.  I was totally aware of the possible wind noise problem and the seal issue some people have.  When I received the first bar I hooked it up to make sure all the led's were working then I took the front housing apart and put a beed of Amazing Goop sealant in there to eliminate any moisture problems.  This took over an hour as there were a lot of allen bolts.  I installed it any it all worked.Took it for a test drive and LED's started going out.  After 3 days with intermittent use and testing all the led's had died.  I'm not sure what the cause was, but I sent it back for a replacement.  The replacement has worked flawlessly, and I did not crack this one open to add any sealant.The Wind Noise + Fix:Ok so this was a HUGE issue for me.  After having it mounted on the truck for 3 weeks I was ready to take it down and send it back.  Anything over 50mph caused this horrible noise that sounded like a tuning fork.  It was driving me crazy.  I even tried the door trim fix and it didn't fix the problem!  That's when I figured out the noise was coming from the air flowing over the fins causing the reverberation in the fins.  I went to HomeDepot and picked up a rubber garage door seal, and wedged the rubber T of each end in-between the 2 fins on top and the 2 fins on the bottom, and BAM!  It was fixed.  It's had no tuning fork issue since.  There is some wind noise, but I've owned several cars with bars on-top of them and it's about the same noise.  It's totally bearable and most of my passengers don't notice it.  Amazon sells a similar product&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/M-D-Building-Products-87643-9-Feet-Universal-Aluminum-and-Rubber-Garage-Door-Bottom-Black/dp/B0006VALUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">M-D Building Products 87643 9-Feet Universal Aluminum and Rubber Garage Door Bottom, Black</a>&nbsp;but I found it cheaper at HomeDepot.Light Output:Man is this thing bright!  It totally lights up the road.  Now you can't compare this to a bar that costs $1,000+ because it's not going to compete.  This light is defiantly more of flood light.  It does a really good job out to about 60'/ 100' of the truck, and there is a really good spread on it.  I can see what's down in the ditches on both sides of the road like it's daylight.  In the desert, and while camping it's great for seeing everything around you at close distances.  If you are looking for something that penetrates out in-front of you this is not the light for you.  My headlights (non HID) seem to penetrate a little farther than this bar.  I'll be purchasing a 30"ish spot LED bar to mount on my bumper at some point to get that penetrating light.  Now with it being mounted on the roof there is a downfall.  If there is heavy dust it will cause a bad haze and be difficult to see out of the front windshield.  Similarly if the hood/ or front windshield is dirty you will get some light reflection off of both of these surfaces causing some visibility issues.Mounting:I bought the 54" Rough Country Mounts from their website&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rough-Country-70518-54-inch-Curved-LED-Light-Bar-Upper-Windshield-Mounting-Brackets-Ford-F150/dp/B00SCDC302/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rough Country - 70518 - 54-inch Curved LED Light Bar Upper Windshield Mounting Brackets (Ford F150)</a>&nbsp;but I would imagine the Eyourlife brackets would work, as they look exactly the same.  They didn't exist when I purchased my bar.

This is the most attractively priced electric-start generator I have found. Most of them in this size range are pull-start only, which can be a challenge when the user is a single mom only 5'1" height. This one is nice and easy to start, and the wheel kit makes it easy to move around, so you can get it outside where it belongs when in use to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. This is easy to start, and runs well. It is not too noisy, but not what I would call quiet either. Fuel economy is better than average, and the tank is big (4 gallons).When the battery eventually gives up, and this is not an if but a when, especially when you don't fire the genny up monthly and connect a float charger to the battery when not in use, you will discover to your frustration that the battery has no useful information printed on it, just some very strangely worded warning labels (see photos).  After many hours of research you will find very few sellers offering anything that is both the right size and the right terminal configuration, especially when you don't have a number to go by. So, write this number down, FPM7-12A. Better yet, make a P-touch label with it and stick it on the front of the machine. There are a few places online that sell it, and who knows, someday Amazon will sell it.

They are a little expensive for what you actually get, but I wanted to stop fiddling around making my own 3rd brake light for my aftermarket rear tire carrier on my 97 Wrangler.  So I bought these thinking they would just fit right in. Well they don't.  The problem is that they are too deep and do not fit all the way into the lug holes.  They hit the back plate well before they are seated in the hole.  Maybe if they made the LED enclosure more shallow, it would fit.  Even with the plastic spacers they give you, it's not enough room.  I know the spacers are just meant so that you do not crush the wires when the spare is tightened down, but these lights are just too deep to fit into the holes correctly.  I guess it all depends on what kind of rims you have too and if they have deep lug holes.  Then I suppose these would work.  But for your basic Procomp steel wheel spare, these just don't fit right.  I guess I'm going to do like others said and maybe just hot glue them in there.  They are very bright for their size which I like. Probably the brightest 3rd brake light I've seen

I bought this to replace a burnt bulb in 2003 GMC Envoy.  This was a good choice and works well.  I wouldn't say it is any different than the existing bulbs in the car, but since it came in a pair, I replaced both bulbs.  I saved the extra working bulb as backup.  I would recommend this.  Great price $15 for a pair. I uploaded some photos for everyone to view.

I've only had it for a few weeks but I'm very happy with this bag; it's very sturdy and extremely well built, but it's fairly small (that's the only reason I've given it 4 stars)... I know there are larger Wolfman bags available, but they wouldn't have fit on my bike.  I can't speak to the durability of this bag because I've only had it for a few weeks and it's been garaged for most of the time.  The second photo shows the Wolfman spare fuel bag which I would also recommend.

I mounted these lights on brackets I fabricated for the K2 Backflip bedrack I bought previously for my F-150. The lights went on easily. If I had to find a fault with them it would be with the four Allen bolts used to adjust the aiming. Kinda of an overkill and makes aiming the lights a bit tedious.The lights are very sturdy and extremely bright ! In fact they overpower the high beams. I use these mostly on the class VI roads and to set goose decoys up before first light.We're not supposed to use these on paved roads but I live in a fairly remote area and we've already had heavy snow squalls and these lights really light up the dark roads ! I just keep an eye out for on coming traffic and shut them down so I don't blind oncoming drivers.They throw enough light out to light up the entire road at least a half mile ahead and illuminate reflective road signs even further out. I was going to add more but believe me, two are enough ! The current draw is so low they can be wired directly on a dedicated circuit without using a relay. Just be sure to run an in line fuse to be on the safe side. I used a 10 amp fuse and so far it had not blown.They've been through rain and snow without and water leakage and I'm not expecting any issues with them. I'd recommend these lights in a heartbeat !

Nice package, and very easy install.  Initial impression is that it's a pretty good quality, nice feeling rubber boot, stiff button.  This installed very nice and easy on my motorcycle with only a 3/8 drilled hole.  Really as easy as it gets for install.I did notice that the plastic ring in the bottom of the rubber boot that has the threads for screwing the boot over the button only has 1 thread on it. It would be nice if it had more threads than just once around the ring since the button side has lot of threads on it.  You could probably easily overtighten the rubber boot and strip it out, but I didn't have a problem with it.A nice little touch is that the rubber wraps around the bottom side of the plastic threaded ring, so when you tighten this down, the rubber grips on the panel you are mounting it too, which it seems will help prevent it from backing off in use.If this thing ages well, I might bump it up to 5 stars, and I definitely will use this again if I need another waterproof panel button.

This spring is listed as heavy duty, and believe me, it really is. I've had it now for about 2 months and still looks immaculate. My whip is a Browning BR-78 which is actually pretty heavy for a 5', and it still barely bobs on the highway. I like that it's not distracting, but keep in mind it absolutely will make it torque and stress your whip mount so be proactive; you might need a medium spring. Overall, it's pretty good.

Applied by hand, but that became too difficult for me for some reason, so applied with a DA and a microfiber finishing pad. Wiped up easy with a microfiber towel and I let it sit almost an hour to cure and it came up easy. It looks nice. Not sure about how long it will last but so far just when the car is touched the handprint doesnt seem to be leaving as heavy of a mark as they were before, I cant explain it really but it like evaporates almost, Which I seem to get really bad handprint fog marks. I planned on finishing it with a wax but it looks nice with just this on it, but Ill decide while I let it sit for at least 12 hours as it says. Ive never used a sealant before and I felt totally comfortable using this one. -update- car looks amazing in the sun. So happy!

The color of this product matched the brown interior of my Sierra Denali well.  It looks like it belongs there and is an original part of the truck.  It was easy to install and adds a lot of needed storage space.  This item should have a lid.  That would make it much more versatile.  I am not knocking it for not having one but DUHA should add this feature.  This appears to be rather expensive for what it is but it does meet my needs and is as good as advertised.

Not worth over $100. Luckily I got this on sale, still feel I over paid. Glue everywhere, hardware all just barely threaded on, hold open cable not long enough, broken welds, missing hardware, different threads on hardware that I do have.  Cup holders will probably break if i try to adjust them, will have to repaint it before installation, the padding is not denim, it's more of a rubbery vinyl plastic with single stitching. And to top it off, there is not a single lined up edge on this thing.

Moved to the northeast and needed something to clear snow of my truck.  I came out one morning to about 4" of snow covering my truck.  This made short work of pushing the snow off.  I have a truck bed cover and it worked great on it and every other surface.  It didn't leave any scratches and it felt sturdy while I was using it.  I read reviews about the adjustable handle version, so I went with this one.The non-collapsing handle does make for a bit of a bulky storage in the back seat, but you could remove the pole from the base.

Purchased this at the last minute for a road trip. I was skeptical about it because of the responses about it not being very durable in the rain so we wrapped our luggage in heavy duty trash bags and then placed them inside of the roof rack. Although we took the 1600 mile road trip and went through some heavy rains this roof rack stood up very well. I was very happy with this purchase. We will be purchasing a heavy duty hard case in the near future only for the aerodynamic features of it. The only con was at times we could feel/hear the wind hitting the roof rack. Otherwise it was all good!

I ordered these bulbs because it says it fits my Smart Fortwo.  My mistake was to trust the site and not physically check the bulbs size in my car, these bulbs are not close to being the size of what my cars needs.  Waste of my money.  I had to resale them to avoid refund/return etc...

This is a great product.  I used it to block sand all the panels of my 2000 Tundra Access Cab.  Whereas a spray can guide coat will not give even, thorough coverage, you can rub this onto every square inch of the panel.  A little goes a long way, so this tub will do several vehicles.  Be careful, though.  If you spill it, it makes quite a mess.  I kicked it over onto my concrete floor and cannot get the black stain out unless I use muriatic acid or something.

These seem really nice!  I powder coated my wheels in matte black and used these caps instead of buying new lug nuts.  They really came out nicely.  They fit quite snugly and I have no fear of losing any.  I keep the removal tool with my jack and spare for when I go in for tire rotations.  I'll remove the caps before going in so they don't mess them up.

Arrived days early (as in 3 days before the original scheduled delivery date).Large box, surprisingly light. I could hold it up in one hand.TIP: Watch the product installation video, it is that simple.Other than the zip together and put to bed side velcro strips on without removing the backing until its all lined up...I removed my tie down cleats from the corners of the bed.Fit the liner and aligned it. Set the bottom of the liner by removing the backing and sticking it down.Folded the sides down, and put the bolts loosely in their respective locations. Put the liner back up and used the bolts to guide me to cut the holes for the bolts to pass through.Affixed the sides, then bolted the cleats back on.Took about an hour, including the bed clean, dry, and alcohol wipe down.Looks great, feels as you would expect a grizzly bear to feel, nice and soft but tough. Just like real carpet.

For what it does, it's one of the best products I've ever used.Just don't expect instant results.  You will need to allow 1 a day or so, depending upon ambient conditions, to dry and cure.  So if you are planning on multiple coats, budget the time into the job.

Great product. Drove 800+ miles with the rocket box with zero issues. Increase in wind noise most noticeable when traveling over 70 mph but overall a lot less than what I expected.Easy to mount and built well. I was able to fit 4 folding camping chairs, Camping tent, Camp stove, 4 person tent, laterns, and a few small items. Possibly could have fit more if I would have put my tetris hat on.

These look great and arrived early! I will be ordering from spec d again. I ordered the clear corners. You will need to get an actual Amber bulb if you get the clear ones. Other than that installation was incredibly easy. Remove one screw and they slide right out! Would definitely recommend! Though the fact that these (being plastic lenses) are so white/clear makes the stock glass headlights look weird. I will be getting plastic lenses for mine.

So I've tested all manner of LED's over the past couple months and I have to say these are very bright. I replaced the current LED's I had in the Dome & Map lights and then Both Vanity lights and they are significantly brighter but these also have more LED's per bulb. The light it gives out is White and doesn't have any blue hue unlike a 6000k LED. Overall the build quality is decent, and the price was right for a 4-pack. In the pictures Iv'e uploaded you can see the Dome & map lights on in the first picture, then in the second photo the Dome, Map, and vanity lights are on, and finally in the third is a picture looking directly at all four (Keep in mind I took these photos in the pitch black, all light you see is from these LED's).Overall I would recommend these lights to anyone who wants to significantly brighten their cabin, however if you're looking for that cool blue hue like a 6000-6500k bulb look elsewhere, I'd say these are more like 4500-5000k. Also, longevity is yet to be seen.-Installed in a 2015 Hyundai Veloster

Fuel filter for a 04 GM 5.3L. Comes with a new clip. I attached some pictures of the filter. You will also need a fuel filter disconnect tool. See my review of the Lisle 35000 fuel filter disconnect.This is a little difficult to install and I highly recommend getting the tool. You will need to remove the old fuel line clip before installing the new filter. See attached picture.Once I got the old filter out, installing the new filter was no problem, it fit perfectly.

Love it! I actually mounted it behind my passenger seat to hold goggles (they always got scratched by other stuff in my saddlebags). It's annoying that they don't have any pictures of the back, so I'll try to post one but it's not that great. Basically there is a bracket in the middle and straps on the sides; I just used the straps & cinched them down good & tight.

Worked very well on a rock chip.  First application didn't penetrate completely but after adding a few more drops (per instructions) to applicator, the chip filled completely.  The tiny blemish that remained was so minor that I didn't bother applying any more resin to the surface as suggested in the last step of the instructions.

My item arrived with paint scratched off and box the busted wide open in two places!  I blame the manufacturer for not protecting the metal or placing anything inside the box to protect it.  You basically just get a big empty box with a large heavy item inside the will clank around for the duration of the shipping process!  UPS obviously was rough with it but the manufacturer is also to blame for packaging it so poorly.  Now I'm stuck wondering if this scratch will rust and if I should send it back and deal with this nightmare again.UPDATE: Now while I am waiting for the replacement to be shipped the price has dropped!  The same day they shipped out the replacement the price dropped $15 and Amazon will not honor the difference!  All major stores will honor the difference if it occurs within a few days and this drop happened before I even received the item.  They would rather waste shipping costs of me returning this item yet again than to provide great customer service.  This hitch is large and heavy and I'm sure it's not cheap for Amazon if I return it.  It would make more sense to honor the new price than to make me ship it back for no reason.  As far as the item itself: Be prepared for a product that is packed without any padding to prevent the metal from puncturing the box.  I wrote to Amazon to see if they could package the item better than the factory did so I could receive an undamaged item.  It didn't seem like they were willing to help me out there.  Pointed heavy metal needs to be wrapped in something so it doesn't just puncture through the too-big-box.  This whole transaction has been frustrating and would it kill them to give me the 15 dollars difference for having to wait for a new one to be shipped out and the frustration?  The product itself seems quality and I'm going to use the hitch to transport my mom's electric wheelchair.  It sucks having to wait longer for a replacement and also having to deal with Amazon's outsourced customer service whom could care less about me or my situation.  I really hope the one I receive is in perfect condition and packaged properly!

I purchased this Sewer Hose Kit in October of 2016 and installed it into my motor home. the installation was quick & easy. I did not have a chance to use it until today and found that the hose has tiny holes at several locations. Now I find that I cant return it as the return date has expired.  My advice to all that buy this product is to test it early on so that you won't experience the same frustration.  Design of this product is excellent but it comes up short on hose quality.

This is for a 52 inch light bar. See in the attached pic that I had to use stacks of washers and longer bolts to make it work. It bolts right on and looks good but if you have a 50" light bar don't buy this or be prepared to bend or purchase washers and longer bolts. I love the lower light brackets, they are great. Just wish I would have bought a 52 inch light bar first.

Despite the fact that I made CERTAIN to put in the correct information for all facets of the vehicle (year, make, model, engine and upstream vs downstream sensor) the site said this would fit our car but was WRONG.  The sensor I paid extra for 1 day shipping itself would have fit, but the wiring plug was male instead of female and therefore could not have a chance of connecting.This is actually the third time I've gotten an incorrect part that the Amazon part finder gave the green check mark.  In fact when I click on the link now it still says "This product fits this position on your 2004 Hyundai Tiburon: Upstream.  It also shows the correct Bosch 13565 O2 sensor for sale here: http://smile.amazon.com/Bosch-13565-Oxygen-Sensor-Fitment/dp/B000VASKWO/  as fitting my child's car, but the picture on the page SHOWS a sensor with both the wrong sensor and the wrong plug.  The correct Bosch part is below.  I had already started the rather tedious job (in 05 degree heat!) and could not wait another day for the correct part to come.  So I managed to sweet talk the local store to let me exchange what I had plus a small price difference for the correct part.  Amazon's price was nearly 40% lower than any of the local chain stores but getting the wrong part at a discount actually cost me more in both dollars and especially time.  Same for the other 2 times I ordered items that turned out to be the wrong part.  On one I wound up paying a shop twice for installing the same part (once to remove the leaking A/C condenser only to find the new one didn't fit and the next time to install correct one) and the other time I bought parts for a major engine job that would have to be removed anyway so I got them installed for no extra labor fee.  So when they told me I had the wrong oil filter, cap & rotor etc there was NO time to get them replaced by Amazon so I had to pay nearly 60% more at a local shop than the CORRECT part would have been on Amazon.  I've learned my lesson!  I will probably still try to save money on non emergency parts but I will use OTHER sites first to find correct part numbers.YMMVPicture with short tip & yellow lined female plug fit car and IS Bosch #13565 while the other is copied from the page above on Amazon.http://www.oreillyauto.com/site/c/detail/BOS0/13565/02205.oap?year=2004&make=Hyundai&model=Tiburon&vi=1425675&ck

It's a nice looking trunk.  The brackets that were included didn't work with my luggage rack, so I drilled new holes and used a grinder to reshape and modify it.  Also went to the hardware store and bought some brackets that are typically used to secure pipe to walls.  If someone really wants in they are going to get into it...however that seems true to most things not inside of a bank vault.

I purchased 2 of these to replace the 12 watt cargo lights in the bed of the truck.  These work exceptionally well for the price.  I would have given them 5 stars but the hardware that is used to mount the lights is silly.I can see the manufacturer wanted to create a trapnut effect with them but it does not work so well.  If they replaced the nylon locking nuts with serrated nuts the design would work the way it was intended to.  I found that jamming a screwdriver against the side of the nuts works fairly well while tightening these down.I was extremely skeptical/hesitant about buying these as I have never had success with any led lights (usually just junk that is dim and dies within a week).  I have to say thought that these suckers are bright and work very well for what I wanted them to.I will try and post a couple of pictures in the images area.I will report back if they die or rust.

Excellent tail lights. I have been looking to do some cosmetic upgrades for my Jeep and came across these while searching. I am a huge fan of the smoked out black look and these did not disappoint. These were a direct plug and play and only took me about 15 mins to install. I have the metal tail light protectors and these fit under them with no problem. Some people have complained about the brightness of the LEDs especially with the tail lights being smoked but I can't see what they're talking about. Plenty bright at night and during the day. I have put my car through a few washes since installing them and have had no issues with leaks or them not working afterwards. For the price you can't beat these lights. They are a huge upgrade from the factory tail lights and they just look awesome

These are very easy to install and work great so far.  The only complaint is that they are not as bright as you might think.  They are driving lights-not off road lights.  Off road lights are brighter. All and all they are nice lights.UPDATE 3-21-11  The chrome area behind the lens has a lot of rust.  These lights do not appear to be sealed allowing water to get in the light.  I would not recommend buying these until Warn fixes the leaking problems.

A little large for my Mercury Mountaineer, but keeps the tree debris and bird poop off the paint. Will have to wait a while to see how durable it is.UPDATE: After 15 months the cover has begun to leave a white powder residue all over the car while it is covered. When I pull the cover off, the stuff is everywhere. Some of it blows off, but to get it all, it has to be washed off. Very disappointing.

This is the second set of SpiderTrax I have put on a Jeep. The YJ has had them for over a year with NO issues. It is with complete confidence that I now put them on the JK. I have reviews and write ups on the 1995wrangler site and channel.What happens when you put 33" tires on 18" Sahara rims under the wheel wells of a 2007 Wrangler? We found out that they rubbed on the inside. Solutions? One buy new rims with the right spacing, or get spacers. I have heard plenty of pros and cons on spacers, most cons come from improper installs or cheep 4 for $80 junk. Spidertrax offers up some good spacers with plenty of good reviews. They are on the pricey side but you often pay for what you get. So if you are content to see some big round rubber thing rolling off your Jeep, then go ahead and get cheep, you might regret it. Me I will pay for a better American made spacer.After putting the Spidertrax on, the tires fit perfect. The stance is good and there is no rub. The tires are from Radar. Renegade R7 M/T 33 x 12.5 x 18" A good looking tread with an aggressive look. The sound is not over the top and makes less noise then the 33s on the YJ.I did have an issue with the wrong spacer getting shipped but that was quickly taken care of and the right one was shipped out fast.

Mixed reviews here with various results. Well my experience has been nothing but positive.I live out in the country (like prime same day means 2 day shipping when its sunny outside ). Not many AM/FM stations to choose from to begin with so I wasn't terribly concerned with reception.I WAS concerned with the factory antenna whipping into my cab roof when I hit the trail during hunting season. This short antenna solved that problem without issue.Installation: I needed to use an adapter bolt that was included with the antenna to find the right fit. I also needed to trim the rubber housing that slipped over the factory antenna to ensure a tight fit over the factory hole (see pictures for closeups).This antenna does NOT control GPS or XM radio (that is a different function and mounted to the roof). Im not sure about Bluetooth (I know if the factory amp is unplugged Bluetooth functionality is lost so that antenna might be in the factory amp).Overall this was a great purchase.

My favorite way to wax my 2007 corvette.  Use it like a detail spray and it always shines. Easy on and easy off.  Does not leave a white residue so I use it on plastic trim and window weatherstrips.Great on glass leaving it streak free.Highly recommend if you like a high gloss shine with minimal effort.

I have a tad bit over 30,000 on our 2014 Dodge Grand Caravan and it was time to replace the OE Mopar Filter. I came to Amazon (as always) to search for one and came across this one. What a HUGE difference in the quality of this Cleenaire Filter over the OE filter that came with our van. Look at the two pictures I attached and you can see the difference! I highly recommend this brand of cabin air filters to anyone who reads this. I will be purchasing one for our 2015 Jeep Cherokee when it needs to be replaced! Thank you Cleenaire for a MUCH BETTER filter at a FRACTION of the cost of the OEM!

Well, how do I put this... The LT Sport Window Visors will work and keep the rain off you with the windows cracked open, but they are cheap. They are not a GTS or the other brand names. I have installed a lot of window visors on a lot of cars. Install was easy, its a peal and stick so no real work is involved. Just clean the area where the tape is going to stick from wax and dirt. I had a set on my PT that were $60 and they fit better then the LT Sport. Also the higher end brands don't look bulky like the LT Sports. The picture for this add is a set on a Mustang. I'll add a picture on a PT Cruiser so you can see they look big on how they mount to the car. But all in all, they will do the job.

Say goodbye to Teflon tape! I quit using Teflon tape years ago after finding this. Just a little amount will do ya, so don't go overboard. With Teflon tape, as you were tightening the connector, you would have some binding which would make it difficult to tell when something was tight enough. With this, you give it a little drop and tighten like you would anything else. The cure time seems to be pretty good as well. I tend to not follow directions to the T and have used an air system after only a few minutes of applying this and haven't had an issue. The temperature range for this stuff is -65F to 400F. To the guy that used this stuff on his fireplace, I suggest you do a little research before giving a product 1 star for a use it was never intended for. Will definitely get more of this once I run out!

This hitch arrive very fast and I installed it my self the same day, probably took me about 1 1/2 since I'm very thorough. The trick to mounting was using a jack stand to support one side and on the other side lean it on top of the muffler, then just put the screws and torque to specs. I didn't even need to clean the threaded holes. I'll be using it to carry a bike rack, but in case something heavier need to hauled its ready now. As I was getting done and hanging the muffler back on, I saw the inner rubber hanger seemed like it wouldn't fit unless you remove the hitch again. What I did was remove the rubber hanger from the muffler and slide it through with the help of a flat head to push it, don't worry it would go in. Or just put the inner rubber hanger first before installing the hitch.

I'm a do it yourselfer with prior dealership experience but getting this thing in is a pain!  While there are several videos out showing the installation of this you'll notice that the part where its actually installed going around the window track portion is cut out of the video, the reason being is because its next to impossible to contort or turn the assembly in a way that allows the arm to set in the correct position with the space provided.  If you have additional money id take it to the dealer and pay the labor to have it installed.  It took me sessions (2 days) of getting this in correctly after getting so mad i felt like busting the window out so I decided to give it another day till I cooled off.  It's hard to see and hard to do,be forewarned.

Great fit and look. This is one thing that I can say was worth the price. Super tight fit that you feel when installing. Gives the car a different look while providing the carpet protection from dirt and liquids. I may buy another set in a different color just to see how they look in the car.

I put these on my 01 4Runner with  Moog 'tall' coil springs (81041) . The springs gave me an inch and after adding these spacers I gained another 2"s, they may settle some. I actually like how it rides better now with the spacer, not stiff or bouncy, just a nice smooth sporty ride. I have t4r bilstein 5100s front and rear, front is on second perch. Install was easy, I didn't disconnect the panhard bar as described in the instructions, just the lower shock bolt and sway bar endlinks.

This is bad stuff very greasy. Wish I did not waste my money on purchase. If you want leather conditioner but ziano. Not greasy and best product. BMW, Mercedes, Audi and many luxury car owners use this. You will know what I am taking about when you use it. Seats and car smells like new leather.

Like a lot of nerds and geeks, I like to put cool stickers on the covers of my PCs and tablets. I have the Hot Leathers Tribal Flame Skull sticker on two PCs, and people complement the stickers constantly. I've traveled with one of those PCs for 3 years, and the sticker looks brand new. I'm not sure what the intended use of this sticker was.  8)  But you should try it on electronics.

less work than I thought for a truck that is, cause you don't have to cut anything my trucks was H4 so I used theadapter for it (note: rubber goes inside the housing,metal adapter outside like it was the original bulb than the aluminum nut)I first marked in the garage door with tape at 10 feet away light distance, by doing that with this projectors ones I install emI only had to moved the passenger side up a little and you need to get a bixenon wire kit or it will not work believe me I trythat's why for stars

these look great in the grill of my jeep. only flaw was that one of the four strips had a broken solder joint. it was an easy fix and could very well have been a manufacturer oversight. it was an easy fix and not so bad to take any stars away from the seller.

Installation is super easy. It dose gives you a wider view specially right side blind spots, but it wasn't for me. I was looking for something that will help both sides, but when I turn it to the left side I was seeing myself. Also, it will take you some time to get used to it as the rear view vision as different from regular rear view mirror.

Updated... A week later and this unit says everything is maxing out a 1.14 amps. The issue is the unit itself is restricting the charge rate. If I check the charge rate on my phone via an app it maxes at 1.13-1.14 but once this unit is removed and the phone is directly connect to the charger, it goes to 1.7amps. So this unit was working good but only lasted a week.OriginalI love it. Works great and helped me figure out which cables were allowing the fastest charging rates.

They look OK, but the quality is not the best.  Every single one of my four door handles now "click" when the handle is pulled which is from the handle piece catching on the base piece.  I've only had them on for a few days, so maybe they will break in and stop clicking someday.  Every one of the 8 pieces has some sort of flaw / blemish on the finish (see attached pics), although thy are at or near the edges.  I don't think they will stay on my truck for too long because the mounting tape doesn't seem to hold very well.  I may have to rip them off and reapply with 3M tape.  For the price, I guess I'm satisfied, but I was expecting more.  And they saved me many hours... I was going to cover my door handles with carbon fiber vinyl wrap like I did on my bed rails, entire tailgate, mirrors, and grille.  So there's that...

The ithem fit the vehicle but it was not an exact match with the original. The original was made of rubber instead of plastic and it had the upper spring isolator built in the dust cover. We cut the old dust cover and used some of it to install the new one.

I bought these gloves in March 2016. I've used them several times a week since, and daily for a weeks vacation on the Hatfield Mccoy trail in West Virginia in June. I love them. I bought the size I wear in other gloves and they fit snug, but that's the way I want riding gloves. I haven't had any chafing or blistering, and they've held up fine. I like them so well, I've bought them for my son, as well as for several riding buddies. My son had a pair of fox racing bomber gloves that finally wore out, and other than the name, he likes these just as well. I highly recommend.

My rear O2 in my pickup has been throwing a code after upgrading to a high flow cat.  I ordered these to try simply because they were cheaper then actual sensor relocaters.  I ended up using both of the 2 supplied "Defilers" to move my sensor out of the gas stream as possible and because the style of O2 required me to do so.  I had to bore out one of the Defilers to a 1/2" diameter hole clear through so my larger diameter sensor would fit.  With a thinner diameter sensor this would not be necessary...  After reassembly and about 80 miles on her my CEL has not yet returned!  All in all I'm very pleased with this product and would recommend to anyone looking to do the same..  Just be prepared to do a little easy modifications depending on your O2 style...

Purchased from Amazon and came in the NTK/NGK box as shown.  Comes in a heat sealed bag with instructions.  Threads were coated with anti-seize and were protected by a plastic cover.  Has a crush gasket so no sealant needed.  Fits fine, works fine.  Takes a 7/8 inch O2 sensor socket.  I used an offset sensor socket from Harbor Freight.  Instructions say to install it finger tight then torque it to 26-33 ft lbs.  Made in Japan.  Uploaded a few pictures.Installed in an 08 Acura TL showing P0134 code.  I removed the cross bar to have a little more room to work on it.  It was easier to first remove the female connector from the metal support, then pinch it and separate the male connector.

This chains came at the right time just as we were getting more snow on a 15f week. I have a steep driveway that left a few 4x4 vehicles stranded in the past under similar conditions. This chains delivered!They come in a nice plastic case that can be stored in the truck, but I recommend putting one of them in a bag or have a separator between the set. The chains were tangled, and it took me a while to separate the two - not much fun doing it when it is so cold outside or in the dark. Once separated it was straight forward and they worked very well. Tip number 2 is to use work gloves because you could easily cut yourself especially when it is so cold and your kin is brittle. Last tip is to pay attention when driving off of the chains while removing them - make sure the cables don't get tangled in the back with the brake-lines. Overall - they already paid for themselves, and carrying them in the truck gives you peace of mind.

Problem is that you can't even see the color until you open the sealed bag and unwrap it.Anyway, I did order the same model in a different color and it fits perfectly. 1 star for the "beige" and 5 stars for fitment and quality.

One problem with this support struts is that both ends are the same size on both ends and on the vehicle (97 Ford Explorer) has a smaller pivot on the vehicle. So this does't provide a tight fit and can easily be pulled off without removing the clips. Plus in the installation process the clips on one of the strut just broke and I had to use the old ones to make it work. In process of submitting claim to supplier.

These pads were very disappointing for supposedly being a "premium" upgraded pad. Everything about them looks like they were made as cheaply as possible. And, worse, one pad wouldn't fit at all due to what looked like welding material in the corner of the tab that fits into the spring slip slides (see the pics). The others didn't want to slide freely in the calipers even with grease.The supposedly magic "thermo quiet coating" looks like cheap gloppy silver paint with a bunch of dirt in it. The plates are very poorly stamped compared to the OEM pads. The large bevels on the ends of the pads dramatically reduce the effect surface area of the pad for the first third or half its life. And the pad material itself was poorly cut and ragged. Some had black stains on the pad material that looked like grease. These were factory sealed in plastic and made in Mexico. I will never buy Wagner pads again. In reality these pads are probably cheaper for them to make then their cheaper ZD series as, unlike the ZD, they don't have any backing plates  (the Amazon pic is not accurate).

Easy install. Worked great. Installed on 2017 Jku.Took it on a road trip 2,000 miles. Loaded several hundred pounds, well on the way up. Was lighter coming home. Even took it offloading on a fee scenic trails, scraped a few times.Great hitch.Jeep guys, it fits fine with spare tire, however you can't open the tailgate. But I'm sure that is obviousWorks on a 4wheeler too, but the suspension is so soft it won't carry much.

This is a clear protector. I have had it on my bike for 6 months now and my tank is scratch free. The protector has not come loose or moved from where I originally installed it. Nor do I have to keep pushing it down to keep it stuck to the tank. I have uploaded pics to give an idea how it looks installed.

My original Tacoma front wheel driver-side mudflap tore off at 65 mph on a regular highway. It was just the wind that tore it off. I looked into what Tacoma mudflaps would cost from the Toyota dealership. Just one, (not a pair) was close to $95 (and that does not include the 3 per mudflap, plastic clips @ $2 a piece). I shopped around and found a universal pair of mudflaps for $17 at an auto parts store, but the modification to the mudflaps to make them fit (and they still probably would not look right) was a big turnoff, so I kept looking. I finally ran across these "Husky Liners Custom Fit Front Mudguards", Model 56931, on Amazon for $38 and ordered them. They fit perfectly,and I did not have to drill a single hole, they installed just like the originals. The hardware that comes with them does not work, due to my 2007 Tacoma having a plastic fender liner in addition to the mudflaps. But the original mudflap machine screws (three per mudflap) can be reused. The 3 plastic clips on the original mudflaps will probably be destroyed taking off the remnants of the old mudflap, so you will need to replace them (the Husky Mudguards only need two for each mudflap). I found identical replacement plastic clips on Amazon offered as "15 Toyota Mudguard & Panel Clips Camry Tundra 4-Runner", manufacture number 2947337 for $10. These were identical to the original clips for my 2007 Tacoma mudflaps. Since there are 15 there are enough plastic clips to replace all 4 mudflaps with extras to spare. So for $48, (1/4 the cost of buying the "genuine Toyota front mudflaps"), I was able to replace my original 2007 Tacoma front mudflaps, with an after-market product which looks better, is built better, looks a heck of a lot more durable, and fits just as well as the original.

Amazing upgrade from my old led bulbs, the bulbs DO have an adjustable beam angle unlike what the seller told me. The lights throw the light very far out and have the adujustable beam which gives a nice cutoff and projects the light evenly. Better than my previous 7200lm led lights and 35w HIDs which would scatter light everywhere. Tested on a Volvo S60 with reflector lamps.

These came out great! plenty bright enough and mounting was easy. The double sided tape is super strong and should hold up well, time will tell. I have a short box truck with a smaller tool box. I put 3 of the four on each side in the bed and the fourth inside the tool box. Very happy with the results and would buy again.I didn't use the supplied switch, but instead tied it into a custom switch panel with other switches purchased from amazon.

This is for the Group 24 box. Great product, seems to be sturdy, and the strap and strap-down brackets seem like a nice touch.In case you are worried about inner dimensions, it fit my 36R battery perfectly. So, here are the inner dimensions: Width: up to 7 3/16", Length: up to 10 3/8", Depth; 8 1/2", but keep in mind that the lid provides another 1 1/2" overhead room.Seems sturdy, and gives the extra spill and mechanical protection to the battery. My reason for buying this box is that I had an almost new car battery that I want to use in case of power outages to power my electronics. I realize that my battery is not a deep cycle one, but I don't plan on using it that heavily, so it will serve the purpose.So, this Group 24 box worked perfectly, despite my reservations about the inner dimensions.Seeing as I had my doubts, I figured I'll save the guesswork for other buyers.

Purchased this to "mod" out my Subaru Forester a bit.  I just wanted to plasti-dip the chrome surrounding my front grill and the letters on the back of the vehicle.  This did a great job.  Simple and easy to use, although make sure the nozzle is cleaned after each use, or you will not get an even spray when the plasti dip dries.  One note, though - after I ordered this from Amazon.com, I found a similar product at Lowe's for almost half the price ($5.99).

TL;DR - I hate this design... corrosion is an issue, I've tried to take some steps to prevent it. Pics attached are condition of old bulb/lenses, condition of old sockets, new sockets installed and working, and the stainless screws I picked up to replace the OEMs.So, these are the correct, OEM part to replace the ones that you are probably looking to replace... you know, the corroded, dirty, ugly, stupid ones that have been going bad from day 1 and have only gotten worse, because somehow Ford managed to use 4 poor quality screws that corrode like crazy and a design that somehow allows moisture to get up inside the 3rd brake light area and corrode not only the screws and the tangs that hold the actual bulbs in place, but inside the sockets on the wire harness that these big black plastic sockets plug into...Original problem:One bulb went out, was dirty, dealership saw it during and inspection, wanted to replace the socket and all.  Rather than spend the $50 deductible via her maintenance plan, I took the car home, scrubbed out most of the rust inside, and replaced the bulb.  Worked fine for a couple months.Attempted alternative solution:I noticed just recently that one of the bulbs was out again... so I ordered some LED replacements from Ebay that are supposed to replace the clear lens/bulb retention setup.  Well, the description there was wrong and they didn't fit the a 2012 Fusion.  During that attempt, I managed to break a clip on one of these sockets, trying to get it out.  I also noticed at that time that there was a bunch of corrosion inside the socket part of the wire harness that plugs into this.  And lastly, I went to pull one of the bulbs to replace it and the retaining tang/spring that holds the bulb in place just broke off completely, due to the rust.The fix so far with these parts:So, here I am... giving a review on the OEM part that fits correctly, works as designed, appears to have given me 2 license plate lights that now at least work, but has not solved the underlying moisture and corrosion problem.  When I took things apart, I had to use some light pressure on the outside of the wire harness socket with some pliers to break up the corrosion between the old bulb sockets and the wire harness socket.  There was a surprising amount of junk in there... hopefully that doesn't happen again.Upgrades:I have found some stainless steel screws for the clear lenses that work great! Phillips drive, pan head, #8 x 3/8" long, stainless steel sheet metal screws.  Found a 12-pack at my local Lowe's for a couple bucks. Only thing I can find on Amazon is this 100-pack...<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Hillman-Group-823256-Stainless-Steel-Pan-Head-Phillips-Sheet-Metal-Screw-8-Inch-x-3-8-Inch-100-Pack/dp/B000H5OBKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Hillman Group 823256 Stainless Steel Pan Head Phillips Sheet Metal Screw, 8-Inch x 3/8-Inch, 100-Pack</a>. That may stop the corrosion and browning issue at the lens. I also ordered some LED bulbs to replace the OEMs (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/GENSSI-36mm-LED-Bulbs-White-6000K-3423-3425-46413-6418-6423-6451-6461-6475-6476-6461-6486X/dp/B005FMGHOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">GENSSI 36mm LED Bulbs White 6000K 3423 3425 46413 6418 6423 6451 6461 6475 6476 6461 6486X</a>) which are WAY brighter...  As for the corrosion in side the socket/plug interface... I don't know what to do there.  I used a pick to get some dielectric grease on the pins of the socket, but I didn't see any corrosion there... it came from down inside the plug, where this socket's outer rim seats down into the harness plug. The only thing there that could be corroding would be the wires inside the connector.. So, I touched a little bit of dielectric grease around where the wires meet the grommets on the back side of the connector.  I was tempted to use some silicone, but felt that might have been too... permanent.  Anyway, hopefully I remember to come back here with an update on the stainless hardware and much later with a review on how things have worked out so far.

Really nice seat covers  they are above high grade material , the reason why i didn't give 5 stars is because the seats covers are not completely leather,Sides and back are cloth, and the zippers are only on back seat cover for 3, all the seats covers you connect bands with hooks! not zippers like the really pricey covers. But all in all i do like the covers and am happy with the purchase, way better than anything you would buy at local auto or Walmart store.

I bought these after the ones I had back in 2010 have failed on me. It was the same brand and I love them. There was one ballast that came defective but they sent me another one quick free of charge and I have to say I would highly recommend opt 7 to anyone. So far till this date it's working and I have not had a problem. I have 55W 5000K conversion on my low beams and Fog lights and they light up so well. Look for yourself and you can see how great they are. Used other brands but OPT7 is the best for me.

The knob itself looks great and feels good. It matches my interior very well and it looks how it should of left the factory in the first place(Eclipse 03).However, since the knob isn't threaded on to the shifter it relies on 3 hex screw around the neck of the shifter to support it, so over time it comes loose over and over again. I'm thinking about getting a threaded one, just how the OE is.

The turn signal pulsing in the video is not something detectable by your eye, just the camera.Hope this review helps for any/all of these products.  I'll review each one separately.

The instructions were not overly clear with the meaning of how the lights should be charging, floating and wired properly. My first go around I must have messed up with my wiring from the panels to the battery. So I took a voltage meter and started at the back checking both the amps and voltage at each step of the way.My two solar panels put out 140 watts which even being dirty were pumping out 6 to 7 amps and 19 volts today. After hooking up the control regulator properly it was monitoring the battery perfectly. I installed a LED power readout next to it so I don't have to get up and check it, I can look across my big-o 15' trailer and see it :) - I was throwing fans, radio, led lights (all of my trailer lights have led now) and watching it jump from a maintaining stage to 15 or so watts.LED Voltage Readout http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008KY5ULW?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s01

One of the lowest priced cooling system pressure testers available, yet very well made of good substantial materials.  The pump body is all metal - no cheap plastic.  Most of what you are paying for in the more expensive kits is all the adapters.  If you can use a standard "A" cap, then a simple model like this that doesn't come with a lot of adapters is all you need.  It works very well and is very easy to use.  You can also order from Stant any adapters you need.  Stant is a very well known name in cooling system components, and the quality of this tool shows why.

I recently purchased an Apple Watch with a stainless steel case. After a month of wearing it, I was deeply upset when I noticed scuffs and scratches, which is bound to happened (even with the amount of $ thrown in for the stainless steel case). I googled how to remove scratches on stainless steel and found a YouTube video that introduced me to this product, Mothers Mag & Aluminum Polish. I had high hopes that this would work. As soon as it arrived, I was ready to experiment. All you need is a microfiber cloth and a dab of the polish, and begin rubbing it into the area of scratches. I put on gloves so I didn't have the watch slip out of my hands and get the polish everywhere.  The polish starts to turn black because it means it's removing a very thin layer of the metal.  After a minute of rubbing out the scratches, I wipe it with a clean part of the cloth, and TA-DA! It worked!!!  I am very impressed by it.  I'm going to have this handy and use it to polish things around the house! A little goes a long way. I would definitely would buy this again and recommend it to others.  See my before & after photos.

I have a 2011 Tuxedo STX so naturally I needed to get the black tail lights. At $120 these are a steal, however the quality of the product reflects that.Mine have tiny imperfections including some scuffs, cracked underneath along the edge (photo attached), dust collected in between the lens, smudge marks underneath the lens etc.I was expecting a more quality product, but considering my original ones are scuffed up on the inside as well, it's a bit of a trade up.They arrived well packaged, fragile stickers on the outside, with instructions, sockets and bulbs.Update 5/18/16: 3 stars to 4I've since painted the edges of these taillights black and come to realize the cracks under the edge are actually glue and can be chipped off. However there are still scratches under the lens, but I did increase the rating by 1 star for being able to remove the glue. I've also added an image of the taillight with black painted edges.

Now I literally JUST got this tonight and haven't even installed the o2 into it nor it into the exhaust and it comes brand new...with rust!? Trust me, I ddoknt often right cramp reviews but this quality control is garbage. It looks like they had a returned item and just sent it straight to the next buyer. I guess I'll just clean it out but damn is that annoying. When I buy something supposedly brand new, I want brand new treatment. This interior being this way could cause my o2 sensor to fail alone just because of the gasses the heated rust could produce. I definitely will NOT be buying from this company again. How distasteful. Not to mention the threads are crap. Nowhere near as smooth as I had hoped.

This is the 3rd one of these covers Ive bought for my bikes. Its always kept them dry. I need a good cover as my bike is outside in the rain during the riding season. I ordered this for my 2012 Harley heritage softail classic (with large saddle bags, sissy bar and windshield) Cleaned my bike and covered it up just in time for 6 straight days of rain. I figured Id wait till the stretch of rain was over then see how the cover protected my bike. Well today I uncovered it and my bike looks just as clean as last week when I covered it. Not one single water spot! I ordered the XXL for my bike because of the bags and windshield and it covers it perfectly down to the ground covering the tires completely with still enough room under the center for the bike to breathe. Its a great cover, Im very happy with all my covers this brand and recommend it to anyone who has to leave their bike out in the rain.

Couldn't find exactly the hitch cover I wanted, so I bought this one and added a metallic emblem that had adhesive already on it. It looks way better than any hitch cover I've seen.

Just installed the new intake to my 2012 V6 Mustang this evening.  The Rota-molded parts are superb quality and fit literally like a custom-made glove.  In fact, all the parts are quality parts, including the screws and worm drive clips.  The installation took no more than 45 minutes to an hour and is just plain SIMPLE.As others have noted, the silicone hump hose coupling and intake pipe fit-up is tricky, but I found the easiest approach is to fit the coupling to the throttle body without the worm drive clip, then install the intake pipe in the cold air box and maneuver the pipe into the larger end of the coupling,  Then unscrew the worm drive clips fully to disconnect the plain end, open them up to form a U, position over the coupling, push the plain end back to engage with the screw and tighten.  Another precaution is to lay a cloth over the fresh air intake in the bottom of the box, in case you drop the screws when attaching the intake pipe to the cold air box from the inside.This is one of the best aftermarket designs I've fitted - truly factory option quality.  Once installed and after the ECU has adjusted to the new airflow after a short drive, the open throttle sound is awesome.  Highway cruising for 20 miles or so at 78 mph (God Bless Texas!), the average mpg was the same as before the new intake.  The noise level is the same as before for cruising, though when the accelerator kicks in on a hill to maintain speed, the intake will growl.  :-)I'll be looking out for the performance gains later, but for now, the sound alone is reason enough to turn off the sound system and just ENJOY!UPDATE:I noticed that the silicone hump hose coupling had a defect on its surface when I was installing it - it looked like a small piece had been cut out, but was a molding defect and would be unlikely to affect overall life of the part.  However, I emailed a photo to Airaid for their information.  Daniel replied quickly and sent a replacement which I received within a couple days - Great Service!

The TGA7351 Air Filter filter seems well made although I have some reservations as to it being an actual ToughGuard. As others have mentioned, it is not yellow, is not using a wire mesh screen, and does not appear to be pre-oiled as is described on the packaging and on the Fram website. The filter did arrive in a sealed factory box and the black filter frame is printed with FRAM TGA7351 Product of USA. (see pics).Is FRAM using bait and switch and using the Extra Guard filter at a premium price or have they changed the filter design without any mention to consumers or product packaging?

Broke the very first time I used it. :( Just get a damn bottle jack instead.I've had good luck with other Camco products, but not this one. :( I had a flat tire on my 21' EVO travel trailer and wanted to remove the tire in my own yard and just take the tire to the shop instead of lugging the entire trailer over. Well, this product did NOT make things any easier. It wouldn't lift the wheel high enough to change the tire. I put some blocks under it and then it simply broke in half. I ended up using the OEM jack from my truck to lift the trailer instead. I'm returning this and just getting a simple bottle jack instead.

I was very skeptical of all the reviews of this Purggo air freshener, so I bought a pair for my van and my car. Our vehicles smell better than ever, my wife is super happy that we're not using any chemicals to mask odors, and these things actually look cool in our interiors. 5 stars!

After installing on a tj this pushes the tire out from the vehicle which prohibits it making contact with the bump stops on the tailgate.  This is detrimental to the rear tailgate and will bend it. Plus there was substance all over upon removing from the box.

The reviews speak for themselves, as do the ratings. The light strip came with everything I needed to install it to the overhead hatch of my 2015 Crosstrek. Modifying the plastic cap took a few seconds on the hatch cover, pre-running a positive and negative wire from the original cargo light on the driver side rear quarter panel cover took minimal effort. The light is not easily diffused when you reach into the cargo area. The results, best cargo light money can buy on the cheap.

Yes - I'ts thick and seems high quality.  The (5) fastener sets were just zinc-plated, so I replaced them with some stainless pieces I had.Size-wise, the mounting bracket with the padded insert gripped around my tube bumper (3.025" exactly) with about ~1/2" between the flanges.  Not being able to tighten solidly, I used a locknut.

So I think the product as advertised has evolved over the time that it has been listed for sale on Amazon.  At the date of this review, I can tell you that this fuel door is not simply a slip over the OEM fuel sleeve/pocket item.  In fact, in addition to the fuel door, it includes a replacement sleeve/pocket that is an integral part of the product - you have to use it for a successful install of the fuel door.  There are videos available on Youtube that show how to remove the OEM sleeve by accessing through the left rear taillight, and it's a fairly easy and straightforward process.  Once this is removed, you pop in the replacement and attach the fuel door via the allen bolts.  In my case the replacement sleeve was a bit loose, so I drove a couple of self-tapping sheet metal screws through the collar of the sleeve into the fender to fasten it more securely (see attached pictures) - I would highly recommend doing this.  I should also mention that two of the allen bolts (at the 12 and 6 o'clock position) used to secure the fuel door to the sleeve are there for cosmetic purposes only, and do not function as fasteners.Fit and finish of this fuel door are acceptable for the price, and I consider it a nice addition to my Jeep.  No comment on the durability of the finish as of now, I'll update after a few months of weathering.

Used it for 2 chips. The first didn't not fill completely but I attribute that to first time user error.The second has completely disappeared.Both chips were smaller than a pencil eraser.I will buy again for small chips.The pics I shared are from after removing the suction cup delivery device. As many have stated before Do Not Overtighten the resin chamber.Good luck. Follow the instructions, take your time and it will work.

Chemical Guys make excellent products, I'm a fan of their waterless carwash. I have never used a rim guard or wax on my wheels, I find it easier to wash and wipe with the same items used to wash the car.The CG Wheel Guard product is a very soft goo type substance which has a nice scent, slightly softer than metal polish products out there like Mothers. Application is easy, during application, I saw some water spot marks showing, probably from old substrates that have sat on the wheel in the past, but once buffed off, they came off easily. However, I have a 3 piece wheel, the orange product got in tight spaces which was hard to reach. Which made extra work for me.The final product was nice, but not super shinny as described, maybe I need to work it in harder. I have uploaded a before and after picture, its really hard to tell which is was the final product  other than the less gunk.

My husband is an auto technician and has a different brand of portable car jump starter. He is always bragging about how handy his is for both work and home, and he has loaned it to other technicians in the shop who also rave about it. He has said many times he'd like to have a second one to keep at home, so I purchased the Ivation Mini Portable Car Jump Starter.It comes in a very nice carrying case with a thick foam padding to keep the pieces from being knocked around. I like the size and shape of the case because it fits nicely under my seat. The cables seem a little short to me, but my husband assures me this is not a problem. In fact, he likes this Ivation jump starter better than his that he bought off the tool truck. It has 2 USB ports to charge phones, tablets, etc. It also has a VERY bright flashlight that has a flashing mode and a steady light mode. There are blue lights on the sides to indicate how much charge is left in the battery. It has a rubber bottom to keep it from slipping off surfaces (I love that feature).My husband tested this device several different ways and found it to be a high quality device. He said in addition to charging dead car batteries, he likes to use portable jump starters to "bench test" things because it's easier to get to the part in question and to see what is going on. He did try to trade me this one for his, but in the end he decided he'd rather I have this nicer one to keep in our family car for emergencies.We are very happy with this Ivation jump starter, and I would recommend it.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I did not receive any other compensation, and I am not required to leave a positive review.

Absolutely junk, had this attached to my truck for 1 week after using it to tow my 7k lb travel trailer for a weekend trip. Now I cannot remove it! It's stuck and the key will not turn anymore. Should be fun trying to remove. Scratching my hitch all up on my brand new 2017 truck up using a pry bar trying to pop it off with no luck. Wish I could give negative stars!**update**I have since reached out to customer service and they did refund me my money, customer service was quick and professional to deal with.

I ordered the brown color one, was so pose to get it 2/5/2016, got a refund on 2/8/2016. Amazon customer service was A+. Saw they had the black with red stitching back in stock, so I ordered it. Came the next day. Yesterday 2/15/2016 I got the brown colored key fob I ordered on 2/5.Pros:-Cost-Protects key fob, and new "skin" for worn down buttons.-Strong clip to attach to belt loop, or other keys.Cons:-Not real leather, very stiff and waxy feel.-Key flip out button doesn't line up on black one. It's fine on the brown one. (see pictures)-Cant take off clip or loop at end.-Very think caseI wish it was real leather, would gladly pay more. Also wish they had a cut out on back displaying the VW logo.3/5 stars due to hole not lining up, and the stiff waxy texture. Price is fair, wouldn't pay more than $15. If it was real leather and fit better I would give it 5/5 and pay $30.

I've tried 2 different clear bumper trunk appliques/protectors/guards and they were all defective and not fit to size. This one isn't EXACTLY fit and hangs off of the edge of the bumper by a mm or 2, but it should be fine. The 3M tape should hold up fine. I just wish the guard was a bit longer overall to cover more of the bumper. The material itself seems real beefy though.

The GC004 10' extension Broke the first time I plugged it in.Update:  They were quick to send me a replacement.  The replacement is also extremely tight.  I have learned that I can make it work if I lubricate the connectors each week.Update:  I have abandoned this system by clipping off the ends and using another plug system from the auto parts store.  Now works great.

This was my first modification to my FG2. The install was easy and the crossover was addicting, but nonetheless, I ended up finding that it was just the placebo affect kicking in. In reality, one ends up losing HP and TQ throughout the entire power curve due to the fact that the intake literally sucks in hot air from the header. I had Flashpro, and my intake temps were higher than they were with stock. I eventually put the stock airbox back on and car ran better than before. Anyways, if you're truly looking for power, buy Flashpro, get a 3.5" intake (i.e. Hybrid Racing), and a tune, and enjoy cool temps and an actaul gain in performance!

4 of 6 worked great!! The remaining two however did not. The contacts on two of the panels had excess solder on the LEDs and thus was shorting them out which blew my jeeps fuses. From the looks of the plastic on the LED's someone from the factory tried to repair it too but only succeeded in burning/melting the plastic on the LED's. Terrible quality control and I do not recommend them.

5/26/16 UPDATE TO REVIEW:  I had the opportunity to put this to the test when my car battery was dead last week.  I fully charged this battery, but it failed to start my car.  After I attempted to use this, I used regular jumper cables to my boyfriend's car and it then started.  It still does work to charge small items like my cell phone, but it doesn't work for batteries - which was the reason I had ordered it. Due to this issue, I had to take off a couple stars.I purchased this vehicle car jumper because the other day I went out to my car because I had to be somewhere and my car was dead.  I had to wait for someone to come and jump my battery, which put me behind schedule.  The battery and cable come in a nice, heavy duty case.  It contains a manual and a charging cord. The charging cord has 3 heads on it so you can also charge your cell phone, tablet, or other items from the battery. The  car charging cables and clamps are compact in size and don't feel real super duty. They do feel like they would do what they are supposed to though.  I immediately charged the battery to full capacity and hooked up a phones to it. It did charge them fine and I had no issue.  I live in the desert and batteries do not last a very long time here, so I feel good about having this in my car as part of my emergency kit.I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased feedback. All opinions are my own, as I have not been compensated and I never guarantee a good review.

First of all, I purchased these headlights on a Sunday from an online auto parts retailer for just over $300 and I had to call them on Wednesday to find out they were never in stock to begin with and that it would be 2-4 weeks to ship!  So I asked them to cancel and refund my money (which I am still waiting for 3 days later) and ordered these on Amazon on Wednesday @ 3PM using Prime Shipping and they showed up the very next day at no charge!  Exactly why I use Amazon even though they were $356.My car is a 2005 Mazda 6 S 3.0 V6 which I have had since it was brand new.  My stock headlights had become so UV damaged that I couldn't even tell they were on at night.  Not to mention my car has always had a problem blowing the low-beam H1 55W bulbs on both driver's and passenger's sides.  I had probably gone through 12-14 bulbs in ten years.  The dealership told me they couldn't find any reason for the issue.....yeah right.So, I saw these and decided to give them a try.INSTALLATION____________Remove battery terminals, negative first, then positive.Remove front bumper including wheel well clips, bolts and the screws that hide in the wheel well close to the side marker lights.Unhook the side marker harnesses as the bumper starts to slide off.Remove the bolts holding the headlight in (two top, two bottom, one through the white plastic bracket on the side, and one plastic clip on top).Unhook the factory wiring harness by pressing down on the tap and carefully pulling the plug out.  Be careful as some cars with age will have brittle wires!Remove the black plastic frame on the bottom to re-use on the new headlight.Plug the new harness into the factory female end.There are two red and two black loose wires (that power the Halos) that you need to tap into your parking lights to operate.  I couldn't find which wires were the parking lights so I just tapped into the side marker harnesses since they are just hanging right there.  I put the reds from the halos to the green/black wire and the halo black wires to the black/red wire.Reinstall the headlight clips and bolts and the bumper but test the lights before by hooking the battery terminals back on and turning on the lights.Troubleshooting_______________Now when I plugged in the new harnesses, I ran into some issues.  The turn signal wasn't lighting up and inside the cab, the turn signal was blinking and clicking fast pointing towards a bad bulb.  That wasn't the case.  The headlight plug-n-play harness was not connected all the way.  I honestly had to take channel locks and squeeze them together and then I heard the last pins click together.After a test drive, the LED strip on the other headlight went out.  Same thing, the plug-n-play harness was loose so if I push them harder together, it lights up.  I think I will have to zip-tie the male and female harnesses to keep them firmly together.Will post pictures up soonUPDATE 9/25/15These headlights are doing great.  I did have to take them out one more time right after initial installation and take the harnesses apart.  I had to bend one of the pins slightly to make better connection on the car's end of the harness.  I also sprayed a little contact cleaner in there and haven't seen any problems yet.  I have gotten several compliments on them so far.

I love the look of the Raptor Lights and was very happy to see that these came out. I own a 2015 FX4 Sport XLT so I have the grill that is the pain to hook up. When i say pain you have to flip the brackets around and wire them to the drivers side and not over by the battery like every other grill so make a note of that, and in the directions it will tell you the color wire to tap into for the drivers side version.I had a problem using the stock clips to hook the bracket back so i used a bolt with washers and a nut to attach the light bar, I feel that this was a better idea anyway because now i don't have to worry about it ever coming loose.The light bar itself is very well made and all the wires are ran and attached to it so it makes for a easy install.

I really LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Meguiar's Synthetic X-Press Spray Wax paired up with Wolfgang Uber Rinseless Wash for quick weekly maintenance. In fact, I created my own hybrid of the two products.  I first made some Wolfgang Uber Waterless Wash by diluting 3oz of the concentrate with a gallon of water. Then I mixed 2 parts of my Wolfgang Uber Waterless Wash with 1 part Meg's X-Press Wax and...BANG!!!!  The absolute best detail and finishing spray I have ever used. And its infused with a maintaining sealant. I am simply amazed at the brilliant gloss and the super slick finish on the entire car.  My constant search for the perfect detail spray is over. Of course, using nice plush microfiber towels are  important.(Photos: Other than blurring the license plate, my photos are unaltered. No image processing to enhance photo. Also, the paint was not clay barred or polished, just a simple weekly spray down with this hybrid mix)

Bulbs are really bright. I received the right amount of bulbs as described. The only issue I found was that 2 blind out of eight where of a difference to color (blue tint instead of white). It looked weird having the two shades (see picture). I contacted the seller to see if I could exchange the two bluish ones, but it was not possible, and Amazon issued a refund instead. I really liked the bulbs!

Purchased this from 4WD.com (they price matched it here off Amazon and offered free shipping).  It seemed to be a very fancy, well built radiator.  My Jeep is my daily driver, I occasionally off road it, but had the extra cash around for this instead of another OEM one.  Despite the somewhat negative reviews regarding leaks and warranty replacements that cost $30 to ship a new one to you, I have opted to give it a shot.  Upon receiving the unit, one of the six rubber bushings were missing (designed to limit the chassis twist that places stress on the radiator, this was found to cause many core leak issues by Mishimoto, thus the inclusion of the rubber).  I called their tech support, the guy I spoke with said using them was optional, so I went ahead and installed the radiator without them....boy what a mistake.  Fast forward one year....The unit developed a leak in the lower pass. side where the core is welded to the housing as well as the proprietary cap that comes with the unit began to leak.  After speaking with another tech rep at Mishimoto, he recommended I try to bend the tabs back in on the cap as they were known to lose tension over time.  A year....cmon, for the price we pay this unit should be engineered to withstand purposeful abuse across the MOAB with little to no failure, and it couldn't handle a year of pavement daily driving.  I said screw their cap as bending the tabs back did nothing, after trial and error, I learned Mishimoto bases their radiators on the 05 WRX, so I picked up a locking cap for that car, install was tight but that fixed the leak....no dice on the lower leak.  I am currently going back and forth with their warranty dept in an attempt to waive the replacement costs.  For what I paid, I could have purchased three OEM radiators, not to mention the labor and cost of coolant replacement and time invested.  I have never, not once, when enacting a lifetime warranty issue on a product, been charged any fee for a replacement.  I feel a company should stand behind their product and write off the costs incurred for a potential lapse in manufacturing.  Furthermore, in that year of being installed, there was zero drop in temps noticed, nothing other than looking cool.  The concerns regarding mounting screws were also an issue, the stock bolts would not work, I had to play guessing game at Fastenal to find the proper hardware.  Again, for the trouble and price, all of these issues should at least be clearly explained, noted, and taken heed by their engineers.  If you design an aftermarket product that uses different hardware, provide the damn hardware, or explain this in a product description.  The same goes for the cap itself. I started off giving this a four star rating, but lowered it to three because....meh, after all the reviews, it's literally 50/50 on hoping the thing lasts longer than a year or two let alone provides any improvement.

Turn gas cap to the right till you hear a click. Then when you turn to the gas cap to the left it will spin and spin but will NOT open without the key (which is what you want it to do)  . Only use the key to unlock the cap. To unlock: put the key in and Turn the key to the left and then grip the cap and turn to left to take off. You don't need the key to lock the gas cap back on....just replace the cap and turn to the right till you again...hear a click.

The hardest part of my switch install was getting a rectangular hole in a piece of steel for the panel. I carefully marked out the rectangle so that it was centered and drilled 4 holes, one in each corner. Then used a cutoff wheel to cut out the remaining piece and filed the corners to shape. This product makes it so you only have to make one hole which saved a lot of time.

Ray Mills from Newnan Georgia. Very nice addition to my Ford F1-50 standard cab. These were exactly what I needed to help my wife get up into the truck. They mount easy and are made from very durable cast alluminum. You cant beat the price. I would recommend them for anyone looking for an economical cab step that is also very functional.

After fighting to put the high-pressure coupler on for about 10 minutes, I finally got it on to test pressures on both sides. Then the nightmare started, the high-pressure coupler got stuck. No matter how hard I tried, it just stuck. I got a plier and a pry bar, but the tools did not help at all. What made it worse, during the trying, the Freon just spurted out. I am afraid I lost all the Freon.I do not know how to take the coupler off.Update: All my freon on the high-end port discharged, and I had to cut the coupler off.I contacted the seller and I got my refund. For this reason, I changed to three stars. After all, every manufacturer may have some defective products.Update: I got a set of the couplers from eBay, so I can continue to use the gauge. I only put the high-side coupler on, SINCE i thought the low pressure-side coupler is good.  Except for the high-side coupler causing the freon sprout on my Ford Fusion, this thing also leaked all freon on my Camry, of which I only used the gauge to test the pressure. At the test point, the low side was 27 psi and high was 175 psi, and the car was ice cold. A week later, the Camry no longer put out cold air anymore. When I take off the gauges, both side ports had air bubbles out. I thought that was normal. Obviously, it is not normal. All freon on my Camry was also gone. In retrospect, there is nothing except the gauge that caused the problems. Thanks for this. I was out four freons.STAY AWAY FROM THIS THING. This thing caused both of my cars run out of freon.

Please see my edit at the bottom in regard to an issue matching two racks (driver and passenger side) when using the XADAPT8 kit with the Thule 598 Criterium bike rack.Works great. Super sturdy and easy to load a bike onto. Used the "XADAPT8 X Adapter Kit" mentioned below to get it to fit on my ROLA crossbars. Also had to install an Inno wind fairing to (nearly) eliminate the terrible whistling sound this bike rack created. I'll just copy and paste my review of the ROLA crossbars that I used on my 2012 Hyundai Accent SE hatchback in hopes that someone finds it helpful:I put ROLA 59707 crossbars on my 2012 Hyundai Accent SE hatchback with intentions of fitting a bike rack. Im quite happy with how it all turned out. I will break this review into three parts.1) ROLA crossbars by themselves:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ROLA-59707-Hyundai-Accent-5-Door-Hatchback-Cross-Bar/dp/B0062V2VIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ROLA 59707  Hyundai Accent 5-Door Hatchback Cross Bar</a>&nbsp;With no bike rack or wind fairing installed, the ROLA crossbars do have a slight wind humming sound. I am a very particular person and did not find this very bothersome. It is not a whistle, just a minimal wind hum that isn't that loud or annoying. Skip near the end for a summary of the ROLA bars themselves.2) ROLA crossbars + Thule 598 Criterium bicycle roof rack:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Thule-598-Criterium-Upright-Rooftop-Bicycle-Carrier/dp/B000GT70DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thule 598 Criterium Upright Rooftop Bicycle Carrier</a>&nbsp;Because of the larger size and shape of these ROLA crossbars compared to Thule crossbars, the Thule bike rack does not fit onto the crossbars with the hardware thats included. The U-shaped clamp of the Thule bike rack is too small to fit around the crossbars. Therefore, you will have to buy the "Thule XADAPT8 X Adapter Kit"&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Thule-XADAPT8-X-Adapter-8/dp/B001PQU51C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thule XADAPT8 X Adapter 8</a>. This allows the Thule bike rack to be mounted within the channels that run along the top of the ROLA crossbars. It's easier than it sounds to put all this together. Just make sure you buy that adapter kit and you'll be set (except for an issue with matching two racks; skip to the bottom EDIT regarding that). As far as wind noise with the Thule bike rack installed *without* a wind fairing, it's bad. Really bad. There is an incredibly loud whistle, which is *mostly* fixed by putting on a wind fairing. See the next paragraph.3) ROLA crossbars + Thule 598 Criterium bicycle roof rack + Inno Wind Faring (size medium / 40 inches):&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Inno-Fairing/dp/B002WZ8NC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Inno Fairing</a>&nbsp;This is the last thing you'll need if you're putting a Thule or other brand bike rack on these ROLA crossbars. It nearly totally eliminated that annoying whistle and there is for the most part no wind noise coming from the roof now. It almost always sounds just like it did before any of this was installed (most of the time, that is; unfortunately, there is an occasional whistle depending on the wind direction, etc - have only noticed it a couple of times in the last week of driving). It did install fairly easily and the sticker does come off with a little effort.Overall, these ROLA crossbars are fantastic. Installation was extremely fast and easy. Screwing in the supplied bolts was a total breeze (not sure why some reviewers had trouble). Once installed, they feel really sturdy. I would definitely recommend them along with the other products I mentioned.EDIT #1: The Thule bike rack install on the drivers side (after installing the Thule bike rack on the passengers side a few days ago) was really annoying and didn't match the passenger side exactly in terms of looks because I am using crossbars other than Thule brand along with the XADAPT8 kit (the XADAPT8 kit converts a U-shaped bracket that comes with the Thule 598 bike rack and hugs around your crossbar into something else that slides into the top channel of the crossbar instead). On the Thule 598 bike rack, the big plastic bracket thing with the gray round knob on it would have mounted with an overhang towards the windshield, while the passenger side overhangs towards the trunk side of the crossbar. I did manage to modify the driver's side Thule 598 bike rack with some effort and ingenuity so that they did actually match (not fun at all) and both overhang towards the trunk. But regardless, this is something you should be aware of if you are required to use the XADAPT8 kit. I think even some Thule crossbars require the XADAPT8 kit, so just because you have Thule brand crossbars, don't think you're in the clear.IN SUMMARY OF THIS ISSUE: If you are lucky enough to just have square Thule crossbars, you can have two bike racks installed and it appears to me that they will match perfectly with no modifications. If you use the XADAPT8 kit, having two Thule 598 Criterium bike racks mounted will not perfectly match each other unless you permanently modify one of the racks, or another option would be to mount one bike rack facing the back of the car. But that also doesnt match and doesnt really solve anything.EDIT #2: My whole setup does have a very faint whistle depending on what the wind is doing. I will try some things to totally eliminate it, but at this point it is pretty dang quiet and for some reason doesnt always occur and is intermittent depending on how you're driving and what the wind is doing. The fairing did help immensely though, but unfortunately didn't 100% fix the whistle/wind noise.

This is a decent little set with the Ford logo on it. It comes at less then half the price of a Leatherman multi-tool alone, so expecting it to be at that level will bring disappointment. But for occasional like in your Ford Ranger glove compartment, this is an excellent set to have. The knife is sharp and pretty sturdy. A little oil on the hinge helps it open, but I still couldn't get it to open with one hand (too tight). The multi-tool has a great assortment of tools / blades on it. It's easy to use and folds down nicely.This set makes a great addition to the glove box of my Ford Ranger. It will make a great gift for any Ford owner / Lover.Notes:- Great price- Pretty good value for the price- Ford Logo looks great- Nice for occasional use

I have a bunch of power banks but I always forget to recharge them and end up with a dead phone. I purchased this solar charger because I work in construction and I'm always out in the field, this solar charger allows me to charge my devices at all times. This solar charger has 4 very nice solar panels making it very efficient, it's capable of charging up to 2 devices at the same time. I use 10 ft long charging cables to keep my phone out of the sun when charging it. This solar charger has a magnetic latch that automatically keeps the charger closed and the solar panels protected. This solar charger comes with 4 carabiner and a micro USB cord.

Perfect fit for my 2007 Cadillac Escalade. I had a plunger type noise from the front of truck when driving on uneven roads, and the front struts where leaking. replaced with these, saved me big dollars from the dealer. Appear to be the exact same with the exception of the color. Check with your dealer first to insure this is the correct part number. There are many variations for this strut that physically appear similar.

The front mats are a perfect fit as are the third row. The second row, however, falls short. I realize that they designed then to allow the seats to slide but in doing so they left a lot of area uncovered. Even my stock mats covered some of the track area where these so not. They also have a tendency to curl up where they meet the back door causing a tripping hazard and not providing great protection.

Lots of poor reviews on these, but I couldn't find anything local that would fit.Some stores would have the front, but no back to match, or it would be the wrong style and wouldn't fit.Plus, the full sets they carried were $50 and up.I finally decided to take a chance on these and I'm glad I did.They fit great, and they look great.For reference, I put these in a 2017 Accord.There are two latches under the rear seat that you can pull out to lift the base of the seat and strap the covers underneath.Just pay attention to the tags on the seat covers that tell you what goes where, and take your time to install them correctly, and they should be fine. The headrest covers are a bit large, and don't look as good, but I didn't expect a totally custom fit in this price range.The seat covers are a bit thin, and aren't going to protect much in a machete attack, but that's not what I got them for.After installing the covers, I sprayed them down with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Scotchgard-Auto-Fabric-Carpet-Protector-1-Can-10-Ounce/dp/B001NPD7BK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Scotchgard Auto Fabric & Carpet Protector, 1 Can, 10-Ounce</a>

Being full time RVers for 10 years now, we have tried several tank products. The one thing we have always struggled with is the smell when dumping our tank or when our tank is close to needing dumped. In the listing, the company says that there will be no embarrassing odors when dumping... I honestly doubted this... A LOT. To my surprise though, when we dumped there was no embarrassing smell... If you are even an occasional RVer, you know the smell I am referring to!Happy Campers Organic RV Tank Treatment was also very easy to use. I simply followed the instructions per the listing when first using. I held my toilet pedal down lightly and filled the bowl then added 2 scoops(first time only) and stirred it around with my toilet brush to mix... Then flushed. This makes total sense to me that the product needs mixed with water to work well.Since I had to use a double dose on the initial treatment, I decided to give it a second try with the regular amount of treatment. Again this product excelled. No smell 6 days after when needing dumped and no smell for the neighbors when dumping.I am a huge fan of the fact that we are finally using an organic product that actually works! We have tried several different organic products but always went back to the chemical laden products because they worked. This product however; not only works but works better than any other product we have tried in 10 years.Another BIG perk to this product for me is that a little bit goes a long way! It comes in a canister about the same size as the box for the product I used to use but has 18 treatments instead of the 8 in the other container. This being said, it takes up less space in our trailer and lasts longer! A definite win-win!Lastly, if you are like me and not a fan of the blue residue other chemicals leave in your tank and around the seal, you will love this product. It is a white powder and leaves no bright residue!We will be using Happy Campers for years to come!**I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I however; tested the product not once but twice and my opinions are 100% my own.

Great bag for the price! It's nice and sturdy, zipper seals great. Plenty of length in the straps, comes with extra straps as well. Has velcro dividers inside that are removable or adjustable. Also has a clip latch inside to hold stuff down inside the bag. Also a small clip to place your keys. Only complaint is the straps are extremely long. You have about 3 feet left over on each strap. It would have been perfect if the back up straps wear shorter for the tail.

My review is based on ease of install and appearance since I haven't driven with them installed yet. I only installed mine using the screw holes provided with the factory rock guards, so I still need to drill the holes for the other screws. Everything lined up nicely and they look pretty good. It comes with clear vinyl to protect the paint surface whod is nice, since I heard some complain of scratched paint. I think they look pretty good and so far Im happy with them for the price.

Do not buy this inner tube! The stem connection to the tire is very very flimsy and I found that it rips at this joint when you try to pump up the tire. I have attached a picture of this inner tube above the one that it was supposed to replace because of a hole. After I installed this Kenda inner tube and tried to pump it up, the stem broke at the joint between the valve stem and the inner tube. Note the very poor joint - it looks like it was joined with a thin patch or maybe some kind of vulcanizing glue or paint. Note that the unfortunate tube with a hole has a very strong joint - there is a buttress in the tube and a strong connection to the stem. The Kenda tube is very very poorly constructed! Don't be sorry that you purchased it like I was...

Got a new used 2017 F150, and I'd overlooked a nasty ding right by the tailgate handle. I didn't really work on the dent too much as I didn't want to remove the tailgate handle and all that, so I aluminum epoxied the inside to keep it from expanding, then painted it for extra protection. Very pleased with the results; the dent/crack is still there (paint isn't going to fix that), but it's not nearly as noticeable, and it's protected.  Color seems to match perfectly. I'm glad to have it around for any chips I find in the future.Included before/after pictures to show the match. Don't let the shading/reflections from the bump fool you; it's a perfect match.  Oh and I didn't find much use for the pen; the brush is the way to go.

I bought 3 sets of these lights for my son's Jeep. The lights look good on the roof rack and are nice and bright. So I also replaced my side lights with these on my Durango. They work good. I dealt with the company on a small issue and they resolved it very quickly. They made it easy to deal with them and very caring.  I'm so pleased with the lights and the company, I will deal with them on all my lights I plan on getting. I would highly recommend the lights.

I bought this a little less than a year ago and it worked great until I opened it this morning to check it. The battery was still charged at about 75% but then I noticed a huge space under the light. If you look carefully it looks as though the battery is swelling up. As much as I liked this product it seems as though I have to replace it. Going to try and get on to NOCO with regard to my warranty.I promised an updated review and here it is. Customer service is awesome. After posting my issues I was contacted and after following some instructions the jump starter was replaced at absolutely no cost to me. It's been about 6 months since I got the replacement and I have absolutely no complaints. Great product, great service. Highly recommended!

It runs very true to the advertised i.d. and the clamps are top notch, the fit is firm and reliable. Shipping was fast and each pod came with a pair of UNI decals to boot. Would recommend to anyone looking for top-notch filtering when going with an airbox delete.

This light appeared to be good quality at first, and the LEDs are bright, but the mounts are completely worthless. They look to be some type of die-cast fragile pot metal and they have no strength at all. One literally sheared off in my hand before I even had a chance to install the light. I will try to fab up some better mounting brackets myself and see if I can still use the light bar

I ordered this for accessing the 6" deep spark plug wells on an 2013 (B8) Audi A4 allroad / 2.0L TFSI engine.Finish is not polished as shown in the Amazon photo; it's a matte finish that likes to collect grease and oil. Overall happy with the tool particularly due to the difficulty I was having with a standard spark plug sockets with the rubber insert, and their tendency to stay attached to the spark plug when I pull on the drive extension.Lastly, the 3/8" square socket is either poorly machined or is of such a tight tolerance that my go-to ratchet doesn't fit, and my others are very tight. That's not to say the drive on my ratchet isn't perfect, but I've never experienced this tight a fit with any other socket.

I'm used to prying stuff with a flat head resulting in either crazy scratches or flat out breaking things. These are so useful. Can't believe it took me so long to buy it. It's good quality and has many different molds so you can choose which tool is appropriate. I pulled out my instrument cluster the other day to do a led swap and left no scratches. I also did led swaps on a few other things and it's all using these. Completely satisfied and would highly highly recommend. If you want to keep your interior looking fresh this is a must own. I'm about to pull out my headlights tomorrow and use one of the tools from this kit to assist so I don't break the plastic retaining clips and scratch my paint.

Installed on my 2013 Raptor.  I love the clean in-channel look.  I had to modify the install a bit as my windows kept auto-rolling down thinking there was something in the channel.  AVS recommends you install these u-channel brackets.  I had to take one of the two off and once I did that, the window has been rolling up just fine.

13 April 2018Works as advertised.This is mounted beneath the floor of the bedroom in our RV and I can barely hear the fan when the fan does turn on.I use this to keep two Group 27 Deep Cycle batteries charged and topped off.We live in our RV full time, so having 12 volts all the time is a big deal and this converter works to keep us powered up.Bigger is not always better.  I downsized from a 55 amp converter to this 45 amp because my GenSet is only 2,500 watts and we do not boondock very much at all.  But, when we do boondock I wanted a converter that was better sized to work with the GenSet and properly charge the batteries.  This converter works as it should and it works well with the size of GenSet I have.

I ordered this cool bumper from Amazon warehouse at small discount I guess someone returned this unit but in working order. The cool thing is that this hitch bumper has a LED stop light on back of it just for an extra security keeping the drivers behind me little more alert. The installation normally would be very straight forward, but in my case my wiring was all rusted so some modification was necessary. As for the Hitch Bumper itself, it looks and works great. It allows me to stand on it in case I need to put luggage on the roof of my car etc. The hitch in my Rav4 is 1 1/4" but the hitch came with a very nice looking hard plastic sleeve to accommodate the 2" hitches which I had to have on my car.  It's just makes the whole gadget little more complete. I was able to cut the sleeve to fit onto the hitch itself making the appearance little thicker and more sturdy. One problem though I had was with the led lights. The LED lights streap was little loose and the top part of the led light had a small gap possibly allowing the water eventually to get in. This is where I had to use little silicone paste to get this clogged up just in case. Still 5 stars as I got thi thing at little discount. Overall good looking unit making the old Rav4 look little better. Definitely good buy so far.

What was delivered was not what was pictured but the part numbers matched the picture.  What was delivered were 2 piece push rivet style clips and they were not only wrong but most of them looked broken because they were made out of hard cheap plastic.  Do not buy these if you are trying to replace the panel clips for your doors, they won't work and you will have to return them or eat the $4 for about $0.12 worth of plastic garbage.

Fits the Predator 212 cc as shown in the photos. Cover was removed in second photo to show pulley arrangement.  It's true, no instructions were included and the product would be easier to assemble with washer, spacer, pulley etc, sequence for mounting on crankshaft if a simple drawing was furnished.  Bolt sizes needed for mounting this on a Predator 212cc are (4) 5/16-24 x 1.0 inch plus (1) 5/16-24 x 2.5 inch for the crankshaft.  If you plan to install the plastic cover, it will be necessary to cut chain opening.  A straight cut blade on a multi-function vibrating tool will work best for cutting this plastic.

Updated Review: Item is as described: fits my jeep without any modifications and installs easily! I love the look and the attitude it gives my JK. We have installed 2 6 inch KC Hi Lights on the top. We have installed a 24" LED bar on the underside, it had adjustable brackets (which we beefed up  a little) so they actually fit into the same holes as the KC's and we just put longer bolts in! I just recently put on the graphics so this is a "almost completed" attitude adjustment to my original.

Very bright. Perfectly adjustable. Great shipping time. No leaks so far. I reccommend adding some blue loctite to the threads if you off-road.Update*So great I had to buy another. The one attached to the bull bar is two years old and works like new. I added another behind the grille. Very satisfied.

Fit well. Will take two people to set it in place. Even when using C-clamps to hold when mounting, having another person for a standoff visual and support would be of the greatest asset. Other than this, after installation it looks great! I did not paint it and had many complements of the flat black. But, too each is their own.

Very nice OEM replacement for a 2004 Ford F350 SD XL trim truck's missing bumper provision. I chose this one with the non-fog light provision because my truck did not have fog lights originally. I had to buy some bolts, nuts and washers to get this onto the bumper face which I also bought here on Amazon, Part #F01002365. I looked at the truck with no valance on at first and it sure looked funny. Placed this on and it looks nicer as from the factory. I seen other vehicles' parked very close or on top of curbs or vehicle stops in parking spaces and their plastic valances torn or broken or missing. I avoid that when I can. Would buy again if need be.

I have bought front bars for two of my grandparents jeeps. (2014 4 door, and a 2016 2 door) I was very satisfied with those. They were simple enough, and despite us dropping either a bolt, or a driver down the front panels... They are sturdy, and tough.However, this year for my grandmothers birthday after she had mentioned many times the difficulties of getting in and out of the back of her 4 dr jeep, I decided to purchase rear bars as well. I an very dissatisfied with the fact that while they are made very nice, they rub against the frame that the door hinge is on. (See photo)Unfotionately I am not sure if they will like this, but we will wait and see. Our shipping times for all 3 orders have been VERY timely, and I was very satisfied with that. The front ones came with instructions while the rear did not. (And shouldnt have too!)Hope this helps searching buyers. These rear ones are as sturdy as the front, and work as intended.Grandson of some Jeep Enthusiasts.

Great alternative to the OEM headlights.  These are LED and they provide a modern look to an older vehicle.  They also provide a better quality  of light.  The light color is 6000k which is a bright white.  The only reason this is a 4 star is because the adapters did not fit the OEM harness and would not clamp in.  Otherwise this is a great buy and would recommend to all Wrangler owners!

Although the concept is great, the item is a REPACKAGED 'garage door bottom'. I found the EXACT SAME "lip" at Lowe's for $13.50 for 16ft of it. The SAME double sided 3M tape for $5-10 depending on length (I decided to go with drilled holes and snap clips instead ... less messier, much more durable).So essentially, I bought MORE of this "lip" for a FRACTION of the price at Lowe's. This company is a scam, they just buy the garage door bottoms for $10-15, stick some cruddy 3M tape on it, and turn it around to sell it to customers at **5** TIMES THE PRICE!!I don't mind the whole repackaging idea with slight modifications so it is now usable for cars... its the fact that they have the AUDACITY to flip it around for a tremendous profit when the exact same material they repackage is so easily available to everyone if only they opened their eyes and looked at any home improvement store.

I purchased these seat  covers in Aug 2016 and it's now April 2017 but I'd say the real problems started in the fall not just a few months after I paid top dollar for cheap garbage.My initial complaint when unboxing is what a jaw dropping pink these seats covers are. I have other red trim pieces in my Jeep and one in particular is the Red Mesh Roof Cover. These seats in comparison are anything but red. I went to a popular social media page to complain along with the picture attached here and was told this:"Our red will match other things that we sell are red. It will not necessarily match reds from other companies. That being said the red will change a bit over time."I decided to trust their statement because it's all I could do at this point. I didn't want to take those things back off again but I regret my decision to be lazy. I didn't show them my Rugged Ridge Red Mesh Top in comparison so I couldn't hold that statement against them, but for giggles I included a picture of their Mesh Top here for your eyes to see. The statement that they'll "darken over time" made me curious as to why. Sweat maybe? Gross.  You would think that the UV rays would lighten the seats not darken them but still I listened and followed the orders.Seat covers are expensive and especially these ones. I've seen similar covers including rear covers made by a reputable company for the same price but I figured these would be good quality and worth the $200+ price for just front covers.After about 3 months I developed a tear on the stitching at the left leg seat area. It's been about 7-8 months with my even lighter Pink Seat covers and it's not just disappointing that the company made such a product and I spent so much but it's made me view the company differently now. It's embarrassing to have them on anymore because I'm tired of going to events around hundreds of Jeeps having people say, "nice pink seats!", "are those seat covers for a cause?", "did you have those pink seats made?".  One season is enough so regardless the outcome I'm taking them off for this year. I'm not sure how long they'd last anyhow with a rip in the stitching. I'll attempt a warranty claim but I doubt they'll do anything which is a shame because not only am I finished with RR products but when the opportunity arises at the huge events I'm usually asked about my seats and nothing positive comes out of my mouth.Let's see how the warranty claim goes.

Great light pair, more of a spot led fogs then flood but still does the trick. just installed them and (sealed the lenses with additional sillicone to prevent fogging). haven't tested them/ridden in wet weather but hopefully they'll hold up. SUPER BRIGHT compared to my standard halogen bulbs and definitely a reasonable price.----------------------------------UPDATE: Had to buy an aftermarket set of off road led light brackets because the one included has the strength of a paper clip :)

I just got around to hooking this light bar on my 2013 RZR900.  It is mounted to the bumper I purchased from Rocky Mountain ATV.  I must say, WOW it really lights up the path in front of you.  I purchased this one because it was the only one with this style and option on the side mount. It fit in the bumper like it was meant for it.  They work just  fine.  It you do buy this light get the below attached wiring harness.  You will want 14 awg wire.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WHQOLSM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3.

I really like these are a a solid metal definitely aluminum.  They give a cool aggressive look to the Jeep doors. Look at my pictures. They are easy to install, but I have a suggestion. They fit just right, and if you don't hold them right, they will go in crooked. What I did was hold the side closest to the push button that opens the door, so it feels lined up with the edge and then screwed the opposite, farthest away from the push button first. That seemed to work really well. The only thing I did not like is the screws are silver, so they stand out on a black door handles with this being black as well. I am going to be careful and paint the screws in place black since I already installed them I use enamel for this since it should match the gloss color of these. I would like to acknowledge that I received this product to test for free or at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. This does not influence my opinion about the product or its quality. I really do try to give you a fair and honest review from a person who is just your average guy.  I will answer any questions that I have learned about the product.

These are good bars, but right off the bat, know there are a couple of limitations:1.  If you have a vista / moon roof the bars have to be widened (see below for how to do this).  Because of this the weight capacity of the front bar is reduced by 50%, so you can only safely hold 45 Lbs.2. You have to use supplied thumb screws for the front rail instead of the supplied flat head screws.  This just means someone could possibly unscrew and take your front bar (but it would take some effort)3. The bars have a wing design which looks great but does obscure the view out of the vista roof a little.  Brightlines has taken this into account and recommends moving the front bar to the back when not in use.Other than these issues, they are good bars.  Look great and you can't beat the price.  If your looking to carry a lot of weight you might consider one of the OEM options.Installation note:  If you have to widen the bars for installation take a screw driver and gently pry up the panel on the bottom of the passenger side mount (see picture).  Then loosen the two screws inside.  Bolt the cross bars to the rails.  Then tighten the two screws and reinstall the panel.  Don't worry, there is plenty of room to do this without scratching the roof.

This is an awesome "SUN" shade...  it' mesh.  When you put it on, attached the back first, then the sides, then the front.  The front needs to be yanked a bit, as it's a very snug fit so it doesn't flap around.  I like it alot.

Terrible, just terrible!  Plastic is so flimsy that any pressure at all folds over the blade.  Even worse, they're not even as tough as a fingernail!  If you push your fingernail into the blade, it leaves a very clean indent!  You'd have better results with dried chewing gum -- it's harder and stiffer than these blades!  Not useful for anything, going to return these immediately.

I have a 2017 Ford Focus and the last thing I want to do is drill the bumpers or start cutting.  Mount is made of cheaper lighter aluminum but considering it mounts to the license plate bracket, that's a good thing.

Rock solid hockey puck lock that protects my shed out back.  With a hasp that has hidden screws, this lock does the trick.  Hasp is something you have to buy separate at the hardware store and know what you are getting.Rear opening dimensions are approx 1 3/4" by 3/4" as you can see by the tape measure.I added the 2 photos for the purpose of answering a question for someone on the size of the lock body opening.  The lock looks "pitted" but allow me to clarify what that is.  I have placed a good amount of motor oil on the lock (and in the lock mechanism to make sure it will not freeze in the winter).  The lock protects a "cabinet" or "hutch" that must be outside year round in Connecticut.  Therefore what you see is a mixture of the coating of oil which I applied on purpose and some dirt and dust.  Not a defect in materials.

Using my Bosch SP0f000049 Temp Gage for a Transmission Temp Gage.Got it mounted today. Checked the Gage with my laser thermometer and was about 1-5 degrees off at various temperatures. Pretty much accurate. Used a GlowShift Universal Single Gauge Swivel Pod  to mount it on the left top of my Wrangler dash. Gage fits well and easy wiring except for the light. Haven't found where to hook up to my dimmer wire.  I used Anderson Metals Brass Pipe Fitting, Barstock Tee, 3/8" x 3/8" x 3/8" Female Pipe  and 2 of Anderson Metals 57001 Brass Hose Fitting, Adapter, 3/8" Barb x 3/8" NPT Male Pipe. The Gage kit comes with several Brass adapters. I used the 3/8 adapter to screw the sensor into.  Tapped into the 3/8 rubber hose on the trans output  line. Unit MUST be grounded for the Gage to work. In the photo you can see the Blue electrical ground eye, 14-16 Gage under the sensor with a 3/8 washer to take up the slack for tightening. Grounded it to the frame.I Would do it again

Edit:  Huge props to the seller here.  They truly do stand behind their product.  They expressed a replacement roll out to me direct from China, and put a very nice letter in the box with it, all without even being asked.  Actively seeking the best possible customer service is something few companies do, especially on mass-marketing sites like Amazon.  I will happily buy from them again knowing that they actually do support their products.  For the price, the product is good and the service can't be beat.I found two major issues with this exhaust wrap.First, the included zip ties are junk. Throw them away, don't even bother trying to use them, they don't actually hold tight.Second, my "50 foot" roll was actually two separate pieces that were poorly stitched together.  There was a good foot long piece that was two separate pieces overlapped, and it was completely unusable.  Annoyingly enough, this also rendered several feet useless after cutting out this section.Frankly, i wouldn't buy this again.  it's worth spending the extra few dollars to get the real DEI Titanium heat wrap, this wrap isn't horrible, but the execution is crap.

More poor fitting, cheaply made trash courtesy of Dorman. I dug my old overflow from the trash and spent two days cleaning it up. The Dorman bottle is of extremely poor quality in comparison. The Dorman did not even fit properly, so there is the old tank back in the truck. I spent more labor than a tank is worth, but with a piece of Dorman as my only other option, I spent the time cleaning the old tank. Dorman sucks so bad, I hope there is a special place in hell reserved for the owners.

Perfect fit for my generator, I bought it for my Champion 3500 generator. It's lit it was made for it. Very sturdy, after I mounted it to the rear of my 5th wheel trailer, I got up on it and stood on the platform and even bounced my weight, (I weigh 205 pounds). Works great to cable lock the generator down I purchased the steel version.

Super heavy duty and are much larger than pictures.  Fit perfect on my trailer.Edit:  I put these on my trailer deck; they have been out in the weather since I purchased these three months ago. It is now October and wear the ring connects to the bolt; the ring is rusting and corroding pretty badly. Although this is a nice product, I'm going to have to deduct two stores for the corrosion and poor finish. I really had high hopes for this.

Love this sunshade! My boyfriend especially is amazed at the quality and strength of this product. I did a lot of research after I had an issue finding a universal fit sunshade that would fit my 2012 Honda Civics long windshield and finally gave up and ordered this custom one. Very happy! My only disappointment with it is at no fault of the company, but in shipping the shade was damaged a little and has bent/crease marks in the middle of some of the panels. Again, no fault of the product itself, just poor shipping. It won't affect performance of the product at all. Just aesthetically it bothers me a tad. Especially since I paid $56+!Performance-wise it keeps my Civic 5-15 degrees cooler at least. Its extremely hot where I live in So Cal so theres only so much that can be done. But my Civics giant windshield was turning my car into a microwave! Ill probably have the windows UV tinted in the future, but for now this really helps a lot!Its easy enough to set up. This sunshade is built very sturdy so it does invade the space/surprise a passenger if theres one in the car while you attempt to open it and put it in its place. Almost everyone makes a comment. LolAnother note- the sunshield I recieved is a 1 peice instead of a 2 peice unlike most other reviews on here which pleasantly surprised me. 2 separate peices sounded like an extra hassle. Not sure why or how this happened, but I am ok with it!Overall, very happy with this product and would recommend. I love the Ice Blue color I received and I know Ill get many many years of use from this quality product. Thanks for reading!

The bottom line is the cans come with a directional fan nozzle like most of the Dupli-Color paints do. It was very easy to spray without runs, almost as easy as spraying a primer. The can product page and can says the formula can be top coated with either acrylic lacquer or urethane enamel so just an all-around great product. works with both I've always loved HOK paints but never wanted to spend all of the money required for the proper equipment, then the cost of the paint and associated chemicals required to go along with that all topped off by wasting money trying to lean how mix and spray it correctly. Then comes along this wonderful magic of pre-mixed 12 cans of HOK paint! Now of course if I painted every day on lots of projects or did it as a job paying around $45 for a 12 ounce can of paint would be crazy but for a few small projects that I have planned like the subwoofer enclosures already done and the new engine cover waiting it's turn, the cost of these cans against the cost all of the equipment, materials and training required to use the quarts or gallons is more than worth it. Sorry that I don't have pictures on the subwoofers out after painting them but I was in a time crunch to get the all of the wiring and AMP install but I'll attach the as purchased pictures, sanded down to fiberglass and the installed painted product. I'll try to get a couple of pictures of the out of the car and in the sun for a better look and add those later. I highly recommend this product.

Perfect fit for 2017 RXR 1000. No door adjustments needed. Hardest part was attaching trim and finding right size star socket to remove bolts. Instructions were clear and had pictures. Probably 45 minutes total.

Im very excited with the V7 Its an outstanding detail sealant wax and its been great after a car wash. It really makes the vehicle look like you just spent a few hours coating it with jet seal. The funny thing I used jet seal and Chemical guys Lava more than a month ago and since them Ive used nothing but V7 spray sealant. I strongly recommend this product just remember a little goes a long way. A clean Micro fiber towel helps make the detailing easy.

Just what I needed!!  Installed these great handlebars in about 2-3 hours with the help of my buddy.  We both have NEVER done this sort of DIY project before although we normally do smaller changes to our bikes with no problem.  These bars fit perfectly!  I ride a 15' XL1200C, all the cables were the perfect length except for the front brake which was just a tad tight.  Normally when the bike is straight and/or in motion there is slack on the line but parked the line is kinda tight (ordered new cables/lines).  Great look and even better comfort!  I am 5'11 and with my Mustang seat it is literally the perfect height.  Love theses mini-apes without the over-sized fists in the air look.  Got a few compliments the other day at a Harley Summer Event.

I received my plow in a box just this past weekend. I was immediately disappointed in the condition of the box. Unfortunately I was not there when it was delivered and the end of it was open the box itself was pretty beat up. I however decided to go ahead and open it up anyway. As I examined and accounted for all of the parts I had noticed some damage to the plow pieces. Now, I get it. It's a plow and it will get damaged anyway. My concern is more about premature rusting. I'm not sure how or when it got scratched, I just know I am not happy about it but considering It's almost $400 I feel I have the right to complain and warn others. I needed this and didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it I will just deal with it and offer this review. As far as putting the unit together it wasn't too difficult at all. I did use a medium loctite on it which I would recommend anyone who purchases this unit do as the blade comes in sections. I had bought this for a 99 Honda Recon 250. I'm on Ohio and have pretty mild winters and plan on using this to clear my drive as well as my neighbors. So essentially, light duty. Below are the pics of the damage right out of the box.

Look great and a snap to install. Remove the two plastic pop rivets. Push the center pin upwards and remove the pin from the top. Pull the remaining rivet down. Use some muscle to get in-between (separate) the finished fender and the subframe underneath to both remove the factory lamp and replace with the new LED unit. Plug and play.

installed in my 03 civic just fine. Was an easy install. The ONLY thing is i couldn't use both pipes BEcause it wouldnt fit in my engine and i didn't have  time to cut a pipe.  But i see a difference, it adds hp and makes car louder. Sounds good with my exhaust, ill post a pic of this product installed. I think it is worth the 50 bucks haha if you don't want to waste 200 bucks on some stupid brand name like AEM. Thanks

Does not fit as well as the OEM visor but looks good, and with some setting of the helmet plates I could achieve a fit good enough so there's no hissing noises at speed.Edit: Just tested one aspect I was very unsure about this visor; the strength of plastic used. I was doing a good 70 on the freeway when a small rocks hit me right in the face. The visor didn't break (no cracks, just a chip at the impact zone). Good surprise, would definitively buy again.

Excellent and easy way to improve the feel and look of your bike. They do help minimize vibration, being dual density, but be real there will always be vibration. I did have to dock a star because they were listed as open-ended grips, but were in fact closed (nothing that an x-acto knife couldn't solve). Overall, a cheap upgrade from stock grips, and the vibrant color definitely accents my bike!

A friend and I installed this in an hour. No special tools are needed outside of a torque wrench. High quality parts, nice finish and everything lined up perfectly. No drilling or cutting, just simple nuts and bolts to get it all together.Makes a huge difference in body roll when cornering, especially when loaded with people and gear.The packaging was complete and very sturdy - and it arrived in two days !!

This is a no Brainer!!! I bought a 2006 CRF 100f for my  Son about six months ago the motor was locked up and I about factory parts to Rebuild it with.  The piston was froze up in the cylinder.  I had to bore out the cylinder by hand with a cheap three blade hone.  Simply because I couldn't find anyone to hone that small of a cylinder for me.  being cast iron that took a good while to accomplish. the bike run pretty good and had a good compression.  The bike run good for about six months and the cylinder started to egg still had very good compression and run very good just started to smoke.  I spent about $300 on the factory parts to rebuild the engine to .025 over. I should have went the BBR kit to begin with. This kit was so easy I should've went this route to begin with not to mention the amount of power it did add to the bike. Don't  get it confused it didn't turn it into some monster racing machine that a 10 year-old cannot ride any longer.  But there is a noticeable power gain. It took us about 4 hrs to install.  But that is in a shop that is set up to do that. It is a mediocre task if you're not familiar with engines and how they work.  All I can say is do not waste your time on boring cylinders that smoke by this Kit and be done with it. Seller shipped right away as well.

These OxGord Caps fit my 2001 Lincoln Navigator OE wheels perfectly. The originals had all finally broken a year or so ago and I needed all four replacements. Glad I found these. They look great and where individually well packed for shipping.Installation Tip: I've read several reviews that say they don't stay on or they fall off a couple miles down the road. It's because they're not being installed correctly. You can't "pop" these on with the palm of your hand. You need to use a rubber mallet, line them up correctly and give them several pretty solid whacks (just like the originals needed) to get them to snap on and seat around the lug nuts properly. You can't be gentle with these, you have to whack'um pretty hard. Once they're on properly they're very tight and they're not coming off with out a big screwdriver/pry bar.

Wanted brighter lights for my 2007 Dodge Nitro and took a shot a this lights as they were inexpensive and looked cool. When I first go them saw extra wires, I wasn't sure but I plug them in and to my surprise they didn't work. I was so disappointed and was about to return them, but something told me there was more to them as I had some extra wires just hanging and I figured they had to connect to something. After some research online and watching some videos on Youtube I found out that this lights needed some ballast in order for them to work, went back to Amazon and found some that were exactly for this lights. Once the ballast were in it was easy plug and play and there's no way you can get it wrong. Turned lights on and by what a difference in comparison to the yellow stock lights, these were way brighter and give it a nice look to it as well. Driving at night makes a big difference and I have better and further viability. I'm so happy with them that I'm now searching to get some for my girlfriends Toyota Solara. Remember these are great lights but you'll need to order ballast for them to work.

Overall this is a nice quality steering wheel cover for the price.  I get eczema on my hands pretty frequently due to skin sensitivities to synthetic materials like latex, and often notice that I suffer from contact dermatitis with most steering wheel covers.  About 30 minutes after driving, my fingers and palms will typically itch uncontrollably and washing them afterwards often makes it worse.  Finding a genuine leather cover that does not need to be "stitched" on has been challenging for me; I have been through at least 4 so-called "leather" covers over the last year or so.  I was skeptical about this one being 100% authentic leather, and the odor that has permeated my car still leaves me questioning it, but so far my hands have not been dry and itchy after using this wheel cover for about a week so it must in fact be leather -  perhaps not the finest quality leather, but still some form of genuine leather.  My entire car smells of PU leather though, so I am unsure as to why it smells so strongly like a synthetic; perhaps it was treated with something that polyurethane is often treated with.  Nevertheless, smell aside I am pleased with the fit (ordered a small for my Lexus IS 250 and it fits like a glove) and the red stitching is a bonus as it matches the interior and stitching on my stock steering wheel (which is a bit too smooth & thin for my liking.)  I also like the finger grips at the top and bottom of the wheel cover as opposed to the sides since I typically drive with a hand on the top or bottom of the wheel, never at 10 and 2 which is usually where the grips are located on these covers.  I deducted one star for the odor, but otherwise am pleased with this cover.  As a note, I left the cover in my garage for a week before putting it on my wheel in hopes that the smell would lessen, and I guess it did -- a little -- but it has been in my car for a week now at least and the smell is just as strong.  If anyone (manufacturer/seller?) has tips on how to make the smell go away, I'm all eyes & ears.

With the proper prep and technique this is a wonderful product. If you're nervous about hurting your paint, study up and go slow. Paint correction takes patience and preparation. I've had nothing but wonderful results, albeit with a beer break or two.Photo shows one pass with this product with a cheap polisher, below the stripe is the before. This was on a 16 year old civic.

I have been looking for a way to keep my hands warm on my DRZ-400S. I have heated grips, but they don't help my fingertips. I bought and tried about five types of winter motorcycle gloves, and they were ok down to about 45F, but not at 28F. My very good Marmot (non motorcycle) gloves with the heated grips and with polyester glove liners added were usable at 28F for up to 30 minutes at highway speeds, but my fingertips were still too cold after 15 minutes. Adding chemical heat packs did not help, and they are not armored.Electrically-heated glove inserts did work - but when I combine them with my heated-grips, my heated-vest, and my LED driving lights, my bike was depleting the battery as I was driving, and that is unsustainable. I put in a 35 watt HID headlight and a 5 watt LED tail-light to reduce power, but it was still a net loss. I looked for a way to be warmer with less power, and these mitts work. They look as dumb as a dog with one of those cones on its head, but not being cold and being able to wear thinner gloves with more dexterity is worth it. I used trauma shears to cut mirror holes, and cauterized the cutout with a solder iron.

These are great replacements, and look fantastic.  They were super easy to install-  just line them up on the wheel, and give 'em a good, centered thump.  They hold in place VERY tightly, and do not shift or wiggle.The color is a near perfect match, and appears to be just a slight bit lighter than my factory 16" 4wd wheels (which need to be cleaned).  I changed out all 4 caps at the same time, so there is no issue with the wheels matching each other.  The difference is actually unnoticable unless you are very close and stare, and I only know because I'm the one who installed them.  The black backgrounds and silver logos are done well, without color bleeding or rough edges.Great product!  I only wish that I had hadn't have waited so long to buy themLike you, I base my purchase decisions on the actual experiences of others.

The most difficult part was perhaps getting the wrap on the steering wheel. I spent around 30 mins just to get it to fit the wheel.I'm taking a star off because the two needles were too thick and it was quite difficult to get them through holes.The whole thing took me about 4 hours. I'm happy with the end result.

I have used Moog products for years and bought other Moog parts from Amazon with no issues. However - I had a similar experience as George (posted 2/9/17)... Knowing I had to press the pivot shaft into the new bushing, I did so without even checking the fit. Now the pivot shaft turns inside the bushing and I can turn/pull pivot shaft out of bushing by hand. This should not be so. Idk if suddenly I got super strong or I got a bushing that is out of tolerance. The shaft absolutely should not come out by hand after I press it in. What gives??? Ordering another pair, but I cant get the ones Amazon sent me out without wrecking them... Time for Amazon customer service to step up. I will update re next pair when they arrive. I have also contacted Moog regarding this problem.UPDATE - I got two more pair - one pair from Amazon and another pair from local supplier. This is where it gets interesting. The other supplier were Duralast from AutoZone and I got one bushing that was ~ 0.806" and the other was 0.810". They were also distinctly different from each other in the way they were made...  One was identical to the "bad" ones I got from Moog and the other (which had the correct I.D. -  ~ 0.806" ) was different that any of the Moog. The replacement Moog bushings I got today from Amazon were both 0.806 - 0.808" (which is ok for the 0.810" dia pivot shaft to PRESS into it and not come out or turn by hand). The replacement "good" Moog ones had a yellow dot mark on the rubber and a stamped number on the side of the outer sleeve, as opposed to the "bad" Moog bushings that had white dot on them. Both had identical packaging. I will try to upload the pics of all the side by side comparisons I made. Once I got a "good" pair, everything went together and stayed together like it should.In summary - measure the I.D. with a micrometer and if you get 0.810", (which was the O.D of my lower control arm pivot shaft) the shaft will likely turn and pull out by hand and it WILL WEAR your pivot shaft and likely require you will have to repeat the whole job again sooner than you'd want or you will have a weird clunk or alignment issues. If you don't have a micrometer - try pushing the pivot shaft into bushing by hand It should NOT go in by hand or its no good. Not cool. Just glad I caught it and with my 25+ yrs of doing cars determined I was dealing with a manufacturing quality prob.. I should get paid for figuring this out, and I am sure I am not the only one that had this prob. I have also contacted MOOG and my other supplier re this problem.  Only one star because though AMAZON did send me two more, only one got here and I lost 2 more days waiting for two more that measured ok. Customer service was helpful, but AMAZON really put me in a bind on this one. Cost me way more that the $11 per bushing price in lost time.

I was very excited to try this item. Especially right now during the winter months I also have a circulation problem so my hands and feet are frozen all the time.  This was definitely a perfect item for me.  It came packaged very well. There were no bends in the cover.  It is a little bit of a hassle to put on your steering wheel but that's just because for me it was a tight fit which is what I wanted. Once I had the wheel on it looked really good.  I also had it charged and ready to go. I also like that you can charge it in your car because I would not want to have to take this in the house every day. It works great and kept my hands warm and was very comfortable.  It has a decent charge time. This week will be the first week I will have used it every day which will give me a better timeframe of how long the charge lasts This is a great idea especially for people that have very cold hands. It is a luxury item that is super cool and is exactly as described.I got this free or at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased feedback

For the price, these work pretty well. I really just needed something to fill a large hole in the bumper before a show. I cut the top lip smooth and put a 120mm halo ring around it.  There are 4 places on the back of the housing you can drill for screw holes. Then using some SS screws and fabricated aluminum brackets I was able to get these where I wanted them.

Will save your behind on tip overs, looks and fits great. You can hardly tell that they're on the bike. Just remember that the length of these are mainly made to protect your bike from drunk people tipping your bike over vs in a high speed crash. If you're not gonna race your bike at high speeds, these are a good choice. Easy install also.

Ok. Where should I start.Lets look at description on Amazon:  1)  Patented one-click I/M readiness key provides quick state emissions readiness checks and drive cycle verification- there is no such a key.  2)  Retrieves generic, manufacturer-specific and pending codes as well as vehicle information (VIN, CIN, CVN)-VIN?! - you wish! I connected it to Toyota Sienna and all this Autel 619 could show is Calibration ID. As for  2000 Honda CR-V, Autel gave me a message on screen: "This mode is not supported"  3)  Turns off check engine lights, clears codes and resets monitors-it might. I just did not have any DTC  4)  Compact unit is portable, so you can take it almost anywhere- not relevant  Even reads, records and plays back live sensor data- yes, but in Freeze Frame it shows data from O2 readings (Bank1, Sensor 2) for 2000 Honda CR-V which I previously hooked up Autel to, before I connected it to Toyota Sienna. Why is these Test Value in Freeze Frame menu? - God's only know why.Did it read SRS data?- YesDid it read ABS?- No! It did not neither for 2000 Honda CRV nor 2000 Toyota SiennaThere was not even choice in menu to select ABS to test. Device has only one icon ABS/SRS, but after reading data, it shows only SRS results, there is no other options to choose.It could read O2 sensors data on 2000 Honda CRV, and it could not check Banks on 2000 Toyota Sienna (the message says that it does not support this mode)It reads System status on both my cars.What really I did not like is that Autel 619 does not have these 3 LEDs on front panel that would show you if your vehicle going to pass smog check. Of course, you can go to ODBII menu, select System Status, then scroll down and see if all sensors passed the test, but this is sort of annoying.In too words Autel619, in my opinion does the same job as Autel MaxiScan MS300, which cost 15 bucks or so, except SRS reading.I might be mistaken. But it was a big disappointment that it can't read Japanese cars ABS and all O2 sensor values.I went through registration on Autel web site. There was note, that "Updates are available" for 619, but it was only a note. I could not find any update on this web site for this model. I tried to open New Issue under my Autel account. For my even bigger surprise they don't have a Model of Sienna in their Model list. I mean.. WTF?! I was able to update vehicle data base through PC suit, not a web site (the instructions was on CD). This time when I tested ABS/SRS on 2000 Honda CR-V, the ABS option popped up in menu. But guess what after 2-3 minutes of communication of this Autel with Honda, I got a message on screen: "Tester is not communicating with control unit, check the cables, check if battery fully charged" I just installed brand new Interstate battery (a day ago), ignition was on cables connected. I tried any possible options in their menu. The result was the same. I guess the upgrade was a joke.BTW, the Autel 619 does not have neither built in nor compartment for batteries. Somehow its setting was flushed and next day when I connected it to the vehicle I had to go and turn off this beeper again.I realy not sure if it worth the money. Besides SRS testing the rest is not that impotent. Autel MaxiScan would do the same job. Live reading is not helpful unless you have your own garage and can disassemble the engine. So, for average person who can do simple job the Autel MaxiScan would probably do the same job as Autel 619.Anyway, I shared my experience and what you might expect from this code reader.

Like any other Jeep crazy person, I wasted countless hours searching for a front bumper. What drew me to this bumper was; the overall usefulness and quality built this bumper provided. I have 23 years of off-roading experience and have been in some crazy situations. This bumper allows you tackle most of that. The biggest safety factor is the max D rings that allow you to put the trail Jack in without movement. I like the protection with the tubes that stick out by the wheel wells over Gen2 XRC. I like how it pushes the brush and small trees down. It gives you the protection of the wheels and housing, but allows the the tires to push the mud out and not get stuck behind most full size bumpers and cuts down on the weight. The winch plate allows you to install multiple different types of winches and gives you the protection of the winch, by sitting down into the bumper.Shipping:My bumper only took three days to receive in standard UPS shipping. I happen to be home when the UPS driver delivered the package. It was in a well packed 7 foot box that weighted 150lbs. The delivery guy and myself had a heck of a time getting it into my house.The weld points and the overall build of the bumper was phenomenal. It had a great finish to the metal. It came with plenty of pre-built brackets installing off-road lights.Install:You must have two people to install this bumper, just from the weight to the over-all size of the bumper. Taking the stock bumper was a pain, no room to get your hands in to take the bolts off. You definitely need some good articulating wrenches and sockets. Once you get the stock bumper off, you are left with the frame mounts. My bolt holes from my 2015 JKU frame mounts, did not line up. I had to drill out the holes to three quarters of an inch large, from the quarter inch standard holes. I literally had to take my bumper off and on eight or nine times. To get the bolts to line up with the holes. The fog lights, I recommend installing on the bumper first which was very easy.  3 hours to install.For the price of this bumper and quality I guarantee you won't find a better bumper!

These are the nicest terminals I've ever seen and they are very handy. It's super easy to add a circuit, the terminal comes with 4 holes for wire and setscrews in each to secure the wire.I bought these for my solar panel setup in my cargo trailer. I went all out and bought a good battery, so I wanted to buy good terminals, as well. Then the whole thing looked so pretty, I had to make a window when I enclosed it, :). These terminals are high quality and they look as good in real life as they do in the pictures!

Difficult install?  I honestly can't figure out what everyone is crying about.  I managed to install these side steps BY MYSELF in about an hour, with hand tools, and they look awesome!  Paper instructions are for sissies and guys named "Teddy", do a YouTube search for Smittybilt SRC and you'll find everything you need. Will the paint peel off in a month?  Will they start rusting out in just a few weeks?  Only time will tell, but they are certainly heavy and solid enough.  The key to installing them on your own is jack stands. Jack stands... It's not rocket surgery.  Seriously?! "Teddy"?!  How do you sleep at night?

Perfect fit between the tow hooks on the 11-16 Ford F250s, really cleans up the front end. Not extremely bright but for the price I cant complain since I plan on updating to a higher end lightbar later on. Nice flood pattern without much spot but its a nice deal regardless for $46..

This is an elegant solution for mounting LED light bars to tubular structures. Various rubber inserts are paired up to fit the tubing size.  Two stainless Allen screws are tightened with the provided Allen wrench to clamp the halves together and hold to the tube.  The variety of  rubber inserts can be combined to fit the tube you are mounting the bracket.  If needed, 3M adhesive foam tape is provided that can be applied to size the tube and/or protect the tubes.  They are made from aluminum and either powder coated or e-coated (cannot tell).  If combining inserts does not match the tube diameter a wrap of your favorite tape to build up the tube diameter so the two halves clamp tightly to the tube.  Easy-Peasey installation.I used blue Loctite to retain the Allen screws.  Blue is removable.

The bolts and fixtures themselves are great but be careful with the O rings because after a couple weeks they will crack and eventually rip, you can replace them with a higher quality O ring or a couple of zip ties but for the money you can't get better than this.

Right out of the box, both light each have something loose inside them (they rattle when shook) and the plastic lens does not sit flush and can not be pressed in. No doubt in my mind that water will find its way into the housing.Update: I ended up using them but for extra moisture protection I sealed  the lense in place with clear 2-part epoxy and used black RTV where the wiring enters the housing in back.

It met my initial expectations in general and is able to diagnose and list errors in multiple systems. Overall device and software are of high quality and can be easily updated over the Web after registration. I regret that battery registration module (BRT), steering angle sensor (SAS) module and  throttle alignment module (TBA/TPS) were not installed and neither available after the software updates. These modules are listed and described in the accompanying manual for this AutoMaster Pro NT624, but NOT available or accessible. These modules should appear as independent ICONS on the device desktop and they don't.

I received my system earlier in the week, Wednesday I think. I wanted to wait until the weekend to put it on so I did it this afternoon. It took about an hour to install, mainly because my 7 y/o wanted to help and she kept handing me the wrong tools. i really like the fit and finish of the system, you must, however, ensure that the piping is dead on or there will be rubbing of hoses, namely coolant hoses. Final fitment is key with this system. It took about 15 minutes once I had the proper tools to get it just right, maybe I am a stickler but that's just me. Upon finishing I took my truck for a road test and noticed almost no lag in throttle response and no noticeable added noise when getting on the throttle like some of the other reviewers. Maybe they might have had an air leak or something but I did not notice added throttle noise. I have not driven the truck for substantial distance yet, so cannot comment on the gas mileage but it does work well with the Borla 14964 cat-back exhaust I have on my 2003 Z71 Suburban. Unlike the other cheaper K&N kit that is available, there are no modifications what so ever besides removing your factory air box and reusing the mass air flow sensor. P.S. with the sensor do NOT touch the element or attempt to clean it. If the sensors are broken, the truck will run horrible and the sensor is not cheap. It did not happen to me but my buddy broke his on his on his Tahoe and the dealer wanted almost $350 so be careful!! My goal is 20 MPG and with the exhaust and K&N drop in element I was at 18.9 highway so maybe this kit will do what I need it to do and push me over 20MPG in a big SUV truck!! Hope this helps, and like I stated prior NO mods required for this system!! ***************UPDATE*************** By  putting this system on, ensure your fuel system is up to performance or you will get check engine light due to too much air and not enough fuel which is misconstrued as a malfunctioning maf sensor. Keep fuel filter changed and this is not a problem!!!! I should know it just happened to me, changed filter cleared code, all the power and responsive throttle i need!!!! Oh and i get 19.8mpg at 70 mph!!!!

Pros: nice solid construction, lockable (minor deterrent from thieves), easy to install, relocates spare tire to bedCons: expensive, needs to be braced to sit level (wood, cardboard etc. to level it out: minor: I used a folded over piece of cardboard)I installed with and without the bed liner and in both cases I needed a brace of sorts to make it sit level. I decided to leave my bed liner in and braced it with a small piece of cardboard to keep things snug. I gave it 4 stars due to the price point and need for a brace. Overall it is worth the money and I would buy it again. My spare is a full size spare on a 99 S10, tire size 205/75/15 on a 15x7 rim.

Originally ordered the Dee Zee mat due to past success with the product.  The mat didn't fit properly and was returned.  We then ordered the Westin mat and it too was returned, this time due to freight damage.  Figuring the 3rd time is a charm we ordered a second Westin mat and found what we believe are factory blemishes which includes 2 holes.  Being the more significant damages would have been positioned on the inside of the roll its unlikely they occurred in transit.  This is only a truck mat and I'm sure would have similar issues in time but we were disappointed being it was put into our new Ram truck.  Thanks to Amazon's return policy there were no issues on the returns.  But rather than continue to ship mats back and forth across the country we'll  just keep what we've got or find something locally.  It does fit properly and would probably be an attractive mat without the blemishes.

You cant beat it for the price. I bought this carrier and the extension. They went together very easily. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and applied som silicone caulk at the joints to prevent water from working its way inside of the tubes. This carrier seems like it was made especially for the Pathfinder. It is almost exactly the same size as the factory luggage rack. My only issue with the carrier is with the universal mounts. In my case, the threaded portion of the bolts are not not enough, which leaves a gap at the bracket. They can never be tightened down all the way. The threaded part itself it super long, allowing the bolts to stick up into the cargo area, potentially damaging your cargo. Most people cut off the extra with a deemed or something, but I made my own brackets. I bought 8 1/4 x 1 1/2 bolts, 16 flat washers, 8 lock washers, and 8 nuts, along with some aluminum bar 1 x 1/8 x 36.  I cut the bar into four equal pieces, and used the steel part of the universal bracket to mark the placement of holes. The aluminum is soft enough to bend around the factory roof rails, and I can snug the bolts up tight without having excess stick up into the cargo area. The whole thing is much more secure now, for about $12 in extra hardware. I don't plan on leaving this rack in place all the time, so the complaints about rust are not an issue for me. Overall I am happy with the purchase, its just too bad they couldn't thread that last inch on the universal brackets.

Ideal if you have no time to wash your car.I maintain my vehicles meticulously. Except, now we have a 1-year-old and I simply have no time to sleep let alone wash and pamper my cars. This sealant provides a piece of mind as I washed my Bimmer 2 months ago and still, when it rains, the self cleaning properties of the sealant come to life. Bird droppings loosen up and come off with just a squirt of clay lubricant. Just hosing down the car makes it much cleaner without a real washing.I put three consequtive coats of the sealant on top of each other waiting about 4 hours between the coats. Temperature was in the 70's.Two months later the car still looks acceptable after at least 4 heavy and a few light rains and being parked outside the whole time.In conclusion-if you have no time to pamper your car but still want some protection of your paint and semi decent clean look-ultima is your choice.Update:A year later, Ultima is still my go to sealent. It applies easily, does not need buffing, does not create high spots, does not leave white residue on plastic panels. It also applies to paint, rubber, plastics and glass with equally great results. It is,by far, the most forgiving, laziest,most efficient sealent I have ever used. It replaced 6 other chemicals I used to buy and stock up on. Also, a year later, after applying it liberally after washes and also using it to soak and remove bird dropping I still have about 20% ot the bottle left. At this point, all my car buddies are sold on it as well.Don't take my word for it. It is only a few bucks-buy one bottle and try it yourself. You will ask yourself why didn't you try it earlier!

This is possibly the best modification I have ever done to any bike. I rode my 1199S for about two days before ordering one. I love everything else about the bike besides the ridiculous torture rack of a seat. It reminds me of my 999, and now I wish I had just purchased a better seat at the time. The price is a little bit insane, and you can get a seat custom fabricated for less, but the combination of cover material (much grippier), foam/gel or whatever it is, and the new profile is a winning combination. I do not notice the increase height at all (I'm 5'8") and I am actually putting much less weight on my wrists due to the fact that I'm not sliding into the tank and it's easier to hold myself up.

Purchased for a 2012 JK, with 3" full suspension lift. I add these to my son's jk so he could safely tow a off road trailer, 1500lbs, 400lbs of gear. This model fit perfect and took about 1hr for install. Only time and use will reveal if they are going to last.They helped with the rear end sagging and body roll while towing the off road trailer.

Wow! Amazing quality for the money. These are mounted to my WR450F. We have beat them on 12 hour rides and they work perfect still. I did take the time to Loc Tite the outer lens covering bolts.The night capability is outstanding. I am now able to do the most extreme night rides with full confidence!Check the photosMounting them Vertical made a much nicer beam pattern. They are also slightly angled inwards. If you are planning to use on Dirtbike, make sure to upgrade the Stator. As this setup will pull 30-40watts.Doing both is highly recommended and amazing if you want to ride at night. Easily brighter the stock headlights lights on my FJ!

Just back from 10 days driving across 10 states and almost 60 hours in the car, we've used this power converter for an array of devices and I like to think we've put it through its paces. Potek sent me a sample at reduced or no cost of this item in exchange for my unbiased opinion.AIR MATTRESS - Okay, I must admit - we took the easy route. While camping in Yellowstone...I agreed....to using....an air mattress. I know, I know - awful of me! In my defense it was the girlfriend's first time properly camping and I wanted her to have a good experience, so the air mattress came with. With an extension cord going in to the tent and the Potek 500W inverter plugged in to the car's cigarette lighter, we quickly and easily inflated our air mattress. So far, so good.CAMERA CHARGER - Not surprisingly, we had no issues charging our camera batteries. Even my girlfriend's behemoth 1Ds-MkII batteries (they weigh a couple of pounds each) barely put a dent in the Potek's 500W capacity.LAPTOP CHARGER - Apple's chargers are only 80W (for the 17" macbook pro at least), so I wasn't worried about using this to charge our laptops while we drove. The fan would kick on every now and then, but otherwise by the time we had to stop for gas, my laptop was at 100%.There were several other devices we used in conjunction with this inverter (portable espresso maker, phone and gopro charging, iPad charging) that also functioned flawlessly, whether using a power brick plugged in to an outlet or simply by using the built-in USB ports.I didn't have any opportunity to test the over-power protection or the low-battery warning (since our rental didn't seem to have any issues powering this thing) but will update my review if that time comes.Overall for the price, I am very pleased and would be AS pleased if I had spent my own money on this. It did what we needed it to do without any complaints, and for that I have no problem recommending it.

Did a great job on light swirls.  I clean the front of my car a lot and so much cleaning sometimes leaves swirls in the paint.  I used this on my car with fantastic results.  Anything that helps me get through buff and polish process faster is a blessing to.  This gave me the compound and polish in one step then I applied Nanowax.  Being a bit obsessed about the condition of my 10 yr old car, I give this a thumbs up.  A note of advice; use a polisher with the right pad for the right amount of time.

I bought this primarily to keep my grocery items from sliding around in the trunk of my 2016 WRX. I typically buy one or 2 things at a time. gallon of milk, dog food stuff like that. To my disappointment, this slides around just as much. Had to put some velcro stickers underneath it to prevent sliding. But the fact that it says Subaru on it makes it worth it to me. Maybe not for you.

I was not sure these would fit my 1992 Ford pickup heater controls.  Fit? yes it did fit the shaft but the 'flat' on the knob is 180 degrees off.  When installed the back of the knob points to the fan speed or vent marks. On this truck the 'flat' is opposite of what the knob is to point to.  These would work, but look strange. Knob in not built well enough to turn the temperature control on my truck. The part that slides on the shaft is a soft nylon type material and will not stand up to much resistance to turning at all.  The temp control turns hard and it stripped out the center of the knob on the first try.  These are medium to light duty knobs.  Not the fault of these knobs, but with the orientation 180 out and not robust enough to turn my temp control these only get 4 stars.

This is exactly what I was looking for. They are pretty bright so don't be surprised, but my guess is that's what you're looking for and these are an awesome replacement for the yellow halogen bulbs in your dome or map lights. I use LEDs for most of my bulbs and I bought the pair only planning to use one for the dome light, but after seeing it I popped the second one into the map light to see how it looked - well now I'm ordering a second set. It's only day 1 so I'll see how they hold up, but my first impression as is that this is a quality product.I'm including a comparison picture of the LED and stock halogen bulbs in the map lights in my 2011 Accord Coupe.

As promised in my earlier posting. My fenders fit great and are perfit for my wide tires. Solid deal for the price and great quality. I choose to upgrade the side and front marker lights to LED and newer lenses, but as stated in earlier posted answers, originals will work, as these new lights used are Orem replacements without modifications for my 2006. Wiring for side markers do have to be extended by 3" to 4" to help place the wiring in protected mode for off road considerations. I used the ORM water proof connectors, also available off Amazon at low cost.  I also used these same connector for my adaption of my spare wheel and GR-8 top LED connections. For DIY examples search yup tube for CPO's session on led and connector install, included are url for Amazon project materials. All great upgrades for your TJ or LJ.

They look great and are similar quality as the factory ones on the front. The reason for 3 stars and not 5 is that they are not as easy to install as the directions indicate. They need a good amount of trimming and modifications to make them fit correctly. As others have indicated, you do need an additional screw to make them secure. Install took 2 hours. If they were properly stamped, not needing modification, install would be 30 Minutes.

I got these to replace a set of OEM bulbs on an MKV Jetta due to one being blown out. When you first turn them on they have a very distinct blue tint to them and the light output is not favorable for driving but as they warm up they get brighter and the blue tint burns off but not completely so you still get that "ice white" look. I prefer the white look with no blue tint to them cause that gives you the best lighting for driving but I'll rock these until it's time to replace them. For the price these are awesome and even if I have to replace them every year I still won't come close to paying the price of one OEM bulb. We will see how long they last.

This touch up paint is okay - did the job fine, but isn't wonderful. At $7 and change it's a good cheap way to fix very minor marks, but a few things to note:COLOR: Like others have said, it's ULTRA WHITE WHITE WHITE - most sinks are not this bright white, so it will stick out (unless your marks are teeny tiny in which case you won't really see the difference.) My mark was a bit on the larger side, but not big by any means, and it doesn't SCREAM white but if you look for a few seconds you can easily pick out the spot. Not terrible, but somewhat noticeable.STAYING POWER: It's been a few weeks and with daily use of the sink (touch up spot is in the middle where water hits) it's held up well, but we did leave it for 2 days to fully dry, so that may help. I think most people are using this for little dots/marks, not huge spots so they should hold on okay, or at the worst need a little touch up down the line. I think the formula looks like white out lol - but if it stays for a while it's a lot better than the brown showing underneathPRICE: $7 and change is fair - the bottle is bigger than you will ever need unless you have TONS and tons of spots and things to touch up :)It's a good cheap way to fix little marks, but note the glaring white shade and don't' expect this to work with deep or large spots.

Real reviewer, i paid 99- for this to prevent toddlers from slipping down the rv steps.  Overall bars are a good design and solid construction.  However that being said, and on most rvs, the mounting location (steps housing) will not facilitate the leverage effect these rails cause, thereby being very wobbly- and it can bend or mangle the step frame if not careful when using.  I suppose thats why they include a thin velcro strap for the top to be afixed an existing rv handle, but it proves to be a very minimal assist and i imagine would not last with UV and weathering- and makes for yet another step when setting up.  It took about 1/2 hour to assemble and mount with powertools, drilling is required.  Then I spent another 30min scavenging in my garage and fabricating a steel support piece about 8 inches above their mounting bracket (see photo, last pic). It made a huge difference, now after the mod the whole rail feals solid and me/wife and my 3 & 5 y/o kids can securely climb up and down tugging on it plenty without concern... I also might figure out a ground steak or something to keep the end on the ground more secure better than the flat foot provided. Without the mod it did not feel secure enough from side to side like a railing should be, but perhaps if u just need to pull on it to assist stair climbing its ok but in that case it would be cheaper to go with one of the folding handles that fold over the door. Just my 2 cents.. hope it helps someone in their decisions...

wow for the price of this light bar you can't ask for anything better. I read the reviews and all were good so I decided to get one. The light bar is very well constructed and seems to be well built. I installed it to the ranchhand bumper with out any problems. It looks awesome and I can't wait to hit the road and light up. I will have to get one for my sons 99 Jeep. By the way Amazon Prime is awesome

This stuff is magical. I was stupid to use scotch heavy duty dish pad to remove some beewax off my wife's leased car... It did remove beewax fine, but left me with nasty scratches all over the clearcoat... My wife was not happy to see what's left the next morning... I had some turtle wax scratch remover laying around so I tried that first... After buffing the same scratch for over 15 min, nothing changed... So I know I needed something more "Pro" level. That's when I found the Meguiar's Utimate Compound... It only took about 15-20 min of elbow grease to remove each scratched area (and there is a lot of them) but the results are truly amazing! Scratches are polished to be invisible if you are standing 2 ft away, but still noticeable if you look right next to scratched area.Further buffing with the compound and then the ultimate polish and finally the utimate wax will take care of everything.It's quite a lot of pure elbow grease but the result have to be seen to appreciate. Now we don't have to worry about returning the car at end of lease and get fined thousands for paint damages... Thanks Meguiar, you made me a believer!

The only issue was to install the old mounting bolt in to the new compressor . It was very -very tricky and tough . I suggest a new bolt  any time for  parts like this . This compressor is using PAG 150  and the  Delphi customer service is one of the best out there to help you with any question .

Brakes, who needs em? Just find a tree on the side of the road, that will slow you down... Brakes are one of those things I like to change out when I get a new vehicle.  As far as brakes go, Disks are easy and drums are a pain. If you are going to change out the brakes spend a few extra bucks and get  the kit. Who wants old springs falling apart in the drum? I did a full blog with lots of photos on 1995wrangler.com Make sure the tension cable for the adjusting lever is seated in the correct hole or the lever will hang too low. See Photo below.

I got this for a custom true dual application where I needed the x pipe to be narrow and short. This option seemed the best, and I have owned magnaflow parts in the past.For the price im a little disappointed in the build quality. The internals are very poor flowing and will no doubt create a lot of turbulence due to very poor stamp design. On top of that, there are weld splatters converting the outside (not important), the inside (important), and a good layer of dust, grease, shavings,  and other filth from manufacturering, which will need to be removed especially if you have cats located after this piece to prevent damage to them. Note: the photo is after I polished and washed the component. Note the poor flow characteristics, it may be hard to see in the photo, but in person you can see all the rough spots the flow will encounter.With a little work and a can of mothers aluminum polish, you can clean up the look of the outside if you want, but the turbulence will rob your ride of the full power the x pipe should give you. An exhaust shop may be able to modify the part, but doing so will double the cost of the x pipe. That being the case I suggest looking elsewhere, or if you need something this sized, ask a reputable exhaust shop to fabricate one for you.

Feels nice and sturdy. Its not too heavy. I didn't get to load my bike in it yet but I did walk up the ramp into my truck. I have a 08 Honda Ridgeline not sure how or if the custom screws installs on that. But it can be tied down and made to fit regardless with the straps. The ramp open and closing tension is nice and strong. I recommend this ramp.

This is a nice part. Works well for my application, but not quite perfect. The manufacturer has tried to create a "universal" part that will fit square or round tube receivers. It doesn't quite fit a round tube though, but with many different tubes sizes to account for, this is an acceptable approach, but worth a star reduction. I trimmed mine to fit my tube, but it just doesn't fit flush on both sides - it's either/or, not both. If one side touches, the other doesnt'. I just had the front fit flush and left it alone for now, but I did purchase another to slowly cut away the plastic to see about fitment and my ocd issues haha.Overall, a very nice product that works wonders. I have a 2000 Jeep Cherokee XJ that had the original factory tow package and receiver hitch. The Hitch had rusted pretty badly from it's previous lift in the northeast, and I decided to replace it with a Curt 13160 hitch (review there also). The original had a pocket welded on that housed the OEM 7-pin connector, and the Curt does not. This product solves the problem of where to mount the connector. The only other place I had was on my bumper, which is custom and has a tire carrier - I did not want to modify that.My OEM 7-pin connector fits right into this, and using the supplied band I strapped it around the Curt tube. Before I tightened it up, I positioned it where I would have easy access and it was pleasing to the eye. You can see in the picture attached (installation of the hitch and tire carrier required my bumper to be removed, this was in the process of lining it up) that the box tucks nicely up against the bumper and holds the connector in a location that works well.

These are so comfortable, can't say it enough. I put these on my Biltwell Chump bars and they look and feel incredible.For installation: I put these on brand new bars; using advice I read from another reviewer I used rubbing alcohol as a lubricant. I put the alcohol inside the rubber and on the bars and quickly slid the grips on the bars/throttle before it dried. It was surprisingly easy. If the alcohol dried on the bars I would just keeping adding rubbing alcohol to help it slide on. Seconds after they were tight and haven't budged at all since.

I have read some of the other reviews out there, and they pretty much cover most of the basic stuff, so I will not go into a lot of detail about the fuses. But I will add on to what other have said.Basically, these fuses are the mini type.. They are mostly used on cars, from around 2000 and up.. Cars in the 80's and 90's mostly used the ATC type of fuse, and before that, mostly use more the cylinder or glass tube with metal ends, type of fuse. As for the fuses, and where they are used. Unlike the old cars, where the fuses were in just one fuse box, which was inside the car, or seating area, these day, there is usually 2 fuse boxes. One in the engine compartment, and one inside the seating area. The ones inside the seating area, are usually around the dashboard somewhere, and can very from in the door jams, to inside the glove compartment (this one is not too common these days), to under the molding down by your feet (this one could be on the side molding, or under the dash board assembly).If you look at a lot of the fuse boxes, a lot of them will come with some open spaces, where you can store an extra fuse or a few of them. They are usually marked off in some way. I try to put a couple in there, of a few different sizes, so I have one on hand, just in case one blows and you do not have some with you. This way, there is always an extra one on hand, just in case. These spaces are not usually filled from the factory, but are put there for your convenience, in case you do choose to put some extra ones in there. This may be something to consider if you blow fuses a bit.As for these. Overall, they are not bad. Not great, but not bad. I think that they need to do a few things to make these better though. First, start by putting numbers on the end that are readable.. They have just an indent to tell you the size, but it is made out of the same plastic as the rest of the fuse, so it is not easy to read. Maybe put some paint on it so it is easier to read. Add a little bit of a lip, or some texture to the side of the fuse, so that it is easier to grip, and pull out would be nice too. The case, could also stand to be a LOT smaller. While this one is not really bad, it is not very convenient to store in a small place, maybe like your glove box, because it is so big. You could always put them in another container if you want too, but one more convenient for storage, would be better from the start. I would guess that only about 10% of the space, is actually used with the fuses.. The rest is just open air. I combined all the different sizes, and types into this one box, and I still do not have it even half filled. Just way to big.The size of the box is 8 1/4" long, 4 1/8" wide (this does not include hinges, just the main area), and 1 1/8" thick. The plastic to it is a cheap, flexible plastic. It reminds me more of the new, eco friendly DVD cases that are out these days.. It works, and has 2 latches to keep it shut, so it does serve its intended purpose just fine, but it also is not durable enough to take much abuse either. To be fair, this is a cheap setup, so I can not complain too much for the price. The fuses work and that is what is important.If you are going to be replacing the fuses, since these are not marked very well on the end, with the numbers, to make them easy to read, something good to know, if you did not know, is that they are color coded. Most fuses, with a blade on them, like these, or event he ATC type, use the same color coding for the fuse, where the color matches the size.1 amp is black (not in this set)2 amp is grey (not in this set)3 amp is violet, or a type of purple (not in this set)4 amp is pink (not in this set)5 amp is tan (can also look more of a light yellowish brown too)7 1/2 amp is brown (usually more of a medium brown in darkness)10 amp is red15 amp is blue (can be light, or medium in darkness)20 amp is yellow (some may look yellowish orange)25 amp is clear30 amp is green40 amp is amber (a yellowish orange color) (not in this set)Yea, I know, I said yellowish orange on 2 of them, but the yellow on some of the older, ATC fuses, actually looks amber, even though it is supposed to be yellow, so always better to double check the number on them if possible. The color coding should be are generic way to see what amp the fuse is, but is not always fool proof, as with the yellow and amber colors, and one can be mistaken for the other, with some fuses. Most cars, in regular fuses, do not use above a 30 amp. If they do, it is not usually a standard size fuse, like these. So you usually will not need above a 30.I am including some photos, so you can see, just how much of a color difference there is, from one brand to another, even though, they are all supposed to be the same color. I put them in sequence, from 5 amp, all the way up to 30 amp, and put like color/amp ones together.This is not a bad set, but like I said, could be better with a few small changes. It is still well worth the money. I personally prefer getting something made in the USA if I can, as this set is made in china, but the only ones that I know are made in the USA, that I could find, were many times more expensive then this one, and while I am willing to pay a little more for made in the USA stuff, I am not willing to pay 3 or more times more, for it. That gap is too big, which is why I went with these.

I'm giving this a two star rating for a couple of reasons. The first one is because I can't find anywhere in the description where it says, be aware, this item will not work if attached to power that has a GFI. Why would this be? Not really sure but I contacted customer service because I could not get this to work at all in the state parks of Michigan, at least the only two I have been able to try. I thought something was wrong with the unit so I contacted customer service and was told you cannot use it with a GFI protector already in place. So, Now I question what good is it then? Almost everyone now has the ground fault interrupters on anything that been replaced in the last 10 to 15 years or so. The other reason, and not such a big deal as it not working is it is so big and bulky not only does it lay on the ground, you cant close the lid to even lock it in place. Of course it has big beautiful bouncing lights that flicker on and off and back and forth in a steal me fashion. Maybe this is something that will work for you, Thank goodness this is amazon because its going back. On a better note, Customer service was pretty fast at getting back to me via email so that was a plus.

ordered these to put on my friends jeep. they look great, THE WIRING KIT ONLY COMES WITH 1 BLUE WIRE and some connectors, does not come with a full kit like advertised (thus a minus star) I had to go and buy additional wire to wire up the lights, the blue wire is only a power wire that runs from the battery to the interior of the vehicle where the switch is. ORDER A WIRING KIT AND MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER.for the price though these are a pretty darn good buy. (my jeep is the one without lights)

Install was a breeze, and they add a nice look to my truck. It's also nice to be able to leave my windows cracked without worrying about the rain.Just make sure you thoroughly clean the area you are putting the shades before you install them to make sure they stick properly. I also recommend a dry fit before you apply them.

Not 125W like the title and specifications in the item details claims. Not even the 15W "actual power" they try to hide in the details.  Nope, these are barely 10 Watts.  I connected them to a small AC/DC inverter (battery charger) which has 0.8W overhead, and they read about 11.4W = 10.5 Watts not including the power used by the rest of the circuit.In fact, I looked up what exactly a Cree U5 is and... it's a 10W LED, plain and simple.

The stuff seems to have been messed with when I got it. Things were connected and they weren't placed in the box properly. The directions are for several different kits and they used broken English. On top of that the wiring diagrams were worthless so in general were of little help. There was one thing that I got out of them though. If the light don't work reverse the pos and neg wires. That didn't seem to apply to these as the plugs only go one way. Ah! all but the one that plugs into the OEM headlight wire. That one is reversible. So if your lights don't work just turn the plug over and you're good to go. One more thing that will help. These are straight not like the originals that have a 90 deg bend so getting them aligned with the tangs is tough to do. If you compare these to the original and line them up the same way you'll save yourself some fiddling. I have only just installed them (took about 20 minutes) so I can't comment on how they work at night or how long they'll last. But next to the original lights they are super WHITE and bright. The originals are very yellow in comparison (actually Sylvania Silver Stars that cost me $50. Now I'm going to get a pair for the high beams if they come on instantly. I'll update later.

i replaced my cargo light and the Engine compartment light using these adapters. Cargo light is bright, and nice non-blue white.It comes with tape, but i just let mine sit inside the glass panel of the Cargo. That way the wires won't end up stuck to it.For the Engine light, i believe i had solder paperclips to the ends, as my festoon used the "loop/hook" attachments instead of the wedge/push kind.On first try i ended up blowing a fuse as one of the wires came unattached from the smd panel board...and thermal runway kicked in and the board was toast in 2 seconds. But i had and extra. I made sure to add extra solder to it. haven't had any problems since. And the light is plenty bright to check fluids/battery/cooling system (simple roadside fixes.) Which, for a Jeep, is the stuff that plagues you.Good: been a year, and they still work. no flickering. The tape is fairly strong.Bad: Small gauge wiring, but won't be and issue unless your planning on wiring multiple in series i presume...which isn't really what they're designed for anyway. The soldering job on the smd panel isn't the most spec. Doesnt come loop festoon adapter...or a 1156 adapter.UPDATE: 2 years later and the cargo light is barely lit. Will check to make sure the wiring hasn't come loose. Knocking 1 star, as this adds to the previously mentioned issues.UPDATE: bought another and it arrives broken from the package. Knocking another star

Seems like a well built lock.  No issues whatsoever, simple to use.I'm not sure how secure it actually is, and the reason for the 3 stars.  I think a shorter length would help, seems to me it would be more secure giving less of a gap for cutting tools.  Either way if someone wants something they are gonna get it locked or unlocked.

I installed this on my 2005 LLY. The hardest part is removing the factory components. When I put this on, the down pipe wouldnt seat into the back of the turbo. After fighting it for a bit, I ended up sanding the paint off and it fit as it should have. Had it not been for the thick paint this would have been a 5 Star review. Photo is of the down pipe before I removed the paint. The gap would never close up to less than 3/16 and allow me to get the clamp installed.

Easy install and works well. I could not feel any difference but I like the sound. On moderate throttle, it sounds raucous and also you can definitely hear turbos!Only problem is that it is not a tight seal. I used chalk to verify. So I cleaned up under the hood and used weather stripping. Now it works well and pulls in cold air instead of hot under hood air.5 stars for looks and theory and 3 because I had to use weather stripping for best fit.In pic I show a dry pre filter cover from AEM because in Buffalo we get a lot of dust from road salt in winters.

Purchased on Dec 18, 2016 and noticed today on Aug 10, 2017 under the rubber step rust marks are running down the side and I live in Charleston SC.  The truck has never seen any type of salty roads.  So I'm starting to think I might have made a mistake with this purchase.This seller is awesome to say the very least.  They worked with me to make this right.  I ended up buying another set Directly of the polished stainless step bars and using that box to return these.  Found the problem with these step bars as I removed them.  Water was collecting inside and not draining.  Not sure how it was getting in, but I'm thankful the seller worked with me to make this right.  Absolute First Class service from this seller.

Hooked this light up and it was bright. Lots of wires so I zipped tied them together. Wire got pulled slightly and came right out of the light. Attempted to fix it myself but there is no way. I'll take 1/2 the blame but I'll also put half the blame on poor craftsmanship. After taking the unit apart and inspecting it, the solder points were poor and the internal wires were very thin which led to the easy break of the hot wire. Bike is already wired so I have no choice but to order this same light and replace. Will be leaving plenty of slack in the wires this time.

I have a 2009 ext cab with 150k miles. the stock exhaust was okay. Time to upgrade due to pulling a work trailer. This is the easiest we installed. Follow the instructions, and you will need a sawsall for the hangers and the pipe ( we cut it just after the muffler ). The fit was excellent .The sound is no louder than stock, just a nice throaty sound. The stock muffler is tinning. Good quality,works as planned. I would buy another. The only con is the muffler clamp is dead center on the muffler, which shows the bolt, not a clean finish. Our tip and pipes changed color with in a week, no biggie.UPDATE.......as of May 25 2017 with 46K miles on this Exhaust system, the exit pipe weld has broken lose. Dynomax has a limited lifetime warranty, but who's doing the warranty? Amazon or Dynomax ?

I purchased a new 2017 Jeep Cherokee Trail Hawk and only had a few days to prepare to tow, before hitting the road on an extended trip.  I already had the Blue Ox tow bar used with my previous vehicle, and trust the Blue Ox products.  They give excellent instructions, my son and I followed them to remove the front plastic fascia from the new Jeep, remove the red tow hooks, did a tiny bit of grinding, install the new baseplate (its in two pieces), and reassembled the fascia.  Looks great, comes with all the pieces needed for installation and use.  So far, so good, over 1200 miles of towing, 8 stops to disconnect and reconnect.  All seems great.

Pump failed after only 2 months and 700 hundred miles... bolted up nicely, but today (May 11) it started squealing and has radial play in the shaft/bearing.I filed a return with Amazon, but was advised the "Return period expired".  Note: Amazon 'policy' on auto parts is to honor warranties.[*UPDATE #1 to my remark above:  I managed to navigate the Amazon 'contact' maze and cited their auto parts policy. They are sending a free replacement via next day shipping.  Problem is, I no longer trust Airtex quality, and have already ordered the Motorcraft OEM pump. Another reviewer claims Airtex is the OEM pump supplier, that is -NOT- correct... the closet match to OEM is the Gates branded pump.][**UPDATE #2: The Airtex replacement pump arrived today (May 13), and so did the Motorcraft pump. The Airtex box was (again) ill-suited and the pump had bounced around. Part of the pump had punctured the box and was sticking out... upon inspection, the bearing/shaft exhibited radial play and was damaged/defective... strike three. Get a clue Aritex!  By contrast, the Motorcraft pump was nicely packaged with some sensible protection for the impeller and bearing.  See pics: Motorcraft on left, Airtex on right...the Motorcraft casting is superior.]I installed the Motorcraft pump, and we made our 2400 mile seasonal journey without any additional cooling system issues.No more games with crucial parts for our 2000 F250 7.3 Powerstroke... 'budget' parts are not worth the risk and aggravation.

I've been a fan of Chemical Guys products.  I was getting tired of buying the expensive aerosol cans and the big brand store so I decided to try this.  I also purchased the pump they sell to make it easier to use.  So far I have used it on my tires and on my wife's black plastic parts on her 2007 Ford Edge.  It has brought back a shine to the faded plastic parts.  For tires I purchased the Chemical Guys ACC_3002 Durafoam foam applicator.  I highly recommend this product.

Very good light bulb to replace my old type of bulb.I had A12V8W light bulb in my dome light that burned out and I needed replacement. I have MItsubishi Outlander.The new light fits perfectly and give 3 times brighter light then old one. Not mentioning that new light is not yellow, its bright white.I love this bulb.It dims with no problems as the old one when you lock the car.

I was specifically looking for a cargo net I could attach onto the backend of my Vespa Scooter Seat for an extra helmet. These nets work perfectly. The hooks can also be adjusted which is great. The material on these are 10x better than the ones you buy at the dollar store. They're great for what I needed them for. I've attached photos.Also everyone keeps complaining about these cargo nets getting constantly tangled.I came up with an easy solution. I've attached photos.**Photos are of iron hook cargo net not this cargo net with plastic hook but works on both cargo nets.1. Paint the tips of all three hooks that go on one side of your Motorcycle/Vespa (with paint or nail polish)2. Grab the three hooks with one hand and the opposite three hooks with the other, then fold together. So all hooks are in one hand3. With all hooks in one hand fold net in half and place a rubber band so it stays together for storage.4. When you need your cargo net hold all three hooks with paint in one hand, release rubber band and net will come down smoothly.***instructions might seem a little complicated but it's worth it. It'll take 10 seconds tops to unfold with no tangles so no embarrassing situations occur.These cargo nets work as advertised. I received two of these cargo nets free in exchange for my honest review. One with plastic hooks and one with iron hooks. To my surprise I personally preferred the cargo net with iron hooks because they were easier to attach onto my Scooter seat and thin enough to still close my seat without any problems. The plastic hooks work great too, just seem a little too bulky to attach under my seat.Definitely sturdy cargo nets that I would recommend.

These are a great improvement over the stock side markers which had yellowed over time.  The flashing LED is a little different, but looks good and I like the appearance during the day.  A before and after photo are attached of my e61 BMW 535i Estate Sport Wagon.  The only reason why the product did not get 5 stars was that no instructions are included on how to replace the side markers.  I had to find a video on line about changing them.  The lack of instructions was frustrating since the LED does not connect the same way the OEM side marker does.  You much plug the LED side marker l lead into the actual light bulb holder. I would not have figured this out without some online help.To install them, push the stock lights forward and then pry them up.  They are spring loaded to be held in place.  The tricky part is where to plug in the new light.  The new side markers do not attach with the same connector as the OEM lights.  Rather, remove the regular bulb from the OEM side marker and push the new side marker wire into where the regular bulb would plug in.  Use electrical tape to secure the new connection.  Then install the side marker similar to removing the original OEM side marker.  The new side marker is also spring loaded.  Press it in then slide to the left/right and it clicks in.  Installation took under 5 minutes.Photos are are original, then smoked LED side marker.

**tip: spray your engine first and use a spray bottle with Dawn and a towel to clean tough or delicate (electrical) areas after using the foam, then use plastic restorer on hoses and plastic covers in the engine!**Cleaned my 2012 Nissan frontier engine bay with this.  70,000 miles and never cleaned prior to now. I sprayed with a pressure washer prior to washing but a regular hose would work too.  Soak everything, spray it, leave it for fifteen minutes, and spray clean.  Disconnecting a battery is a good idea!Pros: easy to use, degreases and cleans pretty well! Sprays far and hard for hard to reach areas.  Cleans off very easily. Some scrubbing required!Cons: bottle didn't like being turned sideways or upside down, doesn't clean things spotless. Elbow grease required.

With 2 modifications, this is the perfect tool for flushing automotive cooling systems.First, immediately remove the plastic quick connect fittings that come with this and get different ones at Home Depot. Preferably one with an automatic shut-off valve, so that you don't spray water everywhere when you accidentally disconnect it.Second, you need to attach a regulator to the air input. If you put shop air pressure (90psi) into a cooling system, something will break. I bought a cheapo unit at Harbor Freight and attached quick connects to it, so I can use it with other tools as well.With those two things, you've got a tool that's every bit as good as the Gates Powerflush tool, (http://www.amazon.com/Gates-Rubber-Company-91002-Power/dp/B008QEZGEM) but costs less that a quarter of the price.

The instructions are adequate and exactly correct.The supplied hardware is high quality and fits perfectly.There was no cutting or trimming required.Bolts directly to chassis.Super Strong.Does not interfere with or disrupt blind spot radar sensors.The required tool list is small and exactly correct.Most inconspicupous hitch ever.Does not infringe ground  or tail clearance.Receiver projects down through hole already provided in VW bumper cover.For an experienced installer this is a "3" and less than 1 hr; for a home mechanic its a "6" and around 2hrs.The instructions are quite specific, follow them carefully.

This stuff is the best!  I have used it on smaller projects in the past, but just had to clean rust and paint off of four vintage chrome table legs so had a big job ahead of me.  You wouldn't believe the difference if I told you so I have added photos as proof.  ;-)  In the first picture, the cleaned leg looked just like the non-cleaned leg before I took the Nevr-Dull to it.  The second picture shows all four legs cleaned.  It took me about 3.5 hours and I don't mind admitting I thought of giving up more than once on the first leg, but am glad I didn't.When working on these legs, I pulled a good 2"x2" size sheet out of the can to work with.  Once you've rubbed enough and have it worked in, you can actually start scraping rust off with your fingernail.  These legs had old paint near the tops and pooled rust on the inside of the bottom.  Some purists may disagree with me on this, but I ended up using a flat razor to help.  Keep it as flat on it's side as possible and go VERY lightly to minimize any scratching.Whatever liquid that is inside it does tend to evaporate after a while.  This happens over years, though, so don't be worried.  I am planning on putting my newest can inside a resealable plastic bag to see if that helps.

I was excited to receive my hitch shackle. When I opened it, I notice there was some chips on the paint down to the metal. I have read a few reviews stating it is powder coated. I am not to sure if it is.  Other than the paint chip, it looks and feel solid. Only time will tell if it holds up to what it is intended to do. If it doesnt, I will post an update. I have taken a few shots with measurements in case you are wondering.

They lit right out of the box.  That is half the battle.My purchase was for the H11/(H8/H9) size.  I am using this in my low beam driving lamp.  The first thing that you will notice is that there is no projector lens on top.  The reason for this is so that you do not distract or blind oncoming traffic.  This lamp is designed with "COB" (chip-on-board) LED on 4 sides, and in the same placement as halogen lamp filament, in order to mimic the light output of a halogen lamp.  In this fashion, lighting is designed hit your reflector in the same place, and bounce in the same way.  This lamp was engineered to produce similar or better light output than your OEM halogen.Chip-on-Board LED technology describes the mounting of a bare LED chip in direct contact with the substrate to produce LED arrays. It is a method of LED packaging which has a number of advantages over traditional surface mount technologies such as the use of T-pack and Surface mount LEDs.H11 (55 W @ 12.0 V, 1350 lm 10% @ 13.2 V) H9 (65 W @ 12.0 V, 2100 lm 10% @ 13.2 V).This lamp's output of 2 X 4000 lumen per lamp should be more than adequate for your lighting needs.Installation is simple, as long as you know how to change a light bulb.  These are meant to plug into your factory harness, and fit right into your factory light housing.Your first issue will be what to do with all that extra wiring and the power supply unit.  The power supply supplies the correct power for the LED lamps & the fan at the base; it is not a ballast.  Two cable ties are included, but what do you do with them since the power supply unit does not have an attachment point.  Find a way to secure this, even if you have to epoxy the power supply to hold it still.  Double sided adhesive could also work for you.  Worst case scenario, you can always use cable clips  You do not want to drive around with a dangling power supply and loose wires.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Car-Cable-Clip-CIKIShield-Car-Charger-Mounts-Cable-Tie-Holder-Car-Cable-Organizer-Desk-Wall-Cable-Wire-Clips-Computer-Electrical-Cord-Cable-Tie-Drop-Black-50-Pieces/dp/B01LXK7889/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Car Cable Clip,CIKIShield Car Charger Mounts Cable Tie Holder, Car Cable Organizer, Desk Wall Cable Wire Clips, Computer, Electrical, Cord Cable Tie Drop (Black, 50 Pieces)</a>For some, your next issue will be the covers over the back of the lamp housing.  Those covers are there to keep moisture, dirt, dust, grease, grime, et cetera, out of your headlamp housing.  Do not try to shove all your wiring and your power supply unit into the housing, and then reapply the cover.  This will trap the heat.  These lamps need to be ventilated and cooled.  That is why there is a built in fan at the base.  You will have to decide if you can live without the covers, or if you want to overheat your unit and cause a heat related failure.Okay, so now, only time will tell.......stay tuned for an update on this review.The first rain of the season has arrived.  I have been running these lamps without the rubber covers over the back of my headlamp housing.  So far, no issues with moisture.  The rubber seal at the base of the lamp, where it meets the OEM housing, has done a stellar job of keeping moisture out.  Lighting wet and dry roads has been acceptable.  To my naked eye, it appears as if I'm seeing more of the road than with my halogen lamps.  The sharp white light is an advantage over dull yellow.And if you have any fitment or installation issues, customer service is responsive and knowledgeable.  Gina & Dora are extremely knowledgeable in regards to their product.

They look great, match the white very well. Fit isn't the best. They don't fit flush on both ends, so you can choose a side or center them. One was chipped on the end, but its on the side facing the handle so its not seen. Overall, they add to the looks of the Jeep and price-to-value is good.

I purchased this spark plug for my Poulan P4018 chainsaw (twin cycle, 40cc motor, 18" bar) - replacement is pretty easy. Three T-25 Torx head screws then work off the top cover for access to the spark plug itself, which you unscrew like any standard spark plug. The spark plug fits well both in threads, and the exposed electrical connection. The cover goes fully back in place with no issues (well, no more than the OEM sparkplug. You have to fiddle the cover around the handle and brake. Not the fault of the spark plug)My chainsaw never started so easily, even when it was brand new with the OEM Champion sparkplug. Kudos to NGK for making a great quality, affordable spark plug.

I have a 2001 Ford F-150 Super Crew Short regular bed pick up, so everything relates to that installation. This will probably cover 2001-2005 or so depending on when they made significant changes to the truck.  This light bar (strip) comes with an adhesive strip backing and 4 plastic clamps with screws. Throw those clamps and screws in your junk bin.  The reason is that those clamps will force you to mount your light bar about 3/8" above the bed end plate and your tell gate will block the view (See Photo 1-3)  Sorry if some photos are upside down.  Since you have to drill holes in the end of the bed anyway, here's what you should do.  Fit, but don't stick the light bar as far down as you can on the bed end plate.  Locate 4-6 equally spaced drill locations and scribe or mark a horizontal line at the top side of the light bar.  Remove the light bar.  Drill a 3/16-1/4" hole so that it is centered on that horizontal line at each location you marked.  Debur the hole on both sides.  Remove the adhesive strip cover and press the light bar on at the bottom of the bed end plate.  Then thread a zip tie (1/8"-3/16" wide ZT) through the holes and around the light bar and secure.  See photo 4 as an example. See Photo 5 for the result.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/49-34-Auto-Tailgate-LED-Light-Bar-Red-White-Reverse-Stop-Running-Brake-Turn-Signal/dp/B00PJVOKDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">49" Auto Tailgate LED Light Bar Red White Reverse Stop Running Brake Turn Signal</a>

Very nice, very bright.. Set it up one week ago as DRLs, with a 100ohm 100W rheostat for night driving and a total of three relays. They lost one star because I was sent three right angled small feet and one left angled small foot. But the light itself is heavy and well built. Time will tell if it supports rain and my use as DRL.UPDATE: moisture got inside the lamp after the first car wash. They still work, but it might be just a matter of time that they fail because of the water inside.

It appears sturdy but it's not universal.  It will not work for my trailer with the disc brake actuator coupler (see photo) even though it has a 2" coupler. It's designed for trailer couplers with the rounded lip.  As a result, I had to return it and bought instead the Trimax UMAX50, which fits more universally.

Fit is perfect on my 2016 JK. I don t have any of the hood hop , I have seen in the reviews. I used the 3 M supplied tape to mount them and it is holding good after 500 miles. Now did it really keep the bug butts off my window. Maybe 50% less hits. The pictures in the ad make it look very short , and not much lift . But that is not the case at all. It stands a good 2 inches above the hood. No real need for the hood bumpers they include in the kit. No way are you going to have it flex down to the hood to scratch it. I say its worth the money.

My ageing keyfob kept falling apart in the middle and was recently secured with some electrical tape.  After seeing this I thought why not.  It fits decently enough but my style is slightly different than the one pictured. My keyring attachment point is in a corner not on a raised bar as in the photos.  Not a problem.  I just threaded my keyring through the silicone shell. Can't even tell it's not supposed to be this way.

Disappointed - the first optimate I ordered was for my motorcycle, it drained the battery instead of charging it. I returned it, changed the battery to lithium and ordered a new optimate and it has been working fine.I just got the optimate 6 select On Saturday , it is stuck with LED 1a and 1b lit, no other leds are on, select touch doesn't do anything, connected to battery or not, it stays in this state with just two leds on nothing else.Really disappointing documentation with no troubleshooting guide.Update:I called Techmate expecting some support for troubleshooting before returning it to Amazon, the lady said she will email me a warranty form and I have to attach proof of purchase and then a technician will call me. I told her how disappointed that I can't get simple support for something I bought 2 days ago. She then took my number and said a technician will call me, I won't hold my breathe. Really disappointed with companies that can't provide, simple support via documentation, website or over the phone live. Probably won't buy techmate again.Also the technical support and repair forms on their website don't work.Second update:Tech support did call me back, they said to send it in and they will repair it, I told them it is easier to send it to Amazon and get a new one.They also know of the issue that the support forms are not working on their website.Last update:Got the quick replacement thanks to Amazon, Techmate wanted me to ship to them for repairs :(Few things you should know, I have learned from experience and they run across all models.1. They are finicky.2. The manual will say hold select button for 3 seconds, it takes more like 12seconds to switch to 14.7v from 14.4v3. If you have both terminals connected to battery when switching you will switch to Power supply mode, if you have only one terminal connected you will likely "Break" the charger.4. When you first plug in it will do a test and show you current charge, after that the Red 'Safe' light will go on, in most cases first time it will stay there. You will have to change the polarity of the plug or unplug and plug a few times and it will go to the next step of charging...finicky.I am using it on a new AGM battery, car has less than 600miles and I don't drive this one a lot.

Fit was good, and the end result was great.  However, it came bent on the bottom pretty bad.  Looks like it was packaged poorly and had pressure on it.  I was able to fix it with a heat gun.  I could have returned it, but I wanted to install it today!  I wish the plastic texture matched the OEM dash texture.

This antenna was a direct fit for my truck.  It's solid black and looks great against the white color of the truck. This replaced a funky aftermarket antenna the previous owner installed.

We at CUSTOM AUTO DETAILING have been researching this product for about 3 months. Finally, we gave it spin and we are very verypleased the the results. Just remember, it's about finding the RIGHT COMBINATION to get the FULL POTENTIAL out of any product that you may purchase. We have purchased many different types of products and they all work very well. It is very important to take the time to find that combination and it might take a while However, when you do you will see an INCREDIBLE DIFFERENCE in the performance of the product. Great on vehicles that have been treated. Next stop is to try it on an untreated vehicle. We were review again in the weeks to come on the BUTTER WET WAX.  IN the meantime GET SOME BUTTER!!!

I can't believe what an easy fix this was.  After installing this carburetor my Tao 125cc runs even better than the original non-serviceable carburetor.  I am going to get 2 more of these instead of spending time cleaning it. Fast shipping too!

While these bulbs are extremely bright, some of the 4014 emitters were DOA. A few of the emitters on the end of the bulb were not lighting up at all. I think they need better quality control. The bulbs come packaged in a generic japanese LED bulb package with some really bad english on the back. I always find it amusing to read the instructions on items that come directly from China or Japan. "Manking sure the replacement LED lamp wedeg is same with original lamp" "Don' t keep your seyes on the lamp when it was tumed on"It's sad that these bulbs have dead emitters because they give off a lot of light. Since some were DOA, i can only imagine that these bulbs are prone to fail.I received this product for free or at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. My review is my own personal opinion and I have not been encouraged by the manufacturer or any third party to leave a positive or dishonest review.

Aesthetically, these bulbs look exactly like how most HID's look. They appear to be bright when compared to the stock H7 bulbs, but when you get behind the wheel and start driving, they don't really illuminate any better than the stock bulbs. What I would suggest as a better replacement for visibility (not necessarily aesthetics) would be the Philips X-treme Vision +130% Headlight Bulbs (Pack of 2) (H7 55W), about a similar price, but so much better! Photo is of the stock (left) compared to these bulbs (right).

This item paid for itself on the first use. Used this on a 2005 Chrysler PT Cruiser- auto shop wanted $65 for diagnostic, $65/ hr labor, $40 for part plus tax! Used this maxis can bought part in store for $28 and put it on in 5 min. It honestly took me longer to drive up on the ramps, place jack stands for safety and slide under than to change this. All you need is a 7/8 wrench. Meter is easy to read, you can also use YouTube for tutorial if you don't have Haynes manual. Have now used it for 2 others to dx their cars. Be confident in fixing things yourself or knowledgeable enough so as not to get ripped off at dealerships and auto repair shops.

Pretty cheap product and I will need to buy a 3 ton jack in the future...wish this company made one of those.  Definitely beats using a manual jack which came with the car but be careful not to bend your frame while lifting.  How can you really knock this product tho at this cost when compared to any other jack on amazon.  It does the job, but I highly advise using jack stands irrespective of what lift you use.

I Installed the bag on my 2015 H-D Fat Boy. I didn't expect the 3 slot sets for the straps to line up exactly with my swing arm, the top (2) slot sets were pretty good, I should have used my Dremel Tool to make a new slot closer to the middle of the bag to line up with the lower bar of the swing arm. Pros are: The bag is a nice size to hold several items.  It fit the bike fine, still room for my throw over leather saddle bags & doesn't effect the passenger foot peg. The stiff plastic back works fine as support. I used the self adhesive plastic film that came with the bag on the swing arms. I could have used the (3) straps, but went with what others have recommended, use heavy duty zip strips, it secured the bag tighter & made up for the slight misalignment of the slot sets. Even though it is not leather, the strong synthetic material is sturdy enough & looks good (see the attached photos). The quick release buckle straps are nice & a good idea.  Cons are: The thick plastic back has sharp edges all the way around & on the backside of the (3) slot sets. The reason for 4 stars is because they manufactured the bag with rounded edges on the interior part of the (3) slot sets.  So I ended up using the Dremel tool to round all the edges, then even went one step further & secured a sheet of vinyl cloth to the entire back with contact cement & then cut slits where the prefab slots are. This was like having an additional benefit to aid the self adhesive plastic film cushion the bags back to the swing arm preventing any possible rubbing of the paint.  I am pretty satisfied with this Dowco "Willie & Max" swing arm bag & look forward to many years of use. Round the edges Dowco of your future bags & you definitely will earn 5 stars! Good job!

I purchased this for a John Deere ZTrak.  It mounts perfectly to the existing John Deere footrest holes with the included light hardware, and I was able to use&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/MICTUNING-MIC-B1002-LED-Light-Bar-Wiring-Harness-Fuse-40A-Relay-On-off-Waterproof-Switch/dp/B00O72R7Z8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">MICTUNING MIC-B1002 LED Light Bar Wiring Harness, Fuse 40A Relay On-off Waterproof Switch</a>&nbsp;to easily connect this to my battery routed along the frame.  Mowing grass in the heat of the day is not only less comfortable, but also takes precious time away that I could have spent with my kids.  With this light, I can mow any time I want.  The LEDs draw very little from the battery but provide outstanding lighting.  Between this light and the wire harness I spent ~$35 and an hour to install: that's worth every penny.

I was looking for a better solution to my key problem. Traditional keyrings leave a lot to be desired, especially when you need to remove or add a key. This system makes it easy. Use the smaller rings to group your keysets together. For instance, I put all the keys for a single car on a small ring, my house keys on another and my office keys on yet another. I also use a small ring for all those discount cards, Then it's easy to add and remove them when warranted.

I've been using this as a GPS mount for a few years now on my CBR 954rr with no problems. The rubber ball really grips good but the part that goes inside the steering stem is hard to get super tight, although it still stays in place. It seems to be very durable, I don't know how people are breaking theirs.

We bought a 2017 2.0 turbo Camaro and this fit perfect in the diff tunnel and hooked up to the tailpipes . You need to have a muffler shop do the welding to the tailpipes and the inlet . But VS paying $600 -$800 for after market stuff . No Drone not to load but sounds great and you really notice in the mid range it really hooks up . Plus it takes about 30 Lbs of the rear end .

Have anyone noticed the back of the new 2016 Pilot, there is a piece of chrome trim connecting 2 frog lights on the lower part of the back. Then I realized the lower part of the back of my 2014 Highlander was so bland, and I wished there was something there. While looking for leather seat cover for the car, Amazon also listed a bunch of other accessories, among them was this.It said only for 2015, However, I triple checked Highlander (built for US market), I found there were no change among 2014, 2015, and 2016 of North America region. 2014 Highlander built for China was still the previous generation. So I ordered it and I was right. It fits my 2014 Highlander. See pictures. Before installing them, the back of the vehicle looked so bland at lower part. After installing the pair, the lower part of the back are so much nicer. My car color is dark and that help they stand out even more. Now I think the back of my Highlander is much better than the back of the Pilot of 2016 and 2017,

Kept the net in our garage for about 2 months before finally installing it because we didn't have a drill to make holes in our Dodge Dakota 2000. Unfortunately, the screws it comes with do not drill sufficiently with a simple screwdriver. The worst part of the purchase was after installing it, the very next day I was adjusting the strap tension and the threading came loose and the strap snapped off. I am EXTREMELY disappointed in my purchase :(

Original: 10/NOV/2017Horrible... just put these on two cars (both use the 26" for the driver's side [09 Toyota Sienna, 13 Toyota Camry]).  Works great on the up-sweep, but horrible on the return sweep.  On both cars, right in the middle of the blade (so right in the middle of your field-of-view), it only squeegees clean on the up-sweep... on the return, it leaves a gap about 2"  wide of water...I had the Bosch ICON before, and they were great.  I thought I did an Amazon subscription for those 7 months ago, but apparently not... so, I'll be cancelling that subscription now.  With winter about to start, I foresee replacing these shortly.Update: 19/DEC/2017So the first storm I had to drive in with these was horrible.  This photo doesn't show just how hard it was to see through the MIDDLE of the windshield while trying to drive... I had to keep running the washer fluid to get that patch wet otherwise salty road spray was drying an opaque grey as it evaporated.I guess I got what I paid for with these...  true waste of money with this model.I just setup a new subscription for the ICONs I liked before--just hope I can make it through the next 5-weeks waiting for them...Update: 10/FEB/2018One last update on these: picture from 29/JAN... yes, it was a cold morning, but you can see in the animated GIF how these just didn't work in the middle... and that was just washer-fluid to get the water spots off... there are just horrible...  Got my ICONs, put them on both cars the day before a snow and ice-storm: not a problem--perfect sweep every time... even at 15F...

Product sold as new but was previously used! Packaging came with 2 adapters but one was missing an o-ring. Not only was the o-ring missing but the obviously dirty o-ring supplied is much bigger that the adapter could not fit without tearing the o-ring. The valves are scuffed with refrigerant leaking out of them.

I just installed these last weekend and am very pleased with them so far.  At the same time I replaced the end link bushings.  The thermoplastic bushings are a great upgrade over the standard elastomeric bushings.  These are similar to polyurethane bushings, except these supposedly don't need any grease to avoid squeaking.  I didn't want to chance it and have them squeak, so I applied minimal high temperature silicone grease which aids in assembly even if it isn't needed to avoid squeaking.

Used it to wrap an exhaust pipe header on a Honda 300EX quad. the pipe was getting too hot for my wife. This wrap not only helped control the heat (feels about 40% less) but also looks really nice. Easy to install. Be aware, the color will eventually fade out to a light black/ dark grey.

I gave my glass cleaning clay its first use today, and must say that I'm very impressed. I dare say the glass on my car is the cleanest it has ever been since it was virgin. After usual washing, I did the exterior glass with this clay, in conjunction with Griot's Speed shine, then wiped dry with a microfiber towel. I typically use Rain-X, but held off on application this time, thinking that the Speed Shine will provide similar protection. I used Invisible Glass to clean the interior glass, again wiping dry with a microfiber towel. Microfiber is excellent for this purpose. As you can see from the attached photo, my glass is nothing but reflections! It's difficult to imagine anything quicker, easier, less expensive, or more effective.  A friend dropped by while I was detailing, and her windshield was "clean", but still quite dirty. I did a 5-minute job on her front windshield, and she couldn't believe the difference. You won't go wrong with this product.

I was worried about the colors because the black one I chose was too black in the photo shown as I have a more dull toned down black leather. When I got it to my truck, I was shocked, it was an exact match as shown in the photo I am providing. ( I have a two tone seat with tan on black ) I was a little worried because the leather does not go all the way to the back of the gap but if something rolls off that far back at least it will just land on the back floorboard and not have to search under the seat. I only needed one but comes in a pack of two. I am constantly dropping change, cell phone or keys between the seat and finally gave in and got these and am glad I did.

Item arrived fast. Two stars off because of the manual. Item description is wrong and I have rubber pieces left that I don't know where they go or what are they for. M6X55 is a bolt, see the picture what it shows up as description vs. the figure. Never did an assembly of any kind of racks but took me 1 hr to put everything together.Update on the regview as of 6/7/2017. Yesterday tried to mount it on Golf MK6 but didn't work. The way that it is designed, won't let the door close, also as per 1 page in instructions, says rain channel, nowaday cars have no rain channel on the top...Waste of my money.

Very dissatisfied with this product and Opt-7 as a company. I purchased these bulbs 2 years ago here through Amazon. When I first received the bulbs(H11) I was super excited to get them installed. They looked heavy duty, fancy aluminum housing, fan, all things that make you think "quality". Sadly "quality" is the last thing these lights are. Upon first installing my new led headlights (which is a pain, considering the front bumper has to be removed on my car to replace the headlights) I noticed this almost rainbow type ring around the upper outside edge of both the lights. I then decided to drive the car around at night. They seemed pretty bright, but only up to 7 feet or so in front of the car, beyond that, blackness. Being able to see that short distance in front of you makes driving dark country roads almost impossible. I immediately emailed Opt-7 explaining to them the issue I was having with the light, even emailed them photos of the rainbow edge around the lights( if I can find the photos I sent opt-7 of that rainbow edge, I'll upload them). I was concerned maybe I received defective bulbs. To my dismay, Opt-7 was less than helpful. The representative told me that basically they thought I wasn't being honest and they never had any issues with there bulbs before. I told him, why would I lie? I wasn't looking for a handout. I just wanted to return the bulbs I had for a refund or replacement. They blatantly refused any type of exchange or refund. At this point I was just frustrated with my lights and the company in general. I ended up just leaving the lights in the car for the next two years. Here's my reasoning. It's a major pain in the you know what to change these bulbs,due to the aforementioned front bumper. Also we barely drive the car especially at night, I think 15,000 miles in two years.Fast forward from October 2015( when I bought the Opt-7 H11 bulbs) to October 2017. We took a family vacation and decided to take our Fusion, the car I have these lights installed on. I like driving at night when  there is no traffic. These lights were absolutely terrible. I'm surprised we made it through the dark back country roads without a catastrophic accident. I decided once I get home I'm replacing the bulbs with new ones. My family safety is more important than these bulbs.Upon our return home I go to the nearest autoparts store. I tell them briefly, the problem I'm having and asked for the brightest headlights they have. They sold me Sylvania Super Ultra Night, and all I have to say is wow. We can see so much more of the road. For half the price of these led bulbs, I got 4x the brightness.This leads me to my next point. They claim to use Cree led chips. I'm suspect they use some Chinese knock off's. As you can see in the pictures I just took when I pulled the lights out, that the leds appear to be burned out. This is a HUGE concern considering they really haven't been used all that much. Like I said 15,000 miles in two years. That's not a lot of driving. I expected a lot more from this company especially after all the claims they make and the price they set them at, $100+.Make your own decision on whether or not to purchase these. I just know I've had problems with these and the company from the moment I installed them. I would never do business with this company again.On a side note, I also suspect some of these high ranking reviews are fake. Either by company employees or paying people, with money or free products, to write positive reviews of the Opt-7 products. I can't prove it, but just a feeling.

Was excited when this riding pants arrived. Everything from stitching, materials and padding seemed to be spot on perfect. The feel inside and outside was nice and soft.Then the disappointment came, from trying them on. I wear a size 38 waist and 36 inseam, 6' 4" at 240 lbs. And I did order the Bilt size 38 grey cargo pants. Unfortunately, the sizing was way off. The label on the pants indicated the were 38's and regular length, but my honest opinion was that they felt like 36. Had they been true 38's I would have keeped them and though the length was short for me, my riding boots would have taken care of that difference. So unfortunately, I believe they may have been mislabled or their sizing is way off. Basically, if you're a rider that is a true size 34-36 with at most a 32 inseam, then this size pants are perfect for you.I would wish their sizing was accurate or else it would have been a 5 star review.Also if they gave you the option for TALL on the inseam, they would be able to open the doors to the tall rider's.

As an avid DIYer, having the right tools really helps. Cheaping out on a $15 tool can mean the difference of having a scratch free surface vs having a nasty scratch you'll be looking at for the next five years when you're in the car.

I own Volvo 245DL with rare Alloy Virgo wheels.This stuff works, but not on very old baked dirt/brake dust.Usually I use 1-2 cans of brake cleaner(cost around $6 compare to this $19 product) once a year to clean my wheels and get the same result or maybe better.1) Did it in the evening, made sure wheels are cold and sprayed them with water.2) Applied medium layer of the product and let it sit for 3-5 minutes.3) Rubbed wheels with clean sponge for dishes "for the best results".4) Sprayed with water hose under decent pressure.5) It did clean major stuff, but the deep stuff stayed there and I only tried this product because of that.I expected for $19 and such advertisement that this product finally would clean deep old baked crap of my wheels, but it didn't.I messaged CarGuys and they responded me in 10-20 minutes with polite email that they will issue me a full refund. In about two hours I got notification that i'm getting my refund.TL;DR I used 1/3 of the bottle and it wasn't as good as advertised, but i got full refund with no hassle.Once again, IT WORKS, but not as you would expect from $19 bottle and such extreme advertising. In addition, you get great customer service. Attached photos.

The lights themself are amazingly bright and will get you noticed.  I would have given the product a 5 star review had the shroud been of decent quality.  There's some nice flash patterns you can use as well as the pattern that leaves the clear light on with the red flashing which is helpfull when you're on the scene.  First of all, the shroud really didn't seem to go with the light with it's attachments tabs or the quality of plastic they were each made of.  After nearly 30 minutes of trying to get it to click into place, it finally stayed attached.  Two days after I purchased this light, the shroud was deformed from the heat in my vehicle which is parked in a garage when I'm at home and in a shaded area four hours a day.  I know vehicles can get hot in the summertime but two other light's shrouds in the vehicle were unphased by the heat.  Until I can get a replacement shroud or have one made, I could only suggest people purchase this with a vehicle with a nearly vertical windshield such as a jeep. The warping may not seem like that big of a deal but this light is so bright, I'm blinded by it while driving at night.

Bought this for my 03 Forester. I found it very easy to assemble, of decent quality (can't comment on longevity), and also easy to install. The instructions are quite good. I drove to work today doing 70mph and noticed no additional noise or rattles, and the rack stays firmly in place. It looks great too. I recommend having some silicone spray grease handy for the rubber gaskets that cover where the tubes of the rack meet during assembly. The instructions read "Use rubber safe lube on gaskets" - this is not included. The wind shield is plastic, by the way. I'm tempted to run without to make it easier to transport skis and such.Edit. Review changed to 4 stars. Works great, but after some rain and snow there are rust droplets all over my roof. Gonna have to paint with some rust proofing to get this up to snuff.

I ordered it wednesday with 2 day shipping and it took a week to get here only reason im giving it 4 starts. But the product is great! If youve never installed vinyl before then youll have a hard time with corners but if you have a heat gun it makes it 100 times easier. Product looks good and has a nice shine to it. It stuck very well didn't have a problem with that just make sure u clean the area first. All in all defenitly a great product for the price i wpuld defenitly recommend.

These arms appear to be heavier duty than OEM parts. Hardware fit fine except for 1 bolt, it had a raised area where the threads end on the bolt. It was just a matter of grinding it down just a lil bit to get it to go thru all the way.Just an FYI...2002 expedition (and possibly other models or years) the left side front bolt can only be removed 2 ways. Remove the gas tank or cut the bolt at the head side.  I chose to cut it off, also when installing arm, fasten the front part of it 1st then the rear. It will make it easier to push/pry to get holes to line up & get bolt thru.

It gets inside lug nut holes, valve stems, through spokes to clean calipers, between the lip of the rim and tire, and even the print on the tire itself.  It worked great with purple cleaner to remove brake dust.  My Evo X has the build quality of 3rd world plumbing, and so the factory aero kit has a bunch of crevices where the side skirts are riveted to the body.  The painted joined surfaces are inside the wheel wells where they catch a lot of brake dust, and those brakes generate LOTS of dust.  With some lathered soap for lubrication, i was finally able to get all of that dust out without fear of scratching up the paint.  Semi-metallic brake dust is very abrasive.  I also used it to clean the emblems which provided a nice touch to a detailed clean look.A high end single brand dealership i worked for used similar brushes to clean wheels and I could never find one at auto parts stores.  These brushes are of pretty good quality.  As with any car cleaning tool, the brush is a consumable so don't expect it to last forever, although i was surprised to see there was no shedding of bristles.  I will be purchasing a couple more of these.

The back rain guards that were sent are the wrong size, they are way too long and do not fit. Part of one of the front rain guards glue came off when pulling the red string. Glue looks very old and doesn't seem very strong. Another guard had a scuff on the outside. Very disappointed with this product. I'm going to return it or have the item replaced.

Kinda cheaply made, but.. what else is there?! the zipper part on my passanger side window kinda ripped a bit, but it is not too bad and the velcro was good enough to to make sure it didn't leak.  I also bought a new bow and also bought new hardware and also the weather stripping thing above the windshield to make my installation happen.outside of that.. what else is there to get for the suzuki samurai!!!I also love the safari mode you can set this to, and uninstall the 2 windows and the rear window

Great tool for Yamaha R3 riders.Only problem with the kit the included hardware will NOT fit our bikes.You will need M6x50mm 12.9 Alloy Steel Screw Cap Point Hex Socket Screws.  Can get them on Amazon or a local hardware store to install.This mount works great with the long or short mount, then adding the Ram mount for phone, or even the camera mount for tossing a camera on the bike real quick.  If you add the short mount plus the phone holder, it will still clear the yamaha R3 small tank bag if you want to toss a camera on and put the phone in the tank bag etc etc.

So this thing comes with 2 drawstrings that don't loosen enough to get it over the winch. It has slots cut in the front that should be in the back to allow room for the wires to pass through. I cut one of the cords and used a little bungie cord and mounted the cover backwards. After those modifications it is removed easily and quickly. The material has stood up to 5 months of Alaska winter with some F2 vinyl protector so I would say it is sturdy. As well as staying on firmly. I will attach some pics. Don't buy this and expect to use it as it comes, you will be wanting a refund.

It's really useful to make the scratch disappear. But before you use it, you have to clean your vehicle first because some solid dirt or something can't be removed by this product. According to the appearance of the product I received, I cancelled one star. Btw, you can find in the picture the part where covered by the wax is different from others

I bought 2 of these Battery Tenders because they said (115 volt - 50/60 HZ) on them. I opened one to try it out and it lasted about 20 seconds and then I heard a pop sound and the unit stopped working, lights went out on unit. The other one I have not open up yet. Trying to have Battery tender explain to me what happened. Will properly have to send both units back to Amazon.com for credit.

First I am new to the spray game and have no plans to be a professional. While the idea of replaceable/ disposable  parts sounds good so you can save money on solvent and keep from buying multiple guns .  It's clear that you will exceed the cost of a couple of quality guns in short order if your using this thing on a regular basis.My first set of guns was from HF 3 gun kit nothing fancy but but cost less and sprayed consistent. The 3m gun I had to keep changing my technique  (what little I have). I found as the liner got pulled down the vacuum it created would slow the paint/material  from entertaining the spray nozzle.  It did lay down a high build primer nice but (1.8) but I could not get it to lay down base or a top coat worth a damn using the 1.3 or 1.4.  Will update if I figure out how to make it work.  Pic is after a partial wet sand and buff have a lot more sanding to go to make acceptable

Bought this product from eBay because I found it there cheaper. But me and a friend got it installed in a little over an hour. I put it on my GMC 2014 Sierra Crew Cab and it looks great. It's only slightly higher in the front then it is in the back (7/16"). I'm very satisfied with how it looks. It shipped in 3 days. We also didn't have to grind the existing studs down in the strut, which was nice. Price, shipping, easy install, boils down to 5 stars in my book. My only criticism would be the fact that they don't provide any flat washers or any lock washers in the hardware kit. I put both on mine because for the six flat and lock washers I paid $1.54, so it was well worth it.

this thing looks great, operates well, and is very clean and professional looking! As others have said, they needed the larger of the two switches offered by Oznium. I was very happy i heeded these reviews because my finger slightly fits in the Larger 25MM housing, and i believe the smaller switch would have been almost impossible to fit my finders in to operate.

This set of decals are adorable but are a bit hard to apply. There are no directions so you have to make sure that you apply the stickers using the sticky side of the sheet otherwise the product won't stick. But once you take about 5 minutes to apply the decals to back of your rear view mirror it looks so unique and cool. Unfortunately I got this set of black decals and didn't realize that my rear view was black, so I applied the decals to my mom's car. I plan on getting a white set for myself though!

Great product.  Installed manual lock in under 2 hours.  Works nice, now not as worried about stuff in my HR '13.  As others said the instructions are minimal and pics too small.  Did view you tube video from etrailer and that was excellent.  Did run into one problem.  The 'lock bar' was manufactured in the incorrect orientation.  After viewing video and looking at manufacture pics it was evident it had been put together in wrong orientation.  I tried several ways to do per directions but no go.  So I removed rivet and corrected orientation and it worked fine.  Don't know if this was me or just incorrect manufacturing.  Otherwise great product.

I received two of these today, and they were both made in Mexico. I am not sure if the quality, and past experience of this product is good enough for keeping something I still believed was made here in the USA. In fact I plan on calling K and N because their website still has the pictures (like Amazon) of being an American-made good.

We just purchased a 2008 CR-V EX-L and I read that there was an air filter for the cabin.  After looking this up I found this filter on Amazon and it has worked nicely.  The old filter was not that dirty but because it is a used vehicle I wanted to change it.  Wife and kids drive the car mostly.Installation: (SEE PICTURES ABOVE FOR STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS)This was ridiculously easy to install.  On the 2008 CR-V you just open the glove box.  On the right hand side of the glove box is a latch with a hook.  Just un-hook this latch and the glove box will drop.  Then just push in the top sides of the glove box and it will drop completely exposing the filter area.  Now, just look up inside and you will see the filter.  It is rectangle in shape and has two clips - one on the left and one on the right.  Just push these clips inward and pull at the same time.  The filter tray will slide out.  Take the old filter out of the tray, replace with new, slide back inside and make sure you hear the clips snap.  Then put the glove box back in place (reverse previous steps) and you are good to go!PROS:Fits perfectEasy to install - 3 minutes topsCharcoal/baking soda nice added featureSAVES MONEY - Dealer fees HIGH!CONS:NONE

These mud flaps are awesome! I kept coating my camper with mud any time there was a little moisture on a dirt road.I had two initial concerns...1. Are these big enough to make a difference- Yes! They are not too big, but seem to be just right.2. I imagined I would buy like rubber flaps, I wonder if these will get smashed up while driving on backroads to get to the remote camping sites my family likes to go to. - Answer: I am still a little worried about that, They have been fine so far, but I do worry in just the wrong situation they could take a hard hit and destroy them.I was impressed with these though overall, install was pretty easy, took me about 30 to 45 minutes, but now that I have done it before I could knock it out in about 15 to 20. Anybody can install these, so if your hesitant, don't be. They come with fantastic directions, everything you need for install and its really just pretty easy. The only tools you will need is a socket, to remove two existing bolts on the wheel well on each side in the front, a screw driver, 1/8" drill bit, a rag to clean the paint (comes with protective covering for the body paint)

These are exactly what I expected to receive. All of the LEDs worked perfectly when plugged in. They are white light and very bright it is a very noticeable  difference between the LEDs and filament bulbs that were factory  as you can see in the picture.  I obviously haven't had them long enough to see the life expectancy of them but I am very happy with the purchase so far.

This stuff is amazing! I had a chirping sound in my 03 excursion 6.0 that I couldn't figure out. Heard everything from belt and pulleys, to oil veins in the turbo clogged up and the air was making the sound. But after first day of using ar9100 the sound stopped. Great product,  saved me a ton of money trying to figure out what that annoying little sound was. Started using the fuel additive the same day also, I definitely recommend both products for 6.0 powerstrokes especially!

I think that I paid twenty two dollars and change for a set of four at the time of purchase. How an you really go wrong with that. I've been using them for almost two months without any issues. I bought a set of four of the same light last year and they're still going strong. I broke one bracket on one and that was my fault. I bought four more because to buy a new mount was twenty dollars. Add two more and I got four more lights and I like lights lol. I'd buy these all day long for that price.

This may well be the single best product I've ever purchased online. That's no hyperbole. I bought this back in 2008. I've used it literally every day, for over 100,000 road miles. It has sat in the car in the desert heat, Great Plains freezing winter, humidity, dry air, you name it. Not had a single problem once.So why the review now? I don't know what the payback is on this, but I can tell you just know my driving habits and seeing, real time, my fuel economy, has saved my at least 10% on my fuel bills. Back when gas was hitting $4 a gallon, this thing was like a license to steal. Over 8 years, if I spent an estimated $6500 on fuel, and the ScanGauge has helped my get at least 8% better economy, over $500 in fuel alone. This doesn't take into account the reduced wear on my brakes and tires, either.In the manual there's a section on adding custom codes and displays. I set mine up, as you'll see in the picture, with the air intake temp, the water temp of the engine, the overall trip fuel economy (shown as --- since I'm not driving) and the instantaneous MPG (0.0 since car is stopped.)While you drive, you can quickly glance down on and see realtime MPG. I also like the cost per mile and overall trip cost functions. If you drive stupid, you can literally see how much money you're burning.As far as a code reader goes, yes, it can pull codes off the engine and reset them. It will not do any kind of SRS or Airbag codes, I've learned. I've only ever had one code pop on the engine, and it was a fluke.I don't see how you can justify NOT getting one of these. The quality is absolutely on point perfect, and payback period is maybe 2-3 years for the average person. But that aside, you're driving more safely, using less fuel, not wearing out your car, and saving money.

First of all, the reviews for this product are kinda confusing - it kinda looks like one or two other items have reviews that are all part of this group.I was looking for some stainless hooks for a bathroom refresh we've been working on.  The package contained 4 hooks like the attached picture (for clarity, in case the ad changes again) and they appear to be decent stainless steel hooks, which is good for a higher-humidity environment I suppose.  They don't have DefenderX engraved on them, so that must be a photoshop trick of some kind.  The hooks alone are pretty decent, look nice and feel pretty sturdy.The mounting hardware, as I kind of suspected, is pretty minimal.  I've never had any luck with the hammer-in drywall anchors and relegated them to the trash can right off the bat, opting to use threaded anchors instead.  The screws weren't too bad, I don't know that I trust them to hold concrete blocks or anything, but they're okay.In the picture, you see the intended mounting system consisting of the included screws, a rubber or plastic piece that holds the head of the screw, and a steel cap that hides the screw and plastic piece.  This, unfortunately, seems to be the failing point of the equation - putting the screw in tight enough to make the hook feel sturdy made the plastic piece split, which in turn made the cap not fit.  If you didn't care about the cap, these would be good, probably a 4 star product (taking away a star since you still don't get high quality hardware to mount them) but if you want them to look good, you need to go reallllllllly easy on the screw tightening so you don't crack that plastic.  So for me, 3 stars.  I did receive a discount on the wall mount hooks in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, which you read above.If you found this review helpful, click below to let me know!

I'd seen a few folks on car forums talking about these Japanese air fresheners. We have a 2001 Volvo S60 which (as all of these seem to) has an odor that you can't get rid of, it's an old plastic smell that some have compared to melted crayons. I think it comes from the foam padding on the carpet as it ages but wherever it is you cannot get rid of it easily.I decided to purchase these. They are much larger than I thought, I figured they were the size of a tin of mints but they are actually closer to the size of a VHS tape. Anyway, size doesn't matter in this situation since I just slid one under the passenger seat in the Volvo. At first I thought the smell was a too strong but you get used to it. It's been in the car a couple of months now and I no longer notice the bad odor so that is a thumbs up in my book.

I installed these lights on my 1986 Ford Bronco II.  I wanted something that looked correct for the vintage of vehicle.  Most of the new lights look too "high tech".  Installation was straight forward.  While the supplied wire appeared too fine of a gauge, it has been more than adequate.  The lights are bright and focused.  The bases lack notches to hold them firmly into the aligned position, so when servicing the engine, it is easy to bump them and knock them out of horizontal alignment.  Overall, I am pleased with how they look and how they function, and would buy again.

I have several dial (analog bourdon tube) gauges to measure tire pressure, plus a Milton inflater with a built-in gauge.  My (GM) car also has TPMS.  My service dept claims the TPMS is accurate to within about 1lb.  This Accutire gauge is in exact agreement with the TPMS in the car, and one of the dial gauges.  The other gauge and the inflater are about 2lbs off.  With dial type gauges, some interpretation is required at times depending on the divisions of the scale.  The 2 dial gauges I have use 2lb divisions.  So if the pointer is somewhere between 34 & 36lbs, is it 35, or 34.5?  This is why I wanted a digital gauge.Having 4 gauges all reading within 2lbs of each other is very reassuring.  This digital gauge seems to be very accurate.  The metal housing allows a firm grip, and should stand up to continued use.  It uses commonly available CR2023 batteries which are replaceable.  It does NOT have a lifetime lithium battery.The flaws are minor, thus my 4-star rating.  As other reviewers stated, the LED light is not very useful, but you can just ignore this by not pushing the flashlight button.  The tire valve chuck also does take a little getting used to, as others have said.  But it's not that hard, and with a few tries, you can get a reliable seal and accurate reading.The other thing is that you must hold the gauge on the tire valve for 1 or 2 seconds for it to "lock-in."  I've found that you can push the gauge on the valve and get a reading, but if you don't wait long enough it goes back to zero immediately after removing the gauge.  By keeping the gauge on for a second or 2, the pressure reading is retained for about 10 seconds, making it much easier to read.  The instructions that come with the gauge state this is a feature to "zero" the gauge to ensure accuracy.

After seeing a bunch of 'did not work' type negative reviews for this which I felt it did no do this scratch remover justice, I felt that I had to chime in . In short whether you just like to take care of your car or a diehard enthusiast this is one item every car owner needs to have at hand. If you are determined enough and put enough sweat and effort into it the ScratchX will remove almost any clearcoat scratch which has not penetrated the basecoat paint or hide it enough to make it almost invisible without causing damage to your paint. In fact I documented the step by step process how it virtually disappears a deep clear coat scratch (see pics) with enough effort and applicationsUSING IT & RECOMMENDATIONS- So you have a nasty scratch (from keys, jeans , road chip or a paint transfer mark) that you want to get rid of. Well this is the right product alright but here's the catch - It is going to take TONS and TONS of concentrated effort on your part ( i literally felt like my arms are going to fall off!) . And get rid of the scratch it will !- I *HIGHLY* recommend getting a soft terry towel cloth applicator( which I got from the dollar store)  for this scratch remover as it works better  when compared to a sponge applicator ( i found this the hard way) . The slight abrasiveness of the terry cloth along with the scratch remover work together better- After cleaning the area you want you work on thoroughly, You'll want to put *significant* pressure in buffing the paste perpendicular to the scratch surface in order to cut it down and bring it in level to the nearby surface . Keep in mind that this paste only works with clear coat scratches and paint transfer marks- As you can see from my pics I had a pretty deep clear coat scratch that was likely caused by jeans with a deep cut and sharp edges- It took me 4 painstaking applications and lots of sweat/effort but as you can see that the scratch progressively starts blending in until it is totally gone by the fourth application- Once you are reasonably satisfied wipe the area with a damp cloth to remove the remains , follow up with a paste wax to finish your surface-  You might come across online articles and videos about using 3000 & 5000 grit sandpaper for removing deeper scratches .. However I did not feel comfortable using sandpaper on my new car . And you can definitely remove deep scratches with a terry applicator and this paste alone - Just that it is going to take a boatload of effort and sore arms ....but bottom line it does get the job done! I have used it to remove lots of nicks, scuffs and chip marks all around my carFINAL THOUGHTSI couldn't be happier with the results I got with the ScratchX , it is almost like magic. Granted that you might loose your arms in the process :) but it WILL remove that scratch on your ride that's been bothering you !!!  Highly Recommended for every car lover !

These should NOT be sold as fog light bulbs. They plug in and fit in the fog light of my 17 F150.  But the design of them throws light straight out with the led'salso in the tip of the bulb. The factory bulbs are coated on the tip not to have output like that. there was not cutoff with these.The picture on the left is the stock fog light output.The one on the right is the JDM . It turns your foglights into crappy driving lights .

They went on fine and was easy with the provided tool.  And all metal.  Great!  TIP: When using the tool push the spring to attach from the bottom of the hook not the top.  If you use the top to attach it will just bend and be difficult to attach.

I received mine without the bumper pieces which go on each end of the plastic connecting pieces you see in the center. I wrote an email to AMP Researchs customer service and in less than 10 hours received a response, stating theyve already processed my request, and less than 24 hours later received an email with a FedEx tracking number for two day shipping from the West Coast to the East Coast. Unbelievably great customer service.Installation was simple. I used the method others suggested in these reviews, versus using the companys paper templates included with the installation directions. I put together the entire assembly: rested the brackets on the extender, and put it in place to mark the locations to  drill my holes.Everything looks great. Im excited to have this extender for when I need to haul my motorcycles anywhere with my Tacoma.

They're small and they stick well. Perfect for what I wanted. They are plastic, not aluminum.

Fits a 2015 Nissan Frontier Crew Cab just fine. Like others have said you get several adapters to fit various thread sizes. Love the low profile look. Will make windshield cleaning much easier. We live about 30 miles from any radio station, and I didn't notice any signal degredation. The FM stations I listen to come in just fine. Can't yet say if signals will be lost sooner on road trips. Happy with this purchase.

I know the photos I took were taken at night but I was so excited I couldn't help myself. I got an src stinger bumper and boy did it cover my jeep completely. I was a little confused on how it went on the vehicle but I figured it out after moving it around. It rained over night and when I took it off this morning before going to work my car was 100% dry under the cover. I give 2 thumbs up to this cover. I don't even think I need the bungee cords to hold it down. Thanks!

Very nice bright white light.  Bought these at the same time as "GM Chevrolet Chevy Camaro Daytime Running Light DRL / Fog Light Plug and Play Adapter Harness 2010 2011 2012 2013 by Clipsandfasteners Inc".  Combo works great!

These wheels get compliments everywhere I go it seems,they are a lot lighter than the factory wheels and at under $100 bucks per wheel ($94) I am feeling zero guilt about this purchase. They changed the whole dynamics of My 2002 Ford Explorer xlt as far as curb appeal and performance is concerned. I will attach a before and after photos so you can see for your selves.

Needed some better LEDs for my license plate and these work great. The product pic shows white lights, the ones I got were black but it wasn't an issue. These are nice and bright, a little long though. Also if you're looking for white white (like 5000k-ish) these aren't it, more like around 6000k so there's a blueish tint to them.

I installed this in my 2002 BMW 325ci 2.5L a few months ago.  It solved the false low oil warning light which was great.  I just investigated the source of an oil leak on my car and found that this unit was leaking.  It wasn't leaking from the sealing gasket but was leaking from the base of the electrical connector.  I have ordered another one since the price was cheap and I didn't see any other reviews about oil leaks.  I'm hoping that this is a one off problem and the next one doesn't leak.  I will be keeping a close eye on it once I receive the next one and it is installed.Update: March 1, 2018I just installed the second oil level sensor from the same Amazon retailer a couple days ago.  All went well in the install and no leaks anywhere at this time.  The gasket sealed perfectly as it did with the first one I installed.  There is no leakage at the electrical connection as happened with the last one but only time will tell if it will happen again.  I'm hoping I just got a bad unit and this one will not leak over time.  It definitely solved the false low oil yellow warning issue so I'm very pleased with that.  I'm going to upgrade my rating from two stars to 4 stars and if it isn't leaking in a few months from now I will increase it to five stars.  The price is certainly right and it functions nicely.  I don't like to be unfair to a seller with my ratings so I have given them a second chance.

These small cans of Rust bullet go further than one might think! Plus let it be known, Rust Bullet can't be opened then closed again unless you have on hand some other product to slow the curing of it. I forget what it's called. This product sprays best out of my primer gun(HVLP), slightly diluted with Rust bullets "thinner". Anyway, the little cans are great and I don't waste my larger cans of it. I'll be buying more to have on hand~! The picture of the frame was brushed on, the Trailing arms were sprayed followed by Rust Bullet clear. Thanks!

Vehicle: 2000 Acura IntegraDenso typically names great products for Honda's and I tried to save a few bucks by changing out my OEM Honda spark plug wires with these Denso ones but they have already warped for some reason. Take a look at the attached photo. Spark plug wire 4 is bubbling and spark plug wire 1 is distorted on the inside. The other 2 look okay, however spark plug wire 2 doesn't "pop" when you push it back into the engine. Maybe I received a bad product? I should also mention the wires aren't as beefy as the OEM Honda ones. The gauges are most likely different.For those that are curious, @ 249,511 miles I inserted these denso wires with:- beck arnley valve cover gasket- ngk laser platinum spark plugsIt now has 256,192 miles on it. So the plugs warped within 6,681 miles.

The quality of the cable and clamps is okay, not great. I would not want to use these in a shop or on a regular basis, but for once in a blue moon needs, it'll do. I wanted the low gauge and long length to accommodate several long vehicles we have, but that's the biggest plus for these cables. If you want a high quality set, spend more.But you may need to spend more anyway - if you want the bag. I received one, but it pulled apart at the seams after the very first use. (See picture.) I may buy a battery cable bag (which you really need for one of this size and length) which makes the cost a lot more.So the value just isn't there.

First, the light seems to be high quality. I'll update later after I see how it lasts. It's sturdy, heavy, and the harness that comes with it is well-built. I especially like the understated red led on the switch. It shows when the light is on (as if you wouldn't know) without lighting up the truck cab. The light itself is very bright and I like the flood/spot combination. With this light on it makes the headlights look like old flashlights.Someone asked if it would fit in the bumper space on a 2013 F150. Someone replied that it will fit. That's not exactly correct - it can be MADE to fit. The light itself is too wide to fit in the bumper space. If you then add the width of the supplied mounting brackets it is even wider. Also, those brackets won't work due to the fact they are unidirectional (they have to turn outward, not inward when mounting). I did mount mine in the bumper space (photo 1). However, I had to make my own mounting brackets (photo 2) and had to trim the inside edges of the plastic bumper pads to fit around the ends of the light. If you're wanting to go with a "no cut" fit, you'll need to find a 20 inch light or a 20.5 inch that doesn't mount to the sides.Some have mentioned the lights leak. I drove through the rain on a few occasions so far and have had no signs of water in the light.In general, no matter your application, keep in mind the light is 22 inches, but when you add the width of the brackets it's wider.

Bought a pack of these T10 194 LEDs as I wanted to replace the original courtesy lights on my 2013 Genesis Coupe. My car came with red lenses so I replaced them today with clear lenses and it shows off the brightness of these LEDs nicely. They're not extremely bright but they illuminate a pure white light as advertised. Now I have 8 spare LEDs to use in case my  other interior lights go out. At a little more than $1 per bulb, I am pleased with them.

I try to change the air filters once a year. Purchased this WIX filter last year through a local auto supply house for a 2003 Honda. This year purchased an off brand through eBay. (See Photos Uploaded) Last years WIX had 45 pleats while this year's eBay off brand purchase had 29 pleats. The photo of this WIX filter from Amazon shows only 40 pleats?Count them when you receive your filter. Another reviewer for a Purolater Classic also noticed that the Purolater he purchased from Amazon has only 29 pleats when compared to the OE filter he removed from his Honda which had double the number of pleats. Name brands are buying cheaper units and putting them in their boxes as their own it seems?

Pros:Great Brightness level vs OEMColor - Bright even distrusted diamond white with a small hit of blue. Colors match most LED daytime running lights on cars today.Easy to install in a H11 socketImages of what these look like installed are attachedCons:None so far for myself. The LED housing is much bigger then halogen bulbs so these may not work in all cars.Installed:2015 CRV the install could not have been easier.Summary:Buy these if you want the HID look without the use of ballastsInstall Tips:A simple test is to disconnect your headlight wire, turn your lights on and see if your daytime running lights are still on. If they are on, your probably good, if not, you would need a canceler cable.

I've been using these for about a month now and felt the need to write a review! So far they have been great, the color is on point, and the brightness is impressive. Other people saying the color isn't the one they ordered don't understand HID lights have a "burn in time" and need several hours of use before they turn to the color you ordered. I ordered 8000k, they started very white light and over time they got the hint of blue I was wanting! Also both sides match each other perfectly and I am not getting any flickering. Will buy again! Also these are installed in a Ford F250 7.3L diesel (two batteries) DC 35w ballast.

I got this Spartan helmet decal for my brother. He has placed it on his motorcycle helmet. He was super excited whenever I gave it to him. The colors run very well together. I love the black and grey with the blue stripe, it really makes the decal like pop out. You can see every detail to a T on the decal. While going too restaurant driving by my brother on his motorcycle I could see the decal clearly and being 2 lanes away. The decal is very easy to apply. Make sure you wash the surface first so it will stick properly. It looks clean and sharp on his helmet. It is big enough to notice but not to large to take up the whole helmet. As well its nice being able to support American and law enforcement at the same time. Great product and awesome find. I got this product for free in exchange for my honest review.

*** Revised/ Edit:I contacted the Seller - Amazon. Within 12 hours, a replacement product was processing/ shipped/ and delivered within 2 business days. They could not ship the broken component independently, so the entire product was replaced. It looks/ feels identical to the original. I'm hoping this one lasts longer than 3 months.Great Customer Service! Upgraded to 3 Stars. I will reassess/ re-review this again in 3-6months - or earlier IF i have any issues.Original Review: The rubber on the clamps has torn in less than 3 months of use. I've used this for 3 months in my JK, with my Samsung Note 3. I was not using a case, just my phone. Now the rubber on the clamps won't hold my phone making this mount useless to me. I will reach out to the seller and update this review as progress or lack thereof occurs.

For the price these are good bags. Im happy as they do what I want and that is to carry stuff from stores and some things I might need. The only thing that I want to tell anyone that puts them on a Yamaha V Star 250, mine is a 2014, is that you MUST relocate the turn signals to make them fit. I did this without drilling another hole in the fender by using a luggage rack I had put on when I bought the bike. It had a curved hole on the side that with a large flat washer, and a lock washer, worked. I attached a photo of the set up. Today the bags were put to the test as I brought home Chinese take out including soup in them.  It did take some time adjusting the straps, and moving the signals thats why the four stars.  I'm sure these will work out fine and I like the yellow rain covers.

I've had this for 8 months now.The can is nice machined aluminum, the hose is a joke which takes a 1/2 start from it.I just picked up some 3/8" fuel line at the auto parts store. No baffles so I stuffed a couple stainless steel scrubbing pads in it and added a short piece of brass tubing to one of the inlet/outlet fittings so it can't just suck contaminates stright into the return side.I was concerned the viewibng tube fittings might leak vacuum as they are just plastic fittings, but so far they aren't sucking airI fabricated my own braket.I've seen this exact same can under otherbrand names sell for twice as much as this one.

This is a great value and incredibly easy to install. I put these on my 2017 F-150. It took 2 minutes. The bulb sockets unscrew with a quarter turn, pull the old bulbs, insert these beauties and reinstall sockets. The pic shows the factory bulb on the left vs this bulb on the right. Incredible.

I purchased these replacements for my Honda for two reasons- one being the Wagner brand and two because they were prepainted to keep from rusting.  As it turns out the disc still shows rust because some of the surface of the disc is still bare metal ( see pic).  Other brands such as Duralast which I hate paints the entire rotor, not sure why Wagner didn't.  I knew what the rotor looked like from the pictures but didn't think twice about the braking surface portion of the rotor rusting.  Still a good smooth disc but paid extra for the painted version to avoid the rust showing.  Btw these rotors were matched with Wagner ceramic brake pads which I have installed

Perfectly fits my 2015 Mazda 3 iTouring hatchback. Easy to install without drilling. Added a very sporty look better than OEM at very reasonable price. OEM parts cost more than 4x and require installation which costs $250.00 at Galpin Mazda. The metal and rubber materials are of good quality. The rubber does not have a bad smell. The free shipping was also quick and had a good packaging to protect the items from accidental damage. I hope there are other good quality products for Mazda 3. Thank you.

So, I was in need of an upgrade to a rear hitch bumper step I had installed on an old Chevy Silverado 12+ years ago. That step migrated over to my 2006 Denali and although it still worked, I wanted something sleeker, longer and a bit more "updated."So, these trailer lights became incorporated with a separate aluminum rear hitch step I purchased. The reviews I read before purchase made it sound like these were pretty reliable and bright,....and thus far THEY ARE. They look great on the sleek bumper hitch step I bought and wiring them in was a snap.Although I'm not sure if they're water proof, They have been submerged for a short period (less than 10 seconds) during the storm (Hurricane Mathews) when it came through the Carolinas. Still working like a champ!!!I've added a few photos of how I utilized them and the end product.The price was reasonable, delivery was fast and I'm VERY satisfied with my end product. I now have a trailer that needs re-wiring and I believe I'll use these lights for that project as well.

I received this jack In The Box system for my boat that is a little old and never equipped with a jack or lug wrench. The Extreme Max system is a very good idea because no worries about did you remember to bring the jack or lug wrench in the truck? It is very heavy duty and mount's on most trailer frames as there is two size U-clamps and nuts supplied to mount it. I mounted mine on the right front and I was afraid it would look weird and stand out like a sore thumb but it actually look's nice. When mounted it is very secure and comes with a sliding bar that goes in front of the cover and can also use a lock to keep from being stolen. The jack and lug tools fit nice and snug in it's enclosure. I have it mounted far enough forward so that I do not think water will get into it while loading or unloading the boat in the lake.  For me this is a great tool and possible life saver because before this I did not have any tools incase of a flat tire so Im good now. I would for sure recommend this to anyone that does not have a jack solely with the boat. Thanks and hope this helps.

I swear I got this the next day! Very easy to install  solo and only took a few hrs (and thats for a girl!) was put on my 2006 f150. Wish I would have put 35s even though it says it can fit I was skeptical and don't want to cut my bumper just yet. I wish the level kit made it a bit larger like it did with my tundra but Im pretty short (54) so its plenty Big for me. The truck looks sick and I love thats it cAme with some stickers. Added it to my front windshield:)enjoy the pics guys.

I recently bought this gallon size simply because of the price.  So many detailers cost 10 bucks or more for a 16 oz. size.  I use this as a glide for the scrubber (not so much as I used to as the Nanoskin bubble bath rocks) and a detailer spray.  It works fantastic as a detailer and it smells good!  If you wipe your car down as much as I do, that matters. It dries clear and does not streak.

Thes are great.  Good up to 85 amps. Heat sink disperse heat well, and has double sided tape on the back to stick wherever is convenient. I used these along with some relays to wire my front parking lights to act as DRL's on my 2013 dodge durango. Used the diodes so the headlight switch could still turn on the lights when the key is off, then installed switchback LED's so the DRL's are white but turns are still amber.  Used also to wire in my aux reverse lights as work lights without back feeding my truck. Great product.

One of the proven names in the automotive world, Mobil1 is known for synthetic oils.They do flow well comapre to dino oil.  Which helps with lubrication when cold. Having said that during my last differential and transfer case oil change I dumped the entire bottle into a brand new Motive Fluid Pump.  Guess what I see.I don't know what it was but I assumed it is precipitate of some sort?Didn't bother me enough to stop using the 6 quarts I ordered.Wonder if this is quality control issue.Thought I would share.

Awesome Shocks installed on my 96 XJ with a 3 inch Lift changed the ride dramatically much more responsive and adaptive both On and Off Road situations. If you Never bought a Premium Shock like Bilstein make this your first. (They blow Quadratec,Pro-Trash,Junk Country out of the water.) They don't soften when Hard braking or Clunk over Wash Boards i can not explain the Difference it made in the drivability of my XJ. Just make sure to not over-tighten the top about a 1/2 inch of stud sticking out is adequate. Also if the shock spins you can hold it still with a Hex/Torx,I just used my hand. I will note the boots come black like shown( I Bought the Yellow. Bellows)The Hardest part is the Driver side which is under the Brake booster which makes it a tight fit without a Box wrench. I used a 3/8 Drive and a wobble Extension and didn't have a problem. All-in-All i can't be happier Buy them if you need them! (See Pictures)

This is a tiny powerful blower, it will go from hair dryer to almost hurricane blast. I feel like it will be great for drying and blowing out anything in the truck. There is a plastic rattle when turning it upside down, nothing big or I'm worried about. I feel this will work great on the front bumper and side mirrors, they are constantly holding water after a wash.I like the lock button on the side of the trigger, solid clicking action. The front scroll is for working the speed of the blower.

If the front bowtie was cut correctly when manufactured i would give these 5 stars. But the right side of the front bowtie isn't isnt straight. I included pics. The rear bowtie looks sweet. I put these on my 2013 Tahoe LTZ with white diamond pearl paint. Also have black chrome rims. Love the look!! Hopefully Amazon will send me a new front bowtie that is cut straight and ill update my review to 5 stars.

After much deliberation I decided to go with the 5" iBoard steps for 15' Silverado Crew Cab. I will say this first and tell you more after. The steps are absolutely worth the money. They look great. Mine came packaged well and undamaged from UPS(shocker I know).I gave these steps 4 stars for the following reasons. The directions(although they do include images) are mostly useless and you really have to just climb under the truck to get started. You really need to measure the distance on the boards compared to your mounting locations to save you time and hassle. It would have been really nice to have a "front" or " back" on the steps if they are truly only meant to be mounted a certain way.The other reason that attributed to the 4 star rating is that 4 of the lock washer actually failed and split open during normal tightening. I wasn't over tightening or using exorbitant pressure. That resulted in taking the bolts out and I was able to bend them back into shape for the most part. I used loctite so I wasn't too worried about using a damaged lock washer. The hardware package DOES NOT include extra bolts, washers or lock nuts for the just in case scenarios.Definitely follow the directions with regard to leaving the bolts loose at first in the mounts and steps, you need a little wiggle room especially on the passenger side to get some of the bolts into the step itself. Once they are started I went ahead and tightened the mounts and had no issues with fitment of the step itself after. It took me just shy of 2 hours because I have back issues. Someone more limber could easily do it faster.I would definitely buy these again. Also note, that despite it being Prime eligible, you will likely not get these in 2 days. Mine took 4 days.

While replacing the battery on my factory original key fob, the plastic clip that holds the key head (top of fob) to the transmitter (bottom of fob) broke off. I went to my Mazda dealership and was told I needed to order an whole new key fob and have them program it along with cutting a new key. All totaled the cost would be close to $300.00.  The transmitter worked fine, as did the key...they just wouldn't stay together. For a year I used black electrical tape to hold the two components together. I found this replacement fob case w/key blank and thought it was too good to be true. After reading the reviews and taking in the tips offered by other reviewers I simply transferred the electronics of my original fob to the new one. The original has the Mazda logo on the key head. I carefully pried it off with a small jewelers screw driver. I was able to swap my original factory key with the blank of the new fob. I swapped the chip located next to the metal key from the old fob to the new one. From start to finish, 20 minutes. Tested the transmitter and the key to insure that everything worked correctly and it did. with a small dab of silicon I applied the original fob's Mazda logo in the recessed area of the new fob...perfect fit. I would recommend this product to anyone that wants factory original quality for hundreds less than the original. This replacement fob is dead on in weight, appearance, fit and quality to my original........AWESOME!!!

This filter appears to be high quality, but quality doesn't count for much when it doesn't fit. It appears to be the same size as the original but it doesn't want to go in at all and is very difficult to get in all the way. After much adjusting I was able to get it in but am not happy about the way it fits. The filter deforms when installed and lets air around it (see photo). A filter that doesn't filter doesn't do much good.I DO NOT RECOMMEND. It's been just over a month so I cannot return this.

These entry guards are very easy to install and once in place they are solid, they come with 3M adhesive. Just make sure you clean the are with alcohol. They protect your paint and look great. The gap you see in the rear door is from the factory rubber, not these.

Once again Viking cycle provides an excellent jacket at an excellent price! This has plenty of pockets to store all your valuables, a fully sleeve zip out liner, and even a concealed carry pocket on the inside. It mesh so it flows plenty. Perfect for those hot days when you want projection but don't want to feel suffocated by a thick jacket.

this is the best looking vinyl carbon fiber. I have tried 4 other styles, but the deep gloss here makes a big difference. It looks more like the real thing than any others. One thing that has not been mentioned here is that this is a 3 ply product. This means that in addition to the paper backing on the adhesive side, there is a clear film on the top of the black carbon vinyl. This protects while installing, but the gloss increases when you take it off. It's a little tricky to get started in peeling it off, but goes quickly afterward.

Love these led headlights. Gave them 4 stars only because the low beams lack in brightness, the high beams on the other hand are amazing. I drive mostly back country roads to get home after 2nd shift and the highs have saved my truck from deer on multiple occasions. I would really recommend these.

This was a perfect solution for my 2007 Tahoe that has 115,000 miles on it.  The ride is like new and the installation was straight forward and NO spring compressor needed with this complete replacement option...!  Good price for this well built product.  I now have Monroe's on the front and rear of my Tahoe and am very happy with the new ride I have on this aging truck..:)  Thank you !

Installed part in 05 Screw 5.4 on 9/29/17. Part failed yesterday on 6/26/18 and after 4,300 miles. Dealer verified part most likely not motorcraft for it to fail so soon. Replaced with one purchased from dealer. Do not recommend this part or company that sells them at this point. Good riddance.

I have no idea why this got any bad reviews. This top is an exact replacement for the original jeep "TJ" tops (wrangler 97-06). This top went on for me in about 30 mins with no help from anyone and only a cordless drill with a screwdriver bit. It fits great, does not flap, the tinted windows look awesome and the material is tough. It does take some muscle to stretch some areas but that ensures a better fit. Overall if anything happened I would buy this again in a heartbeat, awesome top and changes the whole jeeps look.

I love the concept. I wish I knew things like this existed years ago. I was excited to receive this item.I had my hopes up for this thing. It seems perfect, especially for automotive harness wires. It would allow me to hold wires together that were not on my bench. Unfortunately I was not so thrilled upon opening the package.As you can see in the attached photos, this thing is small. It will easily fit in the palm of your hand. I expected it to be a little bigger than that. Also, the magnets on both sides had a pretty decent layer of surface rust right out of the package.The alligator clips are somewhat sturdy but not robust. They are simply crimped into the aluminum. What happens if that crimp fails? The arms are connected to the base via magnets. Likely neodymium or similar magnets. I expected it them to be mechanically connected. I don't like the magnetic arms as they easily come off if you are pulling on the wire.Armed with alligator clips and neodymium magnets, the average person could build a better setup for less money.

This isn't for motorcycle helmets. The strap width is too narrow. The quality is good but the sizing is definitely bicycle helmet territory. Not sure if worth the cost of returning. Oh well.

2 Month review. Hey guys I wanted to check back in to let you know that after the rainy season here in Southern Illinois ( Which was a lot this year)  the lugs still look brand new. I had read some reviews on these lugs about them rusting so that worried me. After two months though mine are still in great shape. As I stated in the original review, I did apply all of these by hand and did not use an air impact. I was wondering if people were chipping them with the impact then they rusted? I don't know..But anyway...2 months still rust free and looking good! Will update again after some more time.Original review: I ordered these to replace the nasty lugnuts I had on these rims from when I got the Tahoe. They were free shipping, Not prime, but I still got them in 2 days. That was awesome. You can see in one of my pics the old and the new lugnuts. I put these on a 1999 Tahoe that has Moto Metal 954 Wheels. A regular 4 way would not get in the holes but the socket that comes with this set goes right in. You will need a breaker bar and a deep well socket to use this set as you can see in the pictures. I just did all 4 wheels by hand in less than 40 minutes. I wouldn't recommend using a air impact on these. You may damage the chrome. Thats your call though.  Just get your breaker bar on there and hand crank them down. My old lug nuts set down in the hole and these come out the edge of the hole...I like the look of them. Anyway I will update my review if these chip/crack, peel, rust etc. Do your homework before you order lug nuts and make sure you are getting the right ones. So tired of seeing bad reviews because people order the wrong lug nuts. I hope the pictures give you a little bit better idea of what they look like and how long they are.  Happy Shopping!!!

I have been detailing cars for over 35 years, and have used just about ever product you can find on a store shelf. I read some reviews for this last week and decided to give it a try on my Black Cadillac. I did the entire car in less then an hour and the shine was excellent.The thing that really got my attention however was the next day it rained and my car was out in it all day at the airport. I came home and put it in the garage, the next morning it looked like someone cleaned the car, there was not a spot on it, it was actually so clean I asked my wife is she wiped it down, she laughed and asked me if I did the same to her car which is lighter in color, but I had also don't with the black light. All I can say is I am very impressed, and will continue to use this product on my cars.

My existing Kuryakyn throttle grip was 13 years old on the custom chopper I have.  The inside part of the old grip that held the throttle cable circle pin had broken.  I replaced with a new one and it works magnificently.  See attached pictures for the 13 year old throttle grip and the new one after following the instructions that come with the new pair of grips.The delivery on this was the fastest I've ever seen from Amazon.  I ordered at about 6pm yesterday and the new grips arrived this morning at 8:30am.Pros of the Kuryakyn 6212 Premium ISO Grips:1. Looks good2. Comfort is great3. Installation is easy when following the instructions4. Price is goodCons:Nothing that I can think of

Flimsy filter does not hold its own shape- allows air bypass on sides. Without a lip to hold it in place on my particular filter/truck combo, the sides were concave enough to see past a gap.

Looks same as Behr/Mann and installs in about ten minutes if you have the right tools. The tools needed are a Torx-25 and a flat head screwdriver to pry open a pair of factory installed metal clamps (you probably don't have to reinstall this after, your choice). This air filter is much more significant in air coverage than lets say some air filters for many American or Japanese cars, so it is reasonable these cost more. The carbon impregnation helps in reducing odor. Made in Czech Republic.

I purchased this wiring adapter for my new 2012 Nissan Murano. The product works, but the instructions tells you to do several things including running a power wire from the module up to the battery. I removed all the interior trim on the drivers side of the vehicle and ran the included wire up to the fuse panel (the instructions tell you to run under the vehicle... I DO NOT LIKE THIS IDEA. As I was inspecting my vehicle for a proper place to connect the wire that would look good and make a good connection I found an empty fuse (under the hood) labeled TRAILER. I remembered seeing a single white wire back by the spare tire. I put a fuse in the trailer place and found out that the white wire / connector at the spare tire was actually the power wire for the factory tow harness... USE THAT!!!! Do not run the wire all the way up to the front of the vehicle.Also, the manufacturer says to keep the wire inside the spare tire area and run it out the door when you need it... that is fine, but there is a rubber grommet inside the spare tire area (at the right center by the bumper) where you can run the 4 wires through (there are already wires going out this grommet. Simply pop it out, put your wires through and seal it up good and place it back in the hole.  If you follow these steps you will have a quick, safe and clean install.Additionally, I went to a local trailer parts warehouse and picked up a 4 wire connector mounting bracket. I now have my connector firmly mounted outside the vehicle where it should be.  (NOTE: amazon prime as a similar product... if you are prime order that at the same time... they will not ship it alone, costs too much ... it is a prime add on item).If it were not for the instructions and many steps outlined incorrectly I would have given this product 5 stars. It has only been installed for about an hour and tested fine but have not used for any amount of time to make sure it lasts (other reviews say it is great... that I why I bought it).

Just as others have discovered this product is actually pretty great. It is not nearly as thin as some have claimed and the installation is straight forward. It does come with several different mounting bracket choices with different sized bolts and hardware but you WILL have to drill more holes depending on your make and model of bike and your luggage rack. I felt that the back cushion install could be a bit better but it was still easy enough. When it was all said and done it looks amazing on my 2006 Honda Shadow Aero. The Vivid Black color as they described it matches the gloss black of my shadow perfectly. I chose to not install the top rack for now but I may change my mind on that later.Note: The reflective red tape is something that I added, it is not included.All-in-all this trunk is WELL WORTH the price and fairly high quality. It beats a $750 trunk any day of the week.

Easy to install. Fitment is not 100%, but they look good and they work. I added a little blue lock tight to the screws to help keep them in place. Also the screws, are not as bad as some people. I had no problem with installing them. No broken screws and they aligned ok. One tip, align them with the raduis near the thumb button. It will fit, look, and feel better. Tools used: a clamp, loc tight, 1/16 bit, 1/8 bit, and a driver. I painted them with cheap black walmart touch up paint. Which dries pretty quickly.

This topper fits pretty good even though the bed is tapered.  It is water tight except at the tailgate, a little water does leak in around there.  I added a couple of C clamps to hold it on the bed a little more securely as the supplied clamps are not the most secure in the world.  If you are thinking this is easily folded down and put back up, it isn't.  It took 2 of us 3 hours and several beers to get all the panels installed and in the right place.  It is light enough that you could remove it, as a whole, by yourself.It is a very nice looking addition to my Dodge.  I've had it on there for several years and don't regret buying it.

High quality, Impressed for the most part. My only complaint with this is the lack of top external shielding. If something crazy were to happen due to stress of the wire or this terminal's oblong design to make it short with the hood, and thus the chassis, I will be screwed [of course, it's probably just paranoia talking]. On the bright side, the hex bolts get extremely tight with no problems so far in the integrity of the threads (thank you nickel plating), which is good considering that my OEM 1 gauge rail wouldn't mind another centimeter or two of slack.

Makes the plastic interior,tires and trim pieces shine really good and it smells great!Only down side is that it doesn't dry on contact when using it on tires. Side of vehicle has it all over the side.Removing it is not as tough as other tires sprays but does collect dust and creates that dark Brown ring on the edges

I just got this set, looks like they'll work. I tested it on a harness I had laying around, and it worked. It has a good variety of forked, blade, and round type.Looking at it, the case is cheezy but should last a little while at least. The biggest issue is the quality. They look like made in china low quality kind of stuff you find at HF. The one that it says is for slitting harnesses without damaging wires, had a big nick in the blade. I used my thin rod knife sharpener to get it smoothed, which was effortless. That tells me the quality of steel used is pretty low. Based on visual quality, my opinion is this set should cost 30bucks or so. If I put my hands on it first, I would have passed. Time will tell...

The reason behind my review, is not just for build quality. The quality is good, I enjoy the overall weight of the shifter. I ordered a black wrap and red base, that originally came with silver captions in the photos, but came with gold. Gold is fine, just doesn't match much.The main reason, is the absolute lack of instructions. It became an insanely aggrivating topic. So save the troubles, I'll provide the instructions for a 2010 honda civic si.Take wrench, twist bolt counter clockwise to loosen, and then remove original shift knob. Attatch the m10x1.50 adapter to the sword base, just twist it all the way in. Throw the largest washer/nut on the bottom of the base, then the one that threads into your m10x1.50. Then after that twist the sword onto the base, and adjust so the m10x1.5 nut smashes into the bottom of the sword base. Make sure it is alligned to your proper adjustments/personal matters. I hope this helps. Please, for future matters provide instructions. I minorly damaged my threads and screamed my head off in aggrivation for an hour. Learn from me and I wish you well.Product is badass and helps me bang into third gear with no problem, which is going to help make me go zoom zoom faster.

Absolutely AMAZING!!!  Just installed this on my 2015, 2 door Jeep Wrangler Sahara, Altitude Edition.  Beyond happy and pleased!  Build quality is fantastic and the sound is PERFECT!  No drone at all at cruising speeds and the sound while accelerating is exactly what this Jeep needed.  Jeep should offer this as a dealer installed option!  At under $500, this is an absolute no-brainer!  I paid $50 to have it installed at my local Midas (30 min) and it was quick and easy!  Pipes are an exact fit. No cutting or welding; all clamps. The chrome tips sit perfectly level and the "db" etching looks great!  With only 15 miles on the exhaust, I already love the sound.  Was told to give it 200-300 miles to break in and the sound will be even better!  Have not noticed any performance change.  Would absolutely recommend this to anyone with a Jeep!

I ordered the silver finish and it is very close to that mirror look you see on most visors. There is a bit of transparency if the sun is extremely bright and even then you could hardly see inside the helmet from the outside. You CAN ride at night with this faceshield! I know a lot of people said you can't or it's frowned upon but I think you can see very clearly with it down at night with no troubles. As for cleaning I would stick to SOAP and WATER ONLY. I accidentally got windex on the visor when I was cleaning my helmet but I immediately wiped it off and everything still looks great. Surprising because these tinted face shields have a film on them that are supposed to melt with cleaning chemicals. Just to be safe clean with soap and water I wouldn't test it to far.Before you choose, I would definitely do a photoshop comparison of which color you are looking for. I was deciding between the gold and silver and I couldn't find anywhere what my helmet would look like with those face shields nobody had posted anything even close in other reviews and such. Glad I did the comparison.Overall, wayyy better than the clear one my Exo T-510 came with. Buy!

We own a Chevy Volt electric car.  Our HOV lane stickers were starting to peel off. This was the perfect solution to keep them on. Also, as added safety to keep them from getting stolen. HOV stickers are very expensive and a real pain to get replaced.My advice is as soon as you get the HOV stickers, put this protective coating over them. Also, put the stickers on the car paint, not on the plastic. This 3M product holds well on plastic, but the HOV stickers will peel off after a few years.There is enough on this roll to do all 4 stickers, plus and extra if you mess up for some reason.I used the extra to cover a delicate white decal on the back of my car, and it worked great for that too.

I was trying to decide between these and the Husky wheel well liners; I have Husky X-Act Contour floor mats that I really like. My hold up was the Husky liners cost almost 2x the price as these and while they appear to have more coverage by a few inches, I wasn't sure it was worth the added cost.I gave these a shot and I'm pleased with them. The plastic is thick and has mostly clean cuts throughout; some spots where I cut away some left over plastic bits, but nothing substantial.I installed them shortly after they arrived; it was warm so they were more pliable after sitting on the delivery truck and sitting in the sun. All I used was a socket set (very basic, maybe has 20 pieces;) believe it was the 10mm and my hands. If I had to do it again I'd put on my mechanic gloves, the plastic needs to be pushed up under the lip and takes some force.Install took me around 45 minutes. 15 on the drivers side and then 30 on the passenger side. I didn't do any prep work, the wheel wells were pretty clean already and what wasn't clean came loose and fell out as I worked the liner into place. For some reason the plastic took some convincing to push up under the lip and then I struggled to get the 3 holes to line back up to reinsert the bolt. You don't need any new bolts or additional parts, you reuse the 2 bolts you remove.I don't do any off road driving, I got these 1. To hide a wire loom I have running along the frame for my backup camera and 2. Cleaner look and if it helps keep things cleaner that's a bonus. The only reason I could see to buying the Husky's now is simply for a bit more coverage so if you do drive off road often then the added expense might be worth a little less cleaning, for me it just meant I got all new door speakers and wheel liners for the same cost and Husky wheel liners.

I bought some 6000k HIDs for my motorcycle to get away from the whole yellow halogen color. Once I installed those I needed to replace the running lights on the side as well. After doing some research I found these on Amazon and went with them, Sylvania being a very reputable brand and all. My only concern was that the color tone wouldn't match up with my headlights but boy was I wrong! I put these suckers in and when I flipped on the HIDs they matched perfect, that super white color with just a slight slight tint of blue. So thank you Sylvania for holding true to the color tone!You can see from the first picture how the Sylvania bulb compares to my stock halogen bulb, and in the second picture how the bulbs look perfect with my HIDs. I bought these LEDs to give the bike a much more aggressive modern, and crisper look, and to make it more noticeable to other drivers for both day and night. They did exactly what I bought them to do. 5 stars!

Well it's a bit early to review but I really needed to change mine and for the price I believe it was worth the effort. It is a bit tricky to remove and put on as you need an Allen Wrench and a 14 mm wrench to set it up otherwise they spin indefinitely. I use Beck Arnley for my ball joint, wheel hub and now the stabilizer end link on my 2001 Honda Civic LX Coupe and so far no problems. We'll see how they will hold and will update the review if I need to.

The bumper cover fit my 2015 Subaru Impreza 2.0i Premium really well. It's super easy to put on...took just a couple of minutes. Aesthetically, the bumper looks better with the cover on...it looks less plain. I'm really happy with it so far.Before I purchased this, I read another review saying that the texture wasn't rubbery...and that is correct. It isn't rubbery. This is made from hard plastic- and it feels like it. But I'll take it over Subaru's cheap-feeling clear bumper protector. I don't know why Subaru doesn't provide a more durable cover for the Impreza.This bumper cover will do the job just fine.

This light is awesome! I bought one for my Polaris RZR and use it as a dome light. It's super bright and it's one less thing I had to wire on the side by side. I did buy 15lbs Velcro just to make sure it doesn't fall off and it has last 500 plus miles of bumps and jump on the same battery. I just got this one for our X3 and expect it to perform just as well!

Well. I was a true critic at first. But was sold when I plugged a nice size hole in my bike tire with this kit. Saved me from buying a new tire this season.I did add a little rubber cement on the application area before I pushed in two plugs. The 1st one was a challenge getting in but the second one slide in nice and easy. After letting it set up for 3 minutes I could see the plugs starting to stick together really well. I trimmed the end of the plug put a bit more rubber cement on it and pushed the excess flat against the tire.3 Weeks and 300 miles later the tire hasn't leaked one pound of air.Good product. I left it in my bike saddle bag for the next time we have a flat we can repair it and keep moving.

Good quality light bar. I got the 20" light bar and it is very bright. I took the precaution of sealing around the lens and frame with silicone. This has been one of the rainiest Washington fall and winters and the light bar has held up with no moisture getting in. It was easy to install hardware wise. I didn't use the harness so I can't comment on the quality of the relay or switch.

Look great on the 300. Only thing wrong and may have been due to install, but when I get on the gas, there is a whistle created from the exhaust after I had them installed. I'm thinking it's due to the center piece of metal and the exhaust splitting that.

Works very good. Tighten up the rear end. Only thing I don't like is it  squeaks with the bushing you get with it so I put a little grease on it witch stopped the squeak but it made the bar  slide back and forth when turning (you could feel it move when on a turn) so I put some hose clamps on each side to stop it from sliding. But other then that its awesome ran it stock and now on 4 inches of lift and works perfectly. A must buy for stock and lifted Jeeps. Helped turns at higher speeds and improved braking. For off-roading I recommend getting some quick disconnects. Very rough offroad but my Jeep is a street queen so Im not worried about the offroad handling. Well worth the money best bang for your buck.

I installed these to lower my sons bike. Since I'm used to installing shocks and working on motorcycles, it was fairly easy. So the lack of instructions did not bother me at all. What does bother me is that these shocks are frozen in place. I'm sure they will break free on the first good chug hole but this bike is being dropped in the front to match the rear by cutting the neck and raking it out, so if they happen to break loose and the bike drops even lower I'll be perturbed about the whole deal.

I bought this product in hopes that it would help the tire blooming (browning) that I'm experiencing. I read that a good tire cleaner/degreaser would help and based on reviews I gave this product a try. Needless to say this might have permanently ruined my $340 a piece tires. I applied it as per the directions and it literally took the black off my tires and turned them tan. It took an entire bottle of Aero Cosmetics Tire Dressing to turn them back black and that was just temporary. It has since rained and all the black has worn off. I wish I could give this product zero stars.

ORDERED = 07/27/2016 || SELLER = Amazon.com LLC || PAID = $135.12(Beware of Seller changes! That's when you may get burned!):: PROS ::1.)  The official product, well-made, good quality - feels legit!2.)  ALL needed parts included, installs in minutes.3.)  Adjustment handle tension feels GREAT on these new lights!:: CONS ::1.)  NO LED - Why do we not have LED spot options as a BASE level unit!?!?2.)  The holes in the frame are always a pain to close off 100% (Winter months can let in elements)3.)  There's nothing SPECIAL about the wiring and components, despite the price! (Why NO Stainless Fasteners?)4.)  For a FULL PRICED Spot it would be impressive to see better quality wire & better metal parts.** Nothing seems impressive about the electrical design & construction.  Alligator clamps, cheap gauge wire & non-stainless steel fasteners?

Came in fast and I know a lot of complaints I read is that its plastic but so far quality is great and its way lighter than any other filter set up I have encountered.  Mine doesn't sit on the engine either so I can't say I am worried about it melting or anything but after running it for a week or so it has noticeable power increase.

The Opt7 lighting kit was really easy to install and set up. It comes with a few different fuse taps but unfortunately the newer Mustangs take an odd style fuse and I had to tap into my fuse box for power. You can also run this off your cigarette lighter but I wanted a cleaner look.I only needed two of the strips for the front and I may eventually run two more lights under my seats or try to come up with another creative way to light the car.This is an awesome set and I am looking forward to running other Opt7 lighting in my car in the future.

A carpet extractor is a must have for auto detailing. And.. if you're not sure what exactly you want/ need out of a carpet extractor, I'd 100% suggest that you go with the mytee lite! This machine covers it all to get you started. It has great heat, psi, vacuum, etc.. and it's easy to use. As well as being a heavy-duty field tested machine. Now.. some extractors may do certain  things better, but.. this mytee definitely does all the things that you need and it does them well. Now.. if you have a shop or a large mobile business going already.. I would assume that you  know this is a entry level unit. This machine is definitely for someone in the driveway looking to expand their options, performance, and results. Or... for the bigger business to throw in the trailers and go. Summary: get it! Use it! And know that you have a machine that can be used in some way At any level of car detailing.

The final product looks great, posted a customer image to Amazon to show. Relatively easy install, very tight space to work in and had to fiddle a bit to get into the right angles for the nuts inside. Really pulls the top down nice and tight so I expect it to fix the "hood flutter" at high speeds or in strong winds. The keys leave a little to be desired and I have to fiddle with those quite a bit to get them in and out in both locked and unlocked positions. Might fix itself over time but for now that's mainly why I only went 4 stars, otherwise it's a solid product it seems and a great upgrade over stock rubber clamps.

So far seems great. Installed on a 2015 Can-Am Commander UTV. Needed to buy a mounting plate, but that was inexpensive (about $50) so the combination of this winch and the mounting plate was still cheaper than the Can-Am version (which is the exact same winch, by the way, just different mount.)  Installation takes a little time because there isn't a lot of room to work with on a Can-Am. This will sit directly in front of the radiator, so be careful that you don't bump the winch into it, as it could be easily damaged.  Also, be very aware of your excess wiring and make sure to zip tie or cut down the wire. Again, not much room and any excess wire around the winch could easily be caught up in moving parts (very close to the fan, for example) or suspension. Not difficult, just be aware as you work through it.  On the base Can-Am Commander, you'll need to modify the front fascia quite a bit after taking out t he plastic filler piece that covers where the winch fairlead would go.  I used a dremmel and a sanding bit and it came out perfect. The switch that comes with it is good, but doesn't match all the Can-Am switches. You can order the actual winch switch from the BRP/Can-Am website for about $16 bucks. I recommend this because the winch switches that are out there seem cheap...I know because I just bought one and it broke during install.  Worth it to get the real switch if you want to mount it with the other switches, and the price is only about $4 more than the cheap ones. The Commander has a spot for the winch remote already set up in the glove box. Has the two bolt holes already cut, you just need to cut out the circle where the remote plug is installed. I did notice that on my base model Commander, all of the winch wiring is already through the firewall from the winch mounting area (including for solenoid) to the dash, but they seemed to have plugged all the connectors with some kind of filler so that you cannot easily use them. After a while thinking about how I could use them to avoid running wire, I just gave up and ran my own wire. Saved me time in the long run, but annoyed me that all the wiring I needed was right in front of me but too difficult to strip off connectors and install new ones because of the lack of room. I chose to put the remote plug on the driver's side on the dash area to the left of the steering column in case I was alone and needed to use the winch but be able to easily get to the steering wheel. I also chose to put in a switch for the dashboard....my replacement switch is on its way from Can-Am now, so I will replace this cheap one with a factory switch as soon as it comes in.  Took several hours from start to finish, but I am somewhat OCD with installs LOL!  Good luck!

Very nice looking lights. My HIDs were a bit brighter although didn't work too well because the bulbs kept blowing out... Wish they didn't make my "light out" indicator lights turn on.

My OEM front marker lamp, which is in the headlight housing, uses 5 watts.  This lamp uses 2 watts, and is brighter. Keep in mind that this is a marker lamp, or parking lamp.  It is not meant to throw light down the road or enable night driving.  At best, it aides in illuminating the space ahead for parking, and it allows other people on the road to see you.  The obvious question has always been, "who turns on just the marker lamps?"  After all, unless you were drunk, why would you drive around with the parking lamps on and headlight off?  Does this provide additional lighting?  Yes.  But not enough light for what you want, if your goal is to add illumination to your factor of visibility.  This little light is not going to make the road any brighter, if you can't see and the headlights are already on.  Perhaps you shouldn't be driving if conditions are such that heavy fog, snow, sleet, & rain are impairing your visibility.  It does help me find my car in a dark parking lot.  So if you're hoping to find something that will light up the night, this is not it.  On the make & model I applied the item to, there was sufficient space for fitment.UPDATE 2 DAYS LATER:Unit heated up, melted it's own glue, and fell apart within the headlamp housing.

Just got this today and it seems like a good little product. Nice packaging and carry case, strong light, great 3 headed charging accessory the charges mini usb, regular usb and most importantly, and surprisingly, one head is a lightning charger for newer iPhones!!! What a bonus.  Comes with a car adapter to charge the charger itself,but you will need to use any usb mini cord to charge from home, and it is not included. I hope I don't have to ever use the jump feature but I am curious to see how well it works.

I've been buying off-road/all-terain tires for 27 years and have owned BF Goodrich All Terrain TAs, Pirelli Scorpions, Yokohama Geolandar A/T (a close 2nd in performance, not even close in tire life), Dunlop Radial Rovers, Michelins, and several others.  These are light-years better in almost every regard.  They handle incredibly off-road, in heavy snow (I live in CO), and on the highway.  Usually you pay a price for this in terms of tire wear.  I used to get about 20-25k miles out of a set.  I am over 45k miles on these and I have at least another 10k miles of use left on these!!  I swear on my life.  I frankly would not believe this myself if I wasn't a witness.  I bought these at Discount tire, so no you won't see a verified purchase, but I have nothing to gain by posting this review.  I am an engineer with heavy mechanical background if that adds any weight to my review, and I am extremely picky.These are incredible tires, period, end of sentence.  Pictures of all 4 are attached with just over 45k miles on them.  They still have .23" or 7.5/32" of tread depth.  Incidentally I have never owned Hankooks before and only bought them instead of the Yokohamas due to increase in the Yokohamas price and a recommendation by the Discount tire guy.  Thet are also, i found out later, Consumer Reports top rated all-terrain tire.  What a find....

I am extremely happy with this key. The quality of it is far better than expected and I couldn't be happier with my decision to purchase it. I truly don't understand how it could get anything less than 5 stars, unless the buyer didn't read the description. I received it only a couple days after ordering it, and immediately brought it to Lowes to be cut. When the guy cutting the key asked me how much I paid for it and I told him, his response was "wow, you got that for a steal". He then cut the key (with no issues whatsoever) and I walked outside to try it. As expected, it worked perfectly and I now have a spare key for my 98 Toyota 4runner. I will be purchasing at least 1-2 more, as you cannot have too many spares.

We bought a 12 year old pre-owned travel trailer from an older couple.  They said they always hooked up to a sewer and left the valve open.  Bad idea.  Everything in the grey and black tanks was also pre-owned.  Not good.  Neither tank gauges read correctly.  Shining a light down in the commode revealed a sight that I cannot describe (and shouldn't).  12 years of buildup and improper use.  I was almost certain I would have to replace the black tank.  I added a quart of RV Digest-It to the black tank, a few gallons of warm water, then topped off the tank that night (ran toilet until it was almost to the top), and let it sit for 48 hours (directions said 24-36).  I did this TWICE because, like I said... it was bad.  The first treatment did some real good but my gauge was still reading 2/3 full.  Determined, I did the second treatment as described above and drained out about 11 of the 12 years of (clears throat).  Went inside and held down the switch to reveal a completely empty tank.  All I could say was "oh crap!".  From here, it's 2 ounces added after each tank dump in both tanks.  Never, ever leave your waste valves open.  Let those tanks fill up and use this product to keep things clean, odor-free, and flowing as designed.  I love it when a product works as advertised.

(Installed in 2017 Jeep Wrangler JKU) Center piece will leave deep cuts in your factory surround for tray (see photo). Not excited about that in my brand new 2017 Jeep with 12 miles on it! Mount is very flimsy due to poor design and what appears to be ABS plastic, which gets very soft while baking in the hot sun on your dash. Even not factoring that in, it is still very flimsy. Bracket should be constructed from FRP plastic at a minimum or ideally, aluminum. Due to said flimsy bracket, phone shakes and bounces around constantly while driving (this is a Jeep, BTW! not exactly a smooth ride). As a result, phone pops out of holder on nearly every trip while driving down the road. Not only useless and very inconvenient, but ($750) phone can get damaged while making its way to floorboard hitting everything from steering wheel to wiper arm to gear shifter on the way down before finally making its way directly under your feet. This can be hazardous while driving as it invokes a near involuntary reaction to try to catch it as it is bouncing off of stuff then you're trying to reach down a retrieve it from the floorboard. Product concept is great, engineering is *very* lacking. Definitely do not recommend nor would I buy again.

These are not angled properly to be able to attach the light bar. When mounted, the brackets angle inward and make it impossible to mount the light bar because the bolts go through the bracket at an angle and the light bar mounts horizontal, which means the bolts need to in a horizontal position, not at an angle. See picture as reference. The bracket needs to be vertical at the light bar mounting spots.

Love this tool box. Took me about a hour to install. I have a 2014 Ram 3500 long bed dually. The directions said I didn't have to cut out a hold down hook but that was not this case. There's no way to install this with out removing the hold down hook. I also machined some spacers so the box would sit plumb, the top has a tendency to lean in toward the bed wall because of the surface its mounted to. Not a hard thing to do, you could use a stack of washers and that would work fine. I've included some pictures. I would buy this again in a heart beat. Hope this helps Ram owners.

So far, so good! I've only used two strips in my trunk and all LEDs are lit. The adhesive on the back is sticking nicely to the metal frame in the trunk. We'll see how well it holds up in the heat of the summer.The white strand does look a little bit blue, but not quite as blue as the pictures make it out to look. If I had to compare it to my LED headlights that are 6000K, I would probably say these are around 7000K - 7500K.

Race Ramps RR-56-2 56" review.  Great ramps for lo profile cars.  I have 2 generations of Z's and have tried to use various ramps and wood constructions for oil changes and maintenance with little success.  These ramps aren't cheap, but they support my vehicles safely and give quite a bit of room under the car.  They don't slide and the front lip of my Z's doesn't try to push them out of the way.  I really like the 2 piece construction so I can get under the side of the car easier and store them easier.  I should have bought these a long time ago.  I also bought the Race Ramp wheel chocks to go with these.  If you are concerned as to whether your car work with these ramps then just go to the Race Ramp web site for measurements.

These spacers are excellent quality, come with everything but red threadlocker, and are a perfect fit for a 2016 Ram 1500, no trimming of the original studs needed. Hub centric is the way to go and this is the company you should buy from. I included some pics of the spacers and what my tires on stock 20s looked like after. 1.5 is perfect for stock fender flares or trim.

So I just got these tires put on last week and then this weekend went on a camping trip. We went fairly high up in the Colorado mountains towards Steamboat and we were hit with intense rain storms and hail. However these tires never had any issues toughing through the twisty roads, hills, dirt roads, Hail and wet roads. The picture above shows just how much hail was on the road and how much these tires trucked through.I did slightly hydro plane on the highway going 65-70mph. However after feeling that I slowed down and didn't have any issues even while seeing 2 cars spin out and off the road.I am curious to see how they hold up in the winter time, however so far I am very pleased.. especially for the price for the tires! I will update with how long they last miles wise and in winter use!

These lights are good, but are definitely floods and not spots. I debated for a while about which to get, and ultimately went with these and mounted them on the A pillars on my truck as ditch lights. My high beams don't have much spread to the left and right and for the most part throw the light pretty far center so I decided auxiliary lights would be most helpful if they had more spread than throw. So far that seems to be holding true but I think these would be best used in combination with other spot lights or a spot light bar.Construction:They feel solid and none of the alan head screws were loose upon arrival. The metal doesn't feel cheap and the mounting hardware is all pretty solid. They have been on the truck for over a month in all kinds of weather with no rust issues so far. I did seal them up with silicone around the lenses before mounting so I can't speak for the waterproofness, though I have had absolutely no fogging or visible water inside after sealing.Beam:The beam characteristics definitely depend on where you mount these, but when mounted on the A pillars as ditch lights they flood light nearly 180 degrees. Plenty of light onto the sides of the road/trail and upwards into the trees. Definitely a big help on country roads, ranch roads and trails. There are tons of deer and game animals in my area and these definitely help to see what's on your left and right when driving.Wiring:I used a Nilight 2-lead wiring harness with a rocker switch and pre-wired relay to wire these up. The harness is good quality and is 10395838204x easier than making your own. However, the positive and negative leads turned out to be too short to reach the leads coming off the lights so I had to make extensions for one side, and an extension for the positive (red) wire running to the rocker switch inside the truck. This won't be a problem if you're mounting the lights closer together or on a smaller vehicle, but have some extra wire and connectors on hand in case you run into this problem mounting them on a larger vehicle. Make sure you tape up all connections with electrical tape or heat shrink to ensure no moisture gets inside. This problem has nothing to do with the quality of these lights, this is simply an FYI and may just make your install easier.Overall these lights are indispensable and will last a lifetime. Even with the pre-made wiring harness you're still in it for less than $30 so why not pick some up. I will definitely be buying more Nilight products in the future and have no doubt that these will hold up for years

The lenses were easy to install.  As you can see, the picture that's looking down at the headlights with the red lines reveals that one side sits further forward than the other due to one side being the high beam and the other is the low beam.  Focusing the beams with this type of system is not a problem.  I deducted one star due missing screws for one of the lenses.

Have this battery over 14 months for my 2013 Fiat Abarth. 1.4L Turbo. It just pass the second NYS inspection. The OEM battery is over 39lb + over 6lb on the OEM battery tray. and this ETX20L is only 15.2lb on the scale and I use a custom alum tray weighted only 2.75 lb. I have it install over a year now. The battery perform very well. I live in NY, Works very well on a 16 degree ice cold day at the PA ski resort to 105 degree hot summer beach days. I had about 7k miles on it. My car fire up all the time without any problem after it seats in the garage over 7 days without battery tender. But most of the time I will connected to battery tender if I know I will not use the car for longer than a week.I set my AC at 70 degree automatic and auto headlight, so AC will be use through the summer and heat on cold day automatically. I never had any problem cold start the car in the cold day out in open area, I even use my car many time up in PA ski resort. at night the temperature is no more than 16 degree at the parking lot. I fire up without any trouble.I do afraid I may have a startup problem one day, so I had a Lithium battery jump starter under the seat for emergency if it happen. the Lithium battery jumper is only weight 2.2 lb. Many people carry this anyway even with a OEM battery. so is a win win!My total setup weight is about 20.15lb with everything included custom tray and the jumper vs 45lb OEM

Awesome muffler. Didn't get it threw Amazon but I'm happy with the buy still. Had it dumped right after the muffler. It's pretty loud in the cab of my 03 Tahoe now. But not too loud. I like it. Sounds very healthy now.

I really like them, they took some time to put on, and if the control box gets wet it will stop working for a while (until it dries out), but other than that, they mike the bike look awesome.

Seems to be pretty accurate. Installation is vey easy. You do have to purchase 18-20 gauge wire separately. I used 18 gauge. I just ran 1 wire through the firewall for the sending unit. Both grounds I ran inside the cab. The power wire I ran to the accessory fuse and for the lighting I ran the wire to lights fuse. The only problem I had was that the instructions said not to use sealant on the sending unit and adapter as to get a good ground? I thought this was kind of stupid but I stuck to the instructions. My mistake! Right away it leaked. I had to pull it out and use sealant. I have it in a 87 Iroc and the sending unit is in kind of a tough place so My advice use sealant! Other than that it works great at a good price. Of course I have only had it in now for 2 days.

Good idea to replace plastic elbows with these aluminum ones, but other reviews mention poor-quality O-rings that melt with heat.  I opted to replace them with genuine GM O-rings before even installing these elbows, just to be safe and hopefully save me from having trouble later.  However, there was some confusion about what P/N O-rings to order - some GM parts lists for my 2001 F-Body have the large and small O-rings P/N's reversed. You need quantity (1) of the larger O-ring GM P/N 24502846 and quantity (3) of the smaller O-rings GM P/N 25537068 (AC Delco P/N 15-34066).  I wound up having to order multiple times to get the right O-rings, so to hopefully save others from getting the wrong ones, I have attached photos showing the correct O-rings and corresponding P/N's.  I also replaced the 2 O-rings P/N 10263197 on the heater hose ends that plug into the idler, asm just to be safe since this car is 15 years old (3rd photo).Also, another buyer mentioned to be careful not to damage the thin teflon coating on the O-rings, so I wet both the elbows and O-rings before installing them, then was very careful doing it.Hope this is helpful to someone else buying this item......

If you are replacing your gaskets because of an exhaust leak might as well just go ahead and buy these, the price is cheap and very high quality. These will fit all 2004-2010 F150's with the 5.4. It will also fit 2005-2010 Mustang GT. Fit perfect on my 2010 F150 4.6 3 valve

There's two lengths that I've seen with these honda bumper clips. it is really hard finding out which ones are the longer ones. these GOACC clips will work if you need the longer ones. the shorter ones will work but if you can find the longer ones that's what you want or you can settle for these. they are 0.8" and 1.2" respectively for the shorter and longer versions. if you need the longer ones its honda oem part#  91503-SZ5-003. I've bought 3 clips on ebay thinking they were the longer ones because it says 30mm, I have no idea why ebay sellers advertise 30mm since the longest part (the pin in the center) measures only 0.8". I did find some items on ebay and the part number I gave is what you want if you need the longer clips, they are more beefy than these GOACC. the picture shows the OEM longer 1.2" clip in the middle, the GOACC clip is on the right and the shorter ones that every one else sells and falsely say they are 300mm are on the left

This winch cover came as advertised. The cover that came with my Viper front bumper winch faded the first couple of months and got a small hole in it even though it never saw weather and has been garaged. 5 stars for the quality and price. I'll rewrite this in a couple of months after it's seen some sun.

I should have known better than to be the first to order this. I only needed this to smooth out some issues in a pond boat. Do not think this would be fine for a vehicle that you'd ever want to look at. The stuff I needed to fix will be out of sight, below the waterline, I should have just stuck to using a huge hammer as an anvil, and a smaller one to smooth it.The package claims the items were drop forged. I'd say it's much more probable they were cast, poorly, in a backyard sandbox.I haven't seen machining this bad since Pakistan was selling us "tools" back in the 80's. Seriously, I wouldn't have paid ten bucks for it at a flea market, maybe 8, but not ten.I set my expectations low, and this product failed to meet them.

Fit my 2004 Ford F250 SuperDuty perfect. Grey color match was good, it's a glossy plastic so it'll never be perfect.My AutoMeter pods fit in it well, depth was decent on all 3. Many guages have threaded rod behind them you need to trim if you want to mound them in a pod like this.Only gripe is the screw caps are not the same grey at all, they're more of a white color or extremely light grey. However, with the full A-pillar piece you can hide the screw placement pretty well so it's not a big deal.

The picture is a generic pic, the true pic is the one i uploaded and its defiantly well worth the money.Installation is ok but you will need to drill 4 holes on the inside of the bumper mounts and you will need to remove the factory tow hooks to install the hitch but put the hooks back on before you start to bolt everything up. Over all install time took me about 2 hrs by my self with an air compressor and impact gun.

Looks good to me on my 85 Chevy C10.  Comes with 3 new screws for hardware (to secure the top of grille in place.)  You'll need to use 2 original bolts (mine were size 9/32) to fasten the bottom.  When mounting make life easier and read the directions to take off the bezels around the headlights.

I bought 4 of these extended rubber exhaust hangers for my magnaflow exhaust.I changed the rear sway bar on my car, only to find the thicker diameter sway bar did not clear my exhaust. There were only a few centimeters needed to make a clearance, so I opted to hang the exhaust slightly lower.These hangers do exactly what they are meant to do. Solid build quality. They are of OEM stiffness, but actually seem even stiffer. I am not the least bit worried about having these rip. Very pleased with the product.

Hydraulics failed on this jack after barely any use. I think I used it maybe 4 times over the course of less than two years. I actually have two of these exact same jacks, but now plan on buying something else. The one pictured on my review here was purchased off amazon. I used it only when two jacks were required at the same time, so it saw very little service. Nevertheless, it still failed recently and started leaking all over the garage floor. I'm not sure if it's even worth attempting to repair it.I would advise against buying this brand of floor jack if longevity and/or safety are a concern.

Quality Honda, made in Japan part for good price. Make sure to check your tracks (where roller glides) when you remove old roller. Most common problem that plastic rolls fall off and if you use like that for long time your doors, it could make a damage to tracks. Then, even if you replace with new Honda Slide Door Roller it may not last... because tracks act like a rasp and damage rollers. Use sand paper to make smooth surface on tracks. Over all, in my opinion, for such a small price difference it is not worth go with a cheap part option. Good luck in your mechanical projects!

Worked well in repairing some hull gel-coat dock-scrapes. Mixing the two-part system required some care: used to identical sticks to insure the 5:1 volume:volume ratio (I used smooth disposable plastic silverware handles). Instructions claim there is only a 10% leeway in the proportions and all six batches so far worked fine, curing and allowing wet sanding after several hours. It is white and may contrast a bit with a 44 year old hull, but not enough to try to mix in a colorant in my case. At 85-90 degrees F., it handled more like cheap toothpaste than 'putty,' but with a firm plastic scraper, I was able to fill most scratches in one application, and all in two with sanding between applications.The instructions start with "mix all of part A (can) with all of part B (jar)" - if you need that much at once you will need an application crew and should likely consider a bulk purchase. Photos are of pre and post port-side two-application hull repairs.

Lets be clear, it does the job when working. Bought one for left and for right. The passenger side rear piston seal started leaking and does not retract correctly causing premature pad wear as you can see by photo. It symptom is hanging felt when starting cold (Yes I checked the E-brakes and adjusted to make sure they were not the issue). It started rusting already. Would have thought buying it painted it would not have done this. To make sure it was a seal leak I cleaned it off 3 times between install and this picture with break cleaner. Will report it and get a replacement at this point. They need better testing, not what I would expect from Raybestos Pro product. Driver side rear is doing fine, just rusting. (Don't get me wrong it very light early stage.) Note to self. Get powered coated to next time.Updated RCS - 20180604

These were heavier than I expected.  Seem well built and the finish is good. My only issue was that the throttle side was a touch loose on my OEM honda twist throttle. Put a wrap of sports grip tape in twist throttle before I installed them and problem solved. I'm pretty pleased with the quality for the price.

I recently purchased/installed these tail light guards on my Jeep Wrangler JK.Aside from being incredibly simple to install (replace factory screws with included longer screws), they look very nice and are crafted from a pretty tough metal.We all know that these guys aren't really going to protect your tail light, aside from maybe a stick or two.I mean face it, if you have backed into a wall/huge tree/boulder enough to hit your tail lamps, you probably aren't going to explain, "Oh no! My tail lights!"You will likely be concerning yourself with your now mangled rear-door and wheel mount, or the fact that you just crunched your corner panels.What it does do though is make the tail light assemblies much more rugged looking, and they nicely trim the rear of the Jeep.The factory tail lamps are a bit plain compared to the rest of the vehicle, this is a perfect (and relatively cheap) way to remedy that...~Rusty

I see it asked a lot on how much can it bend. Well it can be bent in a 180. That is how it is in the box. But not a tight 180. The bend in the box is 3.5".They were smart in adding a circuit that cuts off the white when the yellow is lit. So if it is connected to a turn signal circuit, as the yellow flashes, you won't see white between each flash. The white will come back on about 1.5-2 seconds after the yellow is off.Come with small plastic clips and screws to attach clips. The clips snap into grooves on each side of the light tube.Simple to wire. Black is ground, white is power for white light, yellow is power for yellow light.Would be great if it was a little longer or a lot longer that you can cut every few inches and I have seen light strips that can be shortened.

These are awesome. The factory style is pathetic next to these. They install pretty easily.  It says you don't need to lift the truck to change them but I did and also removed the tire for more room to work. I highly recommend changing the sway bar bushings while you're changing these. They're cheap  and the stock rubber ones dry rot. Also, while urethane bushings are much better than the stock they will squeak. The end link kit does come with 2 small tubes of grease which I recommend using. They give you plenty for the endlinks and also enough if you are changing the sway bar bushings to grease those also. My only issue with these was where the link bolts to the axle the hole needed drilled out for the bolt to fit. Not a huge deal but I didn't see anywhere that said anything needed modified. Aside from that my only other issue with this is you have to assemble it. For the price, it should come pre assembled. I don't have a shop press so I just used a large C clamp and a small block of wood. It pressed right in without issue. Either way, these are great and crazy strong over the stock set up. I am 100% pleased. All the hardware is grade 10.9 and is extremely good quality. I can almost say it was enjoyable replacing these knowing I'll never have to fool with them again. Highly recommended. Just order them and do yourself a favor!

I recently bought 2 of these shackles for the Expedition One front bumper on my FJ. Compared to other shackles I've used, these sure look sharp (see added photo). The finish is smooth and shiny and the pin is easy enough to thread. The pin just barely fits through the attachment holes in the bumper, and I like that because there's no extra slop to cause a rattle. There were some adhesive stickers on them but they peeled off easily and left no residue. Considering the rated strength, nice finish and price I believe these are currently the best value here, at least for me. I'll have to wait some months and see how the finish holds up to trail, sun and weather exposure. I also have some galvanized shackles but the black looks better with black bumpers.

I use this on my 2012 Nissan Xterra.  I found it annoying to regularly have to take the metal one off when we went in to the woods (trying to avoid bending it on low hanging branches).  First we tried the Stubby brand antenna, which is only about 4 inches tall and rigid.  It worked well but I always had static on my favorite radio stations near my home about 45 minutes outside of DC.Then I found this little guy.  The 13in length gets me clear radio transmissions, no more annoying static.  It's flexible though and so I don't worry about it during our off road adventures.  One warning, it can bend back a few inches when traveling at highway speeds.  It doesn't damage the antenna or anything, but sometimes it can take a while (hours?) to bend back vertically once you've stopped the car.  No biggie, just thought I'd share.

These are extremely bright. I have a pair on each of my motorcycles I use as daytime running lights and night time supplemental lights. The pattern is rather broad (30 degrees). I have one pair mounted vertically. I have them angled down to keep from blinding cars ahead of me. On the other motorcycle I was able to mount them horizontally so the beam isn't as hard on the cars in front of me. I bought these to help cars notice me on the road. I'm thinking of swapping one from each pair for the matching 10 degree beams by the same manufacturer to give me better visibility at night and in foggy conditions.The four I received all seem to give off about the same temperature light at the same level of intensity.It is early days and these have not been in the rain. I'll update my review if I run into challenges.

After refinishing my calipers, I was very impressed with this paint. Easy to apply, provides a high quality shine, durable, and no discolouration. I painted both my rotor centers and calipers using the VHT produce. Calipers and carriers were red and the center of the rotor were black. The car was driven about 60,000km for about 3 years, the paint was still holding up great up until I sold it. Beyond daily driving, the car was exposed to some extreme braking as track events too.

Spend more money. If you plan to get it wet DON'T. Its a cheap winch. If thats all u want and you install it correctly it will work... Mine worked for about a year and a half. I spent $35 to replace the insides of the control box. I will not repair again i will buy a Warren.Update.. I found the solenoids shipped for $35. I put dielectric grease over all the connections. Works now but sounds need to be pulled apart and grease packed. In fairness i abuse my jeep and i clearly submerged the control box. But in a year and a half the few time i tested it it worked fine. The time i needed it i was out of luck.

I bought these for my 1996 XJ Cherokee 4x4. If you don't already know these are 1" wider than the factory wheels, so they may cause some rubbing when you are turning hard with XXX/75R15 tires or bigger. I took these to my local Firestone Service Center to be mounted, and when they went to do the alignment they told me an interesting thing. 3 of the 5 wheels I ordered were the same size, and 2 were different. They are all technically 15x8's, but two of them had a n inch larger internal diameter than the other three. Firestone said it was not an issue and they were still able to do the alignment, just odd. I'll post some pictures.

This is a well made Wheel Balancer; great design, great materials and solid build.  Assembly and setup was easy and straight forward.  Balancing my first wheel took about 20 minutes; but I have seen experienced people do it on balancers like this in less than 5 minutes.Of note, I have a Honda VFR with a single sided rear wheel.  The cones that come with this balancer would not work with this type of wheel.  I purchased the proper cones (and a new shaft) from Marc Parnes ( www.marcparnes.com ) and the balancing of this wheel went without a hitch; thanks Marc.Side note, I have not used the wheel alignment functions (spoke adjustment) of this balancer and cannot comment to there effectiveness.(Image shows separately purchased Cones and shaft)

Fit perfectly in my 2016 JK wrangler. My only reservation is how close it sits to the temperature guage cable on the radiator. It basically pinches that cable moving back the sheath a little. I wish they would have accounted for that a bit with their bracket. My other complaint is how spaced out the mesh is. I really wish it was a bit smaller to help deal a bit with bugs. I'm thinking of running a smaller mesh between this grille and the brackets. For the install you just need to make sure you press the grille insert HARD into the the Jeep grill then mark out the holes you need to drill for the bracket. If you don't push the grill in hard enough you will get gaps and a loose insert. Overall though for the $50 including shipping i paid, it cant be beat.

I use these on an SUV which I am unable to purchase custom mirrors for to pull a 8 foot wide travel trailer. With just my standard mirrors, the outside edge is just about 8 feet which means that especially with my drivers side mirror I cannot see anything down the side of the trailer. These mirrors attach very easily. Just a suggestion, measure up the elastic on these before installing them, then put it in a bit tighter. When you install these, you should be pulling the elastic a bit to clip them on to make sure the fit is snug. The mirror can be positioned in either a landscape or portrait fashion.The only thing I dislike about these is that they do vibrate a bit at highway speed. Although it is not too bad, it is certainly noticeable when looking down the side of the trailer for oncoming cars. As I said, this is not too bad though and having the convenience of looking down my trailer certainly outweighs the slight vibration I get on these mirrors.

When Im buying parts I mostly buy Moog Problem solver or equivalent.This was for a 2007 CorollaMoog on the right compared to OEM  sway bar link on the left.  Much more heftier.  The only issues I'd say with the item are as follows:The nuts are 18mm.  Not a common number typically with car repairs.  Most wrench sets don't include it unless its a complete set.The bolt is quite a bit longer than OEM.Otherwise it seems like a very high quality part and Im looking forward to seeing how it holds up.

IM PLEASED... EXTREMELY PLEASED..I love my 2015 GMC Sierra Crew Cab too much to mess something up and didn't wanna spend the money for professionals to do it but I figured what the heck, 100% bolt on no special tools required but 15mm wrench, a crescent wrench, and 2 sockets (18mm and 15mm). Let's proceed.First off the kit comes with 2 billet aluminum spacers, 4 bolts, 8 washers, 4 nuts, and instructions.INSTALL TIP: for ease of installment. I followed the youtube video "2010 Rough Country Leveling Kit Install" TO THE TEE! However when trying to pry the strut up there was an extreme amount of pressure and it just felt as though someone was gonna get hurt. Didnt feel normal. Well after about an hour of trying to watch every moving part while prying and also trying to observe what is happening as well as "what needs to happen" ..FINALLY WE SPOTTED THE PROBLEM... we noticed one important step missing in the video instructions that would make the install go from 1.5 hours to 20 minutes tops GAURANTEED,  WHICH IS JUST OUR OPINION. But if somehow you were able to get it by watching the video in this post and following those steps then most likely your here reading this because you broke something or messed something up and want to know of that easier way you could have done it.In the video they stated loosening and leaving the sway bar bolt loose. For us this was humanly impossible to pry the strut far enough away from the lower control arm to slip the spacer in safely. We simply unscrewed the top nut and removed it completely from the sway bar but left the bolt in place. Giving you MUCH more room to move strut up and down. Next we easily picked the strut up away from the control arm and placed the spacer in place and wiggled the pry bar back and forth to align holes to accept bolts. We used a small vertical hydraulic jack to crank the lower control arm up to allow bolt for sway bar to protrude through enough for nut to catch.Your also going to need the 7/32 allen to keep the ball joint from spinning when tightening your control arm nut. Also FYI the other side took us 12 minutes TIMED!!! Trust me just just remove the to nut completely from the sway bar. Now that we are finished and see the bigger picture of what we needed to do I consider this install a very very simple install probably a 2 or 3 on a 10 scale of difficulty.I don't ever post on anything but figured my two cents may save someone an hour of daylight. PLEASE GIVE THUMBS UP IF THIS REVIEW HELPED IN ANY WAY! Thanks God bless.Update 4/9/2017: Since I first wrote this article, I have since installed this kit on a number of trucks and SUVs. All were equally easy and came out nice! MOTOFAB is the way to go! Dont settle for anything less!! Other brands have packaging issues, broken parts, missing pieces, uneven bolts, long bolts, misthreaded bolts, unthreaded bolts, etc... MotoFab has an unmatched Quality Control department that ensures correct blemish free products."

Wasn't looking to spend top dollar since the Jeep I'm putting these on is just for some general romping around in the woods but wanted something better to see in the dark. These were a home run! Tremendous upgrade! Pretty much plug n play, just had to tuck the wiring into the stock opening behind the head light in the grill. I did learn afterwards that I should and will be upgrading the wiring by adding relays & and inline fuse since the ole jeep is wired direct to the switch, this is something you should do regardless of the headlight upgrade (cheap and easy to do). Very impressed with these and HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Especially compared to other high priced LEDs.Only slight con, the black bulges out slightly from the beauty ring, which you can see what I mean in one of the pics... but I honestly don't care one bit, they look and function phenomenally on this ole rust bucket!Two of the pictures show the new beams on the passenger side compared to the old sealed lamps, the difference is pretty obvious. Also the video starts out black on purpose, I also had to install a dimmer switch so it takes me a second or two to find it in the dark for the HI/LOW demo... and they could/should be even brighter once I get the relays in place.

Light is a good improvement visually over the OEM light and blends with the truck. Fit was perfect with no problems. Unfortunately i have to give 3 stars because some of the LED's don't work. Installed this morning and the 3 LED's on the drivers side don't light up, see attached photo. Unconnected and reconnected several times to no avail. Have contacted seller so I'll update as soon as it's resolved. Update: Seller contacted within a few minutes (actually before I finished typing this) and offered a replacement, upgraded to 4 stars. If I didn't have to uninstall and install another one it would be 5. Will update again when new one arrives.

This was delivered to me, yesterday. I put it on last night. It took aver 1.5 hours to get this to work. Unbelievable! Whoever measured, calculated and machined the bolt holes for this was off. It was a bear to install. I have never installed an appearance part on my bike that gave me so much trouble. I wound up damaging the bolt to the starter cover trying to get this to fit. I have 2 very small nicks due to this problem. As far as the appearance: it does not sit proper. Not level with trans, etc. I'm stuck with this because of the problems I had during install. I don't know how to get ahold of Kuryakyn as they don't deal with the "public". Not happy with this one, unfortunately.Buyer beware!UPDATE 08-21-'17: Not only have I never heard from Kuryakyn, it BROKE IFF AND FELL TO THE HIGHWAY TODAY!! A rider 3/4 mile behind me, saw " something" fall off of my bike. He caught up to me 12 miles later and pulled me over to ask me if I lost something. Unbelievable! And I have no idea why this broke off.UPDATE 8-21-17: AMAZON is sending out a new replacement. I will see how this works out. Thank you, Amazon.NOTE: 2 separate sellers on this EXACT part #. However, one says it fits my bike and one says it doesn't? Really? Confusing.

It's been about 3 weeks and so far I've already been amazed by this stuff. I did my rockers and bottom half of my truck and 3 days after found myself going down 8 miles of a newly stoned chipped road. Still 0 stone chips to this day. Application was surprisingly easy. Expect lots of prep time since your spraying. Took about 22 hours but I go to bare metal, apply rust neutralizer, primer, then the bed liner. I only used two coats and it recommends three.

Did not fit my GMC Savana 2003 van. Bilstein's fit guide on their own website, as well as Amazon's, says it will. The bottom bolt holes of the strut are too close together. Comparing the old strut taken off to this Bilstein strut (24-187435) the incorrect distance between the holes was easily apparent. I triple checked the part number on the part, box, and their fit guide. I wasted a lot of time, my van is without struts as I had to cut the old ones off, I have to go purchase new struts and I drive my wife's car until I get a chance to fix this problem.The first thing a part must do is that it must fit the vehicle! I have replaced the struts on this van many times and this is the first time I have ever had this problem.

I just purchased a 2005 Durango with the 5.7 Hemi so I bought this kit. The instructions could have been much better. For example, "Step 6 - Unclip the engine wire harness from the resonator box as shown" is unnecessary on an '05 Durango, they could have mentioned that. I often had to refer to the main exploded diagram to fill in information that is omitted in the individual steps. Also, the silicone crank case hose is at least 1" too short - even without fully seating it there is a restrictive bend, I'll have to purchase a longer one, and maybe an elbow connector to make up for the sharp turn it has to make. I took advantage of the exposed throttle body intake during the install to give it a nice cleaning.

Well, I changed the oil in my 2012 Ford Fiesta SES 5 speed manual today at 14188 original miles. My engine ought to be broken in by now. My three year factory warranty expired. Time to protect my investment for the long haul. This is my third oil change since I bought my car brand new. My previous two servicing's were done by my local Ford dealership. At the dealership prices. I suppose that the service techs used "Ford" products on my ride since they're a dealership......... Well back to the "Royal Purple" upgrade. After tricking out my Fiesta with the best that money could buy in the past, and after viewing all the available information that I could find, reading the car owner reviews, and seeing oil filters sawed in half, I decided that I would give "Royal Purple" a try. The 1.6L Ford Fiesta engine specs call for 4.2 quarts of 5w20 oil. After installing the new upgraded "Royal Purple" oil filter, I added the four quarts of Royal Purple 5w20 oil, and topped it off with .2 quarts of "Lucas Pure Synthetic" oil treatment.. I'm Very, VERY pleased with the results in my Ford Fiesta SES! My car runs so smooth and quiet that I have to listen to see if the engine is still running while driving down the road in gear! Now I'm not one to brag, but it DOES seem like there's MORE POWER. Whatever it is, I definitely noticed a faster acceleration without even trying to press the pedal harder to do it! This from a guy that has used over the last 40 years all the oils, gimmicks, gadgets, and snake oils on the market and some that are not even on the market anymore! This is an upgrade that went perfectly smooth, with no pain, and no modifications! After running the engine for about 3 to 5 minuets to circulate the new oil, I shut down the engine to check the oil level. Well that part was kind of hard to do. the oil on the dipstick had to be checked three times to make sure that I got it right. The oil level was perfect. The hard part was reading the dipstick! The oil was SO CLEAN that I could barely see it on the stick! I was surprised because the Royal Purple oil that I used is dark purple! I thought for sure that I would be able to see THAT on the dipstick! The filtering out of the color tells me that is one HELL of an oil filter people! Anybody that says Royal Purple products are bunk is sadly misinformed, or just plain stupid. I'll NEVER use any other oil or filter in my hot hatch!

First one came with a cracked pump housing and would not produce pressure. Amazon promptly replaced it, though the universal kit still did not work very well on my first generation Tacoma. After trying a couple dozen orientations (moving the chain, tightening one J hook high and one low, moving the large rubber gasket around, etc) I could not get it to maintain pressure. I just worked extremely quickly (had to re-pump a couple times at each corner) and it got the job done.

As other people have noted, this item is extremely difficult to install, may be it would require the removal of the air bag? Once I was able to have the top half installed, the lower portion left a gap between the trim and the dashboard. This is unacceptable for a part that is "GM". I read quite a few good reviews, so I guess it is a hit or miss... I guess I will have to end up paying the local dealership to do something that should take 10 minutes top. That way they can weed out the garbage units and I will be able to have a decent fit in my truck.

These have worked great so far and I see no reason to believe that will change anytime soon. Easy install, so I'm not going to go into that too much. Literally took about 30 minutes to install them both. I'll explain the relevant parts that make this such a great product for my pickup. Factory setting, unloaded, I had 36.5 inches from the ground to the middle of the outside edge of the rear wheel wells. When I placed 420 lbs on the towing hitch, the pickup squatted to 35 inches. With the SSR-610-40 SumoSprings installed, the unloaded height went to 37 inches, which is a secondary benefit that I did not expect and welcomed with open arms. When placing 420 lbs back onto the hitch, the pickup squatted only to 36.5 inches. This is exactly what I was looking for and it has improved all aspects of towing my boat. And shockingly, the unloaded ride is not noticeably harsh. The pickup has a firmer unloaded ride, but I would not say that it is stiff or harsh at all. Honestly, barely noticeable to me. I hope this helps other Tacoma owners with the decision if they are looking for a product to reduce some of the squat when towing.

For $7 I really wasn't expecting much but right off the bat I noticed the lights I received did not even match... one came like the picture and the other had a round edge to it instead of the flat edge. Another small thing to note is the "metal" looking plate is plastic and looks nothing like the picture, and the wires are yellow and black. I tested the one shown in the picture and it was barely visible in daylight, rendering it useless. Because of this, I will not be reordering this item, just returning it.

I live in Florida where it is almost always hot. I am constantly burning my fingers on the steering wheel when I first get into the car. I also have a new car and I want to keep it clean and covered as much as possible. This Zone Tech Plus Sheepskin steering wheel cover accomplishes both of these things.It comes curled up and you may have to work to get it on your steering wheel at first. However, once it is on and stretched to the steering wheel it is easy to move on and off again. It fit my Kia Forte perfectly. The cover is really fluffy and comfy on the hands. It felt a little weird the first day because I have become accustomed to the hard plastic of the wheel. After the second day however, I loved it. I definitely like this cover and I would highly recommend it. I won't have any more burned fingers and if we do ever have cold days in Florida (Ha!) it will keep my hands warm.*I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

Installed on the Ram truck just fine. Pretty easy to install and works as described. Took maybe 1/2 hour to 45 minutes. This sure beats lugging a step stool around. The hardest part of the install was taking the bumper brace off which is required to install the step on a 2013 Ram truck. This has nothing to do with the product but Ram made it hard to access the bumper brace attaching nuts so it is open end wrench time turning 1/4 turn at a time. Seems to be well made and should hold up under Oregon weather. This should make hooking up the trailer plug or getting in the truck bed a lot easier.

I put these on my 06 Mustang GT after having put a front pair on another car and loved them. They go on just as OEM parts with no extra hassle. It did take me extra time as I decided to paint the calipers at the same time. I was very happy with the outcome. I had no issues with the clips that others had mentioned. Braking performance seems about the same as stock but if nothing else, they look a lot better. The rotors weigh about the same as stock. I believe the drilled design would help cooling under heavy use. The price is about the same as stock non drilled/slotted rotors and decent pads.

If your going back and forth between this bag and the other bag (Classic Accessories 74877 Hitch Tote), get the other one, this one is crap. The material used is a very thin, paper-like material that you sometimes see items wrapped in during shipping. I was thinking (hoping?) it was nylon or gym bag-like material, but it's not. It's not very puncture proof. Also, there are no pockets or dividers, not really a big deal, just FYI.

These are great bulbs that have NO hint of yellow in them! White with a hint of blue. These are slightly brighter than stock so don't expect HID performance. I have these on my high beams and they match my 6000k HID's. Since these are higher wattage than standard bulbs you must get a "Heavy Duty Ceramic Wiring" harness specifically for your bulbs. It's a matter of plugging in an extra cable to the back of the bulb and harness. This will prevent your stock harness from burning up and only costs about $10 extra. It's really easy to install. I am not sure how long these will last only time will tell. Just make sure you are wearing clean latex/rubber gloves when installing these. Do not get any liquid, dirt, or oil on the bulb.Great bulbs for the money!

A nice addition to any vehicle.  The set comes in two. Although I wish I didn't have to cut the outer ring to fit into my cup holders, it was super easy and quick. I used a pocket knife. I think I could have done a better job with scissors.  Outside of that, the white is crisp and clean.  No issues or complaints. The directions say to NOT use this as a regular coaster on furniture.

So, anything that has to get fixed bc of cheaply made material, loses 2 stars. Other than that, I like it. The part that broke, rather quickly, was the headrest. It's made out of cheap boarding that broke apart at both mounting points, rendering it a flat creeper. So I cute a square out of some 1/2" plywood I had, pulled all the staples out of the vinyl covering, matched up the drill holes, and made a new headrest. For a material that I don't feel saves them much more than $1, they're really cutting corners on that garbage. The main board is probably made out of the same cheap crap, but since you're not putting your weight on two corners of it, mine has yet to break. Two pictures uploaded, the first is the cheap board stripped down, with the two corners missing where the hinges snapped it off. The second is the back of the plywood board after I put it all back together, stapled the vinyl back down, etc.EDIT:It lost another star because the main "body" board also snapped in two. And I weigh 185. The metal frame seems to be good, the cardboard they use in between, junk.

Nice slim key organizer. I took a pic of the side profile with the extension screws installed so you could get an idea of the size. It's much slimmer without the extensions. There are rubber o-rings near the screw heads to stop them from unscrewing. It also came with plenty of extra washers to install between the keys so they flip out easier. The slate finish is a shade darker and bluer than the manufacturer picture but it still looks nice. At $20 it seems a bit pricey in my opinion. But, nevertheless, it's a good product. My coworker has one longer than me and the anodized finish is beginning to wear off of his (like the slate colored iPhone 5, if you know what I mean). That's why I docked a star.

This hood lock works great and is just as advertised!  There are reviews on here that state that someone could reach around the lock and swing the hood latch off the locks arm.  I have a 2014 wrangler, and after the install, I see no way to do what they claim.  The back housing of the lock is open, but the way the housing itself is shaped, it fits tight to the radiator. There is 0 room for someone to get their fingers around it.  Those reviews that say otherwise may have different model jeeps the hood lock is not meant for.  Other than that, the install was very simple ( around 15 to 20 minutes) that nearly anyone could do.  The lock is very solid.  When removing the key after locking, it does take a little giggle to get the key loose, but it really is no big deal.  If you are looking for an affordable and solid jeep hood lock, this is it.

On the plus side, this little compressor has its own little zipper case. It is easy to connect and easy to run when you push the power button. It does seem to pump fairly quickly. However, there are other buttons and it can be hard to figure out what to do with them. I pushed one of the buttons accidentally taking me to some kind of mode where I wasn't sure what I was doing. There is a sheet of instructions in the top pocket of the case. Unfortunately, although it appears to be written in three languages, English doesn't appear to be one of them. I realize that we live in a multilingual world but shouldn't English be one of the languages, especially if you title the product using English?  They wrote in English the name and description of what the product was and the statement that the tire pressure readings on the product should not be construed as accurate and I should double check. This got me concerned enough that I stopped by my local service station and used their tire pressure device. If the directions and warnings are written in your language, feel free to add a star to my rating.

So I gotta admit, at first I was mad when I got this because I couldn't figure out how to get this onto my car. However, after a little bit of a struggle I finally figured out how to get this to fit my car. Since I figured that out it has been smooth sailing and clean windshields. These are high quality wipers that get the job done. The construction is a bit stronger than the rainx wipers I had on my car before. They have a pretty stable metal frame that keeps the blade straight, whereas my rainx blades were mostly rubber and flopped around everywhere. All things said and done, I'm glad I bought these wiper blades and will most likely get these again when I need to replace them. I got these wiper blades at a discount in return for an honest review.

The mirrors look good, and the install was easy, BUT one of the mirrors fell out of the housing the first time I rode my bike after installing them! I was only going 45 MPH on a smooth paved road! I was riding along, and felt something hit my hand; I just thought it was a bug, and forgot about it until I went to change lanes, checked my mirrors, and realized that the one I needed wasn't there! I had to (VERY UNSAFE) turn my head and look behind me to make sure the lane was clear so I could get over.. I expected better than this after reading the reviews, and seeing how well the mirrors (appeared) to be made on removing them from the box, and installing them. VERY DISAPPOINTED...

I received these floor mats as a Christmas gift and they are as describe.  The only complaint i have about them is that they were just placed in a small box that they had to be bended and folded to fit inside.  This caused the mats to be warped and when i installed them the front mats for the passenger and driver side are not flush on the sides. After 3 months of using them there original shape never returned. Does not fit like a glove. Carpet is exposed where it shouldn't be and gets dirty where it should be protected.

These  JDM ASTAR LED's are a great replacement for the 1156A bulb that fails frequently on the Lexus GX470.  This bulb is used as the DRL and the turn signal.  If you don't mind the rapidly blinking turn signal, then this is all you need to replace the bulb with a very bright LED.  If you don't want your signals flashing rapidly, add a resistor to each bulb.  Be cautioned that the resistor gets VERY HOT.  Because this bulb is operating all the time as your DRL during the day, those resistors get extremely hot.  Be sure that when you install the resistors, that you mount them away from any wire harnesses or plastic pieces under the hood.  I have included a picture of how much brighter these JDM LED's are compared to my previous LED's (which were about the same as the OEM 1156A).  I have installed JDM ASTAR LED's on my other vehicle's over the years, and they are far and away a better product than the other LED's I have tried.  I have not had a JDM bulb fail on me yet, and their brightness and colors are outstanding.  If you have tinted rear windows, look into their clear backup light bulb replacements. They are fantastic!

Great product! Install was a breeze. It comes already pre-programmed. You can change the settings with small button. It is very bright and comes with everything you need. It is truly plug and play. I have not had it in the rain, but I have no reason the think it would be affected by bad weather. It comes with all wiring components which are weather proofed. I have gotten compliments about it and have been told how bright it is. It is definitely worth the money.

Worked as it should. I was under the impression this starter came with the two mounting bolts. Perhaps, I was looking at another post.This product was installed on a Mercruiser 4.3LX/ V6 . Shipping was received withing two days. It was delivered early and gave me plenty of time to install it that same day. Very happy customer!The image to the left is the new starter and the one on the right is the old one. The new starter looks to be made of the same quality or higher than the OEM. I definitely recommend this product. I read some reviews that were negative, I did not have the same experience as them, what I did was label each wire with tape and on what pole. Also, some said it did not turn on, well they might have to replace the fuse on their motor as well. Good luck and if you have any question, just ask.

If you are even THINKING of replacing the lower intake gaskets or the water pump on your 3800 engine...BUY THESE.  The OEM are plastic and WILL break.Simple to install.  Make sure you remove all traces of the old elbows as they like to leave the O rings and plastic tips behind.  Gently pry out with a screwdriver or thin blunt object, clean the holes out of any Dexcool crud, lubricate the O rings on these with a dab of grease and you are home free.  Attach to the Bracket and slide in.  The next time you need to do the job, it will come apart in one piece!  Totally worth the price.

Filled it with oil and gas, Turned the key and it would start and stall a couple times then it ran great. I used a 1500 watt heater for a test and honestly you can hardly hear it from 10 feet away (on the plug end of the unit) The exhaust is a bit loader but still quiet. The manual covers the basic and doesn't mention the remote start but with a couple trys and I figured it out. The specs on this unit are all over the place from site to site but on the unit it claims 3000 watt run with a 3100 watt surge. I haven't loaded it completely yet. I will be using this unit a couple times a week all summer at car shows so I'll post updates now and then.UPDATE 2017: This Generator has started to act up now but In all honesty it has been  run hard on every summer weekend since I bough it in 2013 so I can't complain at all. the generator still runs but has had 2 throttle linkage assemblies put in and an  inverter. Last year after the last throttle linkage was installed the generator surges and over heats so I changed the inverter to see if the throttle control was bad but nope. I'm now thinking it's a vacuum leak and will try that when the weather break in the spring. My only real complaint is that parts are not easily found. I had to buy parts from another manufacturer and they fit! All in all still a great generator for the money!

Bought Two of these February 2014. I placed one in the front bumper and second placed rear bumper. Around June I noticed the colors of the Flag were starting to fade. It was the rear most noticeable. Then the front followed. Today November 23,2014 I took Pics and the front frame is not only fading but the Metal Plated Flag was coming off the frame.  I really like this plate and I would have given 4 stars because of fading. The Metal Plated Flag coming off made me give it three stars. There are more things hitting the front  frame (wind, rain, dust, pebbles and occasional insects) than the back frame so the elements  would do more "wear and tear". I get it. but still that's my opinion should have been more sturdy. Hope this helps someone?

I am loving our new key holder! I love the Home built into it for a nice warm touch. It has 5 hooks for your to hang your keys & other things. I actually hung our keys,selfie stick, glasses, & sunglasses. This is very sturdy and high quality key holder. This is definitely not flimsy at all. They also provide the hardware(2 screws) to install it. It is the perfect size, just about 8 1/2" by 5".The hooks are created so nothing will slide off the hook they are flat but create a nice hook that goes up instead of curved. I would definitely recommend this because of the high quality material & sturdiness.*Sample was provided to me during a free promotional offer for the product, in exchange for my honest & unbiased evaluation.

Installed easily and now I have a way to shut-off power to my winch.  I wired this to a switch pod in my Jeep so I did not have a need for the wiring harness ( so I cannot speak to how the wiring kit would have worked). I have not tried it with a load yet, I will update when I do. I used the Apollotech switch pod and it came with the switch over.

I bought this locally for the same price but wanted to leave a review for others. While I wasn't thrilled this was made in China, I can at least tell you it's very strong. It didn't bend at all when two very-strong 30 year olds had the end of it, tightening a hitch ball. Bought this with a 24" Olympia adjustable wrench to hold the ball. If you put the hitch on sideways you can rest the adjustable wrench on the ground.

I tried this on a leather leg bag and it works great.  The lotion absorbs very quickly to a semi-gloss sheen.  There is absolutely no greasy or oily residue while maintaining its subtle shine.  It has a subtle, sweet, tropical fragrance that would not be overpowering if you were to do the interior of your vehicle with it.  I will definitely purchase in the future.

Works well but go slowly! Purchased and used on a small window A/C condensor to straighten the air exchange fins after being damaged from objects striking it. The 'comb' has many sizes in one tool, measured in 'fins per inch' so carefull select the size by placing the comb to the fins. Once you selected the correct size, start at the top and slowly pull the 'comb' down the fins whereby straightening them back for maximum airflow and heat transfer. This may take several passes to get the results desired but it does work as can be seen in the attached photos. This is not an expensive commerical tool being plastic but should last for many repairs around a home, RV, etc.  At a reasonable price, I'd recommend this tool.

Tried couple OBD scanners and this one is my favorite. It's compact, responses fast and the screen is easy to read. The Live Data gives you the real time readings from various sensors, including the voltages of Oxygen sensors. I use this OBD scanner every time when I need to diagnosis something on my cars, and it has been successfully identified the issues.(Picture) One day I got a CEL when I started up my car. The scanner gave me a "P0037" code, which indicated the code was from the downstream oxygen sensor. Checked the live data to confirm the sensor was not working properly. So I ordered a new oxygen sensor from Amazon and replaced it. It took me only 10 minutes with proper tools. Now the CEL is gone and I am very happy with the result.

Pictures added showing lifting eye, 6-3-2014.I bought mine at Tractor Supply because Amazon didn't have any when I was ready to purchase.Right out of the box, started first time (as it does all the time). Fairly easy to pull to start, if you have a shoulder or an arm problem, it might be more difficult.I've been using mine for about a month and a half, (10 plus hours), no complaints. Motor runs at full speed all the time, does not have an idle down feature like the Miller version for about $800 plus more. This one has the wheel kit included, nice. I added the quick connectors for the cable, makes it really convenient for adding / removing the cables. (about $30)Great for occasional use, well made sturdy machine, and heavy. Would like to have had an hour meter as standard, but I did add one to it for around $30. (comes standard on the Miller)Great for the home, farm, ranch where you need the portability. If you need it for everyday, I'd suggest spending a lot more for a more substantial machine.July 5th UP-DATE....Have been using mine periodically, probably have about 20 hours on it. Works great, no complaints, still starts with one pull. I made a lifting eye for it similar to the one you can buy for $125. Mine cost about $10 in materials and about 2-3 hours of my labor which is "FREE". I carry my welder with my tractor bucket hook to the location I need it. Highly recommend this option either factory or homemade.August 17th UP-DATE....Still running strong, no complaints. Starts with one pull everytime as long as there is no "pilot error" (forget to switch on) Been welding a lot of 16ga pipe with 3/32 6011. Tricky but gets the job done. I'm not an expert but welds come out nice.April 30, 2014 update.....A year has gone by, welder still starts with one pull, overall very happy with it. The frame seems a little light for moving over rough ground, but is adequate for most of the time. Maybe when I run out of projects, I'll build a heavier frame for it, but if you're careful when moving it, will last just fine. Having a portable welder allows me to tackle jobs I couldn't have done before.

A little time bumdled with patience, makes this installation easy.  I drive a 2003 Avalanche.  Speeds 3 and 4 for the AC stopped working.  Replaced the speed controller box last year for speeds 1 and 2, and that resolved it.  Replacing it this year did not.  The resistor is new too, along with a recent purchase of a new AC compressor and blower.  I removed the pigtail cabling (a tip I found in the comments for a new resistor here on Amazon), and found two burned spots.  Today, I made myself two sets of labels, numbers 1 through 7, and adhered them to the existing cabling and the replacement.  Luckily, I own a heat gun so that I could meld the couplers to the cables.  I now I have all of my AC/Heat fan speeds.  This was an investment purchase in my book.  I needed this financial break after recently spending $641 on a new compressor and blower motor.

Happy with it.  Great product.Some observations:It comes with a sleeve and pins that attached to a plastic plate on the rear of the trunk (not shown in product pictures).  Unfortunately, the sleeve is not long enough for my bike's passanger's back rest.  And the velcro straps, however, are not adjustable.  It comes with a few hooks to tie in, but it depends on your bike's frame/design how you are going to secure it.

Seems like a great bar....heavy, but, if the ends break on the hollow OEM bars, what's the point?  I especially appreciated that the bar is marked "Driver Side, Bottom" on the appropriate end to aid in installation. Product was nicely packaged and labeled.Many reviewer's reported less than satisfactory performance of Dorman's "rubber" sway bar bushings included with the bar.  A size check on the dormanproducts.com website shows that the bar diameter is 33 mm.Like others I considered Moog's K80815 sway bar bushing kit as an upgrade....Moog has ASE certified technical customer service representatives available to answer customer questions:  The diameter of the hole in Moog's K80815 sway bar bushing kit is 34.5 mm, versus a smaller hole diameter of 32mm for the K80814 kit. ( Bar is 33mm )The hole on the K80815 kit is 1.5 mm larger than the Dorman bar; a loose fit approx. 1/16" loose would result. The hole in the K80814 kit is 32 mm which means it would be "snug" fit, tight by just over 1/32" when installed on the 33mm dia. sway bar.Moog's ASE Certified technician stated that he would always choose to go "snug" versus "loose" to help prevent lateral bar movement and potential wear to sway bar bushings, etc.I'll bet he's right, he seemed very credible.  Thought I'd pass this information along to customers desiring an upgrade via Moog's sway bar bushing kit(s) when purchasing the Doorman 927-100 sway bar.( I personally chose to go with the smaller Moog kit, figuring I'd have the Dorman sway bar bushings that came with the bar as a backup if there were problems.)( Note: Amazon's website is suggesting the K80815 Moog kit;  also, the Amazon description had a "note" stating "30 or 32mm"....still don't know what that refers to! ).

Have had this on my truck for over a year. Looks great... if you install it properly most can't tell where the grill starts an the shield stops... it looks like it's part of the grill... this is a stone guard more than a bug shield... i don't  believe this will keep the bugs off the windshield... I don't believe they claim that it will... It is very flexible... i installed it by myself and a couple pieces of painters tape... start on one side and pull the 3M tape of the back securing (pressing) it to the hood... use a soft microfiber towel in the hand you are pressing it on with. It looks great have had people say they thought it was a factory part of the grill.

Shipped quickly, packaged well, great price and are a perfect replacement for the originals. My only complaint is that one of the bulbs has a broken mounting tab, but it's one of the small tabs, so it still holds fine. If I could knock off only half a star for that, I would. Removal of the old (one broken) lights and replacement with these was a breeze!

Ordered 2 of these, installing flexible solar panels on top of a 2004 TRD Tacoma and a 2007 Tundra, with aux batteries. This all in one box is the ticket. Was able to screw it into the side of the truck bed with sheet metal screws.  I did not get the smart pass, since I only have one 108aH battery for 200w of solar panels for each truck. It will be powering a fridge and occasionally a laptop and charging phones etc. I can read the incoming voltage with my voltmeter and it regulates the incoming solar voltage, and outputs a charging voltage to the battery, and isolates the starter battery from the system when alternator not running. A nice, magic, all in one box. Read the manual so you know that it is not reverse charge protected!

I know there's been some talk by other reviewers about the maximum output of this device. The manual says "450A" and not 500 as the product page states.But, this shouldn't deter anyone from looking at the quality that this package offers.The set comes with:* Power Bank* micro SD cable* car battery charging cable* mobile device charging cable* cigarette charger cable*** Features ***+The battery has two outputs for mobile devices 1A and 2.1A+ For the car battery, this battery offers an output of 12V/ 16V/19V+ Flashlight+ Emergency blinkers+ Carrying case with a keychain lock.Beside having this set as an emergency automotive tool, this is great for long trips and outdoor activities like camping or an expedition.Also, this lithium ion battery has to be "conditioned" which is to fully charge to fully drain without a mid-cycle usage. This cycle continues for a total of 5 times. What this does is to stretch and strengthen the battery cells so that they operate at their highest capacity. This definitely should be done for a battery that would sit for an untold period of time in the trunk of a car.

I wanted a portable, reliable, high quality, quick & powerful tire inflator.  This product has all of those qualities in spades!  It is probably way more compressor than I need for my three passenger vehicles: a small commuter car, a minivan and a full size van.  This obviously durable product comes with a quality carrying/storage case.  It inflates fast!  Do not walk away from this product while it is in use (there is no auto-shutoff and, again, for normal size passenger tires it will quickly raise pressure).  It is also surprisingly quiet while operating compared to the cheap inflator I purchased at Lowe's (two of which broke down on me in as many years, which prompted my search for a quality product).This is easily a 4.5 star product, but I'm consciously choosing to not round up to 5 stars because there are some design flaws that should be addressed:1) The 25' long extension coil hose that comes included is really only going to give you 12 feet or so of working distance (i.e. for those working solo).  You won't be comfortable stretching the coil out all the way.  Even if you tried, the tension would cause the portable compressor to be dragged around on the ground.  You can get further distance with a second person - one to hold & operate the compressor and one to attach the tire chuck & read the pressure gauge (keeping hold of the coil to relieve tension from the tire valve).  I understand that these coiled hoses are designed to operate this way, but ideally the power cord, the coiled hose itself, or both would be longer.  The easiest solution would be to double the length of the power cord - it is not bulky and the carrying case would easily accommodate the added length.  The current design is unable to reach from my full-size van's battery to the opposite rear tire.  Another reviewer provided the ingenious solution of using jumper cables to extend the working distance of the portable compressor - it was a brilliant suggestion that worked perfectly for me!2) Oddly, the clamp-on tire chuck ("lever style tire chuck") is a bit deep.  What I mean is that the tire valve must be inserted into the chuck quite far for it to engage properly to allow air flow.  I purchased this particular Viair model in large part because I wanted the clamp-on style chuck versus a screw-on connection.  Unfortunately, my van has chrome valve stems (see picture) that are beveled just enough, such that I cannot get the tire chuck on far enough to properly engage.  My solution was to purchase an adapter (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fafada-Motorcycle-Motorbike-Tyre-Valve-Extender-Adapter-Car-Bike-2-Pcs-Pair-90-Degree/dp/B017CW5S9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fafada Motorcycle Motorbike Tyre Valve Extender Adapter Car Bike 2 Pcs/Pair (90 Degree)</a>), but that means I'm back to a screw-on connection.  Too bad - it seems like being able to insert the entire threaded portion of the Schrader valve into the tire chuck should be enough, but it's not.3) One must turn the compressor off to get an accurate tire pressure reading.  The power switch is, naturally, on the compressor, but the pressure gauge is way over at the tire.  The whole 25' coil is pressurized at the same pressure as the tire.  It would make more sense to install the gauge at the end of the coil that attaches to the compressor (where the on/off switch is).  This would make for better control and easier monitoring.  A longer hose or power cord as discussed above would make this a non-issue.The three flaws above are the difference between an excellent product and a perfect product.  While they prevent me from giving a perfect 5 star rating, they should not deter anyone from purchasing this excellent portable compressor.

Much sturdier than most reviews had led me to believe. I'm very satisfied with quality.For my specific application (2013 Lancer GT), I had to cut off the uppermost mounting lip because it caused the lip to not sit flush with the bumper. That limited me on how far out the lip could protude, but ultimately I'm happy with it.Mine came in a large, flat, thin box, and was also wrapped in plastic. It was completely undamaged, and I found the self tapping screws included with it to be sufficient to mount it for now. I may drill to bolt it to the bumper later to help ensure it can take a hit, though hopefully it doesn't come to that.

This exhaust is really nice, has a nice deep sound under 4K, then gets more aggressive as it goes up from that. I run it without the baffles, used the baffles once a but it didn't sound as nice. The build quality seems to be holding up so far for a month and almost 1000 miles. No leaks and only took 40 minutes with a partner. It does have a slight whistle without the baffles around 5k rpm but it's not too noticeable and sounds more like a turbo lol

I build a 48x48 square frame to mount on the roof for my last setup. This light bolted on nicely. The light is remarkably bright, and I cant live without the safety of it on back roads and the convenience of making daylight anywhere.But the lense now has water droplets on the inside. This isn't too big of a deal to me because I planned on changing the lense with a tempered glass one and resealing it.I wish it had more spotlight than flood, and the hinges on the bracket aren't really good for on.the.fly. adjusting because you have to loosen it for it to move and tighten it for it to maintain position.Definitely worth the 95 dollars I got it for (it was on sale)It comes with a relay remote (with on and off leds) its been a couple months and im very pleased!

I have to say that I expected a bit more brightness from these halogens. The light they emit is around 5000 kelvin which is much closer to day light. The color is perfect in my opinion but the lumen output isn't quite as penetrating as regular oem halogens which are 3000 Kelvin because they have higher tendency to reflect objects. In dark conditions they work very well but a road full of street lights will quickly over power these bulbs. However, I DID know that to be a trade-off for having whiter halogens. I also really like the effect they have in reflector housings as they produce a subtle but noticeable blue tint when the bulb is not powered.Overall I am very satisfied. I've accomplished my goal to get rid of the tacky oem yellow bulbs but sacrificed some luminosity. One can simply not compare these to HID's if that is your intent but DO NOT let that deter you from these bulbs. They are certainly an upgrade.Thanks for reading! Hope the pictures help...

The seats in our 1972 jet boat were bad but I wasn't willing to spend over $1900 on getting them reupholstered.  Instead, spent about $250 which will give me some time before replacing them completely.  I am shocked at how well this stuff works, looks, and feels.  No one can tell the difference between this and real vinyl.  The only reason why I will probably still replace the seats in the future is because of stitching issues...otherwise, this would be a perfect permanent solution.  I used about 10 cans of white and 2 cans of blue for the piping.  Because I was going from a darker color to lighter, I feel that I had to apply more coats.  I also used the prep soap and prep spray before painting, and tac free aerosol (after the seats had cured 5 days).Some before and after pics:

As advertised, easy to assemble and performs great. It looks like the stock Ford emblem in daylight. At night the word "Ford" lights up red and gets brighter when brakes are applied. It will flash when turn signals and 4-way flashers are activated. It would be nice to have an additional 6" of wiring to loop in back of the receiver instead of hanging as pictured but overall I like it!

The mirrors seem sturdy, give a much better view than the stock missors and look great on my 1999 F-250. Auto Dynasty has great customer service. I had to contact them twice. One time about the shipping being late and another time in regard to a defect in one of the four mounting screws (it had no threads cut in it, see pic).  Customer service offered to replace the mirrors if I wanted to return them. I declined. I cut new threads on  the blank screw with a #6 metric die and so I could install the mirror. Auto Dynasty did give me a $25 refund for my inconvenience.A few improvements should be made to this product:1. Quality control at the factory should check that all screws have the proper threads.2. Instructions for installation should be included.3. There is a plastic tab on the inside of the mirror bracket that needs to be removed before a flush installation can be achieved, I broke them off with a pliers and then filed them flush. This tab should be removed at the factory.I will update this review as time goes on if any new issues occur with this product.

Awful. Terribly awful. The second I applied it it started taking the red off of my leather seats, and yes I waited the three days. Furthermore, it immediately became a white wax that flaked off, which made the leather look bad and got flakes all over my car. Was this because it was cold? If it was because it was cold, then there is no way this stuff could be used in a car.

This cup holder is a huge improvement over the one I had in my 2001 GTI VR6. It has rubber bottoms and sides so the cup does not slip and the arm that holds the side of the cup is spring loaded to adjust to different sizes. The operation is smooth and easy. It looks just like OEM and fits like a glove. Removal of my old one and installation of the new one literally took me 30 seconds.

Gas shock doesnt want to stay on. This is the fourth Dee Zee tailgate assist I have bought, and this is the only one to do this. Nothing I can see will correct the issue.Update: the retaining clips supplied are broken and won't allow the gas shock to grab the ball securely. Ive looked for replacement clips and cant seem to find any. Lowered the review to one star due to Dee Zee not wanting to send replacement clips, even if I pay for them and not being able to find parts to support the product.

I bought this to fix the classic clunky steering on my 2005 Silverado.  I replaced this bearing and the original shaft with Dorman parts.  After replacing both, No more clunky steering.  I will warn whomever buys this bearing part that pushing it in place is not easy.  As others recommended you should grease it up good first and you will need to wiggle and push to get it in.Also do not try to remove it after you have pushed it in part way.  I had started it in and decided I should add more grease so tried to pull it out and the bearings and bushing came out of the main housing and got stuck on the shaft.  Luckily the small ball bearings are seated in a ring so they didn't fly apart, however the bushing that holds the bearings in place got stuck on the shaft.  I was able to pull the inner bushing back off the shaft that it was stuck on.  See my attached picture.  I was able to snap everything back together and finally push it in place.

Good attempt but it falls short. The battery life is about 6 hours in my use, which is about 3 gym session, which I knew ahead of time. The weight is okay but they do feel a bit heavy on the ears. Forget about using them for running as they will fall out. These will fall out during sit ups. The worst thing about these is the power cable. Good luck charging the headphones. I have short manly nails and there is no way you can get the rubber strip off. I've had to use a knife everytime. Overall. These are price correctly for the price.

I purchased this to cover subwoofers I plan on installing in cargo area....wish there was an insert to put a cardboard cutout or something to make it stiffer.. Or maybe a dyi project for me... A little expensive at over $70... Would be perfect at under $50...

Just got the kit in the mail and what do expect for $35. There is no way this kit qualifies as a heavy duty puller kit. This is a joke. This would be an ideal tool for a lawnmower tech. The tips for the shaft are so small they are useless. Seriously do not buy this kit, do not waste your money or your time. I don't know what I'm going to do with this.

As I read other reviews, I see others stating stuff about windshield wipers or knobs or something.  Im writing this review about this set of piston ring compressor tools.  These tools are terribly made, no quality control.  The tack welds caused slag on the inner diameter of the sleeves.  These slag welds will cause detrimental damage to any engine piston rings.  And the edge of every compressor ring has a razor sharp edge on them.  Should have been deburred.  Anyhow, Im gonna keep these tools and fix the issues because returning these things back is prolly gonna be a hassle.

I got a chip in my windshield a few weeks ago and after reading the reviews I'm glad I went with this Blue-Star product. Worked as advertised and I did my repair on a dry 50 degree day here in the great northwest. The rock chip was about 3/4" wide or so right in my field of view. The product works great and I can hardly even see it now even when I try too. I followed the directions exactly except for the last step that says to park it in the sun for X amount of time, I left mine outside in the cold"ish" sun for a few hrs to cure. Very happy, I attached a before and after picture "I think".

The jacket was dusty when I received it. It must have been stored for a while. I took a washcloth and wiped the jacket down. The fit is very stiff and my shoulders look like a quarter back. I deff have to let the jacket loosen up.Leather is very thick, it fits perfect for my size. I ordered the Large and it fits to a T. I would recommend if you like jackets fitted. If you want a little room then go up a size.I wouldn't recommend this for a women larger then a size 12. If your a big chest women. I wouldn't recommend this jacket either. I'm a size 36C and I usually wear a medium. One side up for very good.

Great vinyl.  This is the second decal I put on my car, after removing my last one for a yearly change.  This one is especially good.  I call it my warning rattlesnake.  Gives others a little warning to the person inside.  It went on easily and is so detailed it looks great.  The white stands out on my dark windows, and matches the white of the car.  It is classy and people who know what it means, can identify the kind of person I am.I personally used a paper cutter, and sliced off the "Don't Tread On Me."  The vinyl came in a sturdy envelope, with some practice vinyl, a company vinyl, and application directions.  Went on in 2 minutes after I cleaned the area/window.  Buy in confidence...

This worked perfectly for my need.  I wanted a less obtrusive foot on my jack (had a wheel) for better clearance, wanted something small yet effective.  Trailer is light-duty for hauling around a couple of quads.  This foot mounted easily to the shaft and did exactly what I needed.  At $4 shipped, can't go wrong.Actual dimensions are: 2-1/4" x 4-1/2" x 1-1/2".  Heavy-duty stamped steel.See attached pictures for relative size comparison, installed on trailer jack.

Bought these bulbs to replace stock fog lights and they look really sharp, but now I have to upgrade my headlights on my 06 Ford Ranger which is going to suck because it's got DRLs.We did get a round of really really thick fog last week (I couldn't see more than 30 feet in front of me at times) so I was cycling my fogs on and off to see how well they did.  They seemed to illuminate the fog more than bust through it so I may need to move to HID for my fog lights.  I got HIDs in another vehicle of mine and when it rained I could only see the drops on the ground and on the window, but not the drops falling thanks to the wavelength of light created by HID.  The wavelength of light created by HID are not reflected back by water, but pass right through it which is what gave such clarity while driving in the car, and I believe LEDs create the wavelength of light that is reflected which gave the illuminating effect on the fog, much like halogen lights in the rain.I can say that these LED fog light bulbs really do look good though so I've got no plans on pulling them unless I do for sure move to HID fog lights.

Installed on 2007 dodge ram 1500 hemi, had to contact the company cause the lights would blink and shut off when vehicle running. Got the new decoders for free from them and it worked great. Installation is easy, sometimes if it feels like you're trying too hard to get the bulb into the housing, check for an  old gasket leftover from old bulb. The connectors on the led lights were a little too tight to install and had to use pliers to connect them all the way until it clicked.

I got this steering wheel cover to replace an old one that had gotten cracked and damaged over the years. Compared to the old one, this new Mayco Bell one is super nice. It's much softer leather material and feels much more comfortable to hold. It has a great grip to it, and looks pretty nice.Putting it on the steering wheel definitely requires some effort and it wasn't easy. But once it's on, it stays in place tightly and works very well. It's a bit more expensive than similar products at Walmart, but it's definitely softer and nicer than my old Walmart one. We'll see if it stays that way after a few summers in the hot car.My only real complaint is how it was packaged. It was folded in half and stuffed in a plastic bag. It took a few days for the line where it was folded to not be visible anymore. Minor complaint, but it made the product feel a lot cheaper.For now, though, I like it and can definitely recommend it.

Nothing wrong with the I heart my lab decals, but this one is funnier for lab owners ( not too many dog breed names can make a pun ).  Decal is made from nice quality material.  Application is peel off part of the paper backing, and line up, and do the roll the paper from behind while pressing down on the decal.  Once on, peel up the opaque face and peel off so only the decal material is left on the glass.Few notes1. Make sure the surface is clean.  I used 91% Isopropyl alcohol and paper towel to clean the surface.  I do 2 passes with a new towel each time.2.  The roll the paper off the back is usually used with a squeegee of the decal onto the surface, Just press the decal down.  I don't know if it would shift if a squeegee method was used, why chance it.3. While I was starting to apply the bottom exposed 1/2" of decal, I dog eared the corner of the opaque facing material, to make removing it easier.4. Once the decal was on ( paper backing removed ) I pressed straight down on the decal with a 1x2 that I wrapped in soft side of 2 part Velcro.  The piece I used was about 1" long, so I was getting each part of the decal pressed down really well prior to removing the face.  Belt and suspender route is what this is.5. carefully peel the opaque face off the window, I had a 120* peel method for this ( the face was doubled back on itself when peeling ) so it was a peel, not a pull.  Go slow I had 1 part try to lift off, I pressed it back down with my finger and it stuck.6. Let the decal cure before trying to apply anything to the window.  I used a spray synthetic car wax and blotted it off.  Don't know if this will have a long term impact on the color or the decal itself, I am trying to make sure it does not have exposed edges.Sounds like a lot, but it took longer to type this, than it took to put it on.Great sticker, people smile when they see the sticker and then 2 black labs sticking their head out from the rear window of the rear seat of the truck.  Then again if you have labs sticking their head out of your car, you are used to compliments on them !

Stant 10510 Locking Fuel Cap. Got it in Feb. 2011 now it's Feb. 2012 and still works just fine. Lightly, I said lightly son!, lubricate the key trapdoor and inside the keyhole. Also take note of the direction of the key cut so you can quickly insert the key the first time then mark one side of the cap with a conspicous color, (silver Sharpie). Always insert the key cuts in the direction of the mark and then it's quicker to get the cap off, get fuel and go home. Otherwise it's which way does this damn key go in!

I received the Standard Survival Pro Window Breaker & Seatbelt Cutter Vehicle Escape Tool. Its a perfect size. The weight is balanced nicely. Here in Florida we have many canals along the roads. The perfect tool in case your in a situation where you can't roll down your window in an emergency. Also has the seat belt cutter (which sliced through paper effortlessly). Just make sure you put it somewhere in your car where children can't play with it, can seriously hurt someone.

I was a little hesitant about this purchase at first, but after an easy less than 15 minute install, I am in love with them. The packaging was surprisingly very smart and they gave me more alcohol wipe pads than I really needed.Make sure you get the right model for the back windows. I have an extended cab, so I have the smaller half Windows that just pop out. I was worried the back vents would hinder the back windows from popping open anymore, but there is a perfect amount of clearance and it wasn't an issue.Overall, very happy. Great packaging, easy installation, and perfect fit. Very clean fit.

I bought this exact set from an Audi dealer and the only difference is the VW/Audi-branded packaging, otherwise same plugs, same price. Replaced mine at 30,000 miles and it is running great so far. Although the mileage seemed kind of low for replacing new plugs but I don't like to leave them in my cars for more than 4 years, in my case it's been almost 5 years for this car so a small price to pay to keep my 2008 Audi A4 running in tip-top condition. The original plugs were Bosch F6KPP332S and these NGK's are the OEM plugs Audi is currently using for most if not all their late and newer model vehicles off the assembly line.

It is short, hence the added extenders (these should be a free option, rather than an extra expense. I can understand why they don't come standard, if people don't want them, they are a waste to ship and for the buyer to store, but they shouldn't be an extra $40 expense for people who would use them.That being said, it is pretty slick. The durability and the fact that a wind shield DOES come with it, is pretty nice! Install easy when placed on the correct rails, but versatile enough to customize to what you have.

It would have been 5 out of 5 if they included a small diagram of how to wire it. I spent a few hours wiring 2 of these switches to my 2 light bars. I'm not upset because I did learn a lot by wiring it myself. Now with that being said look at the pictures I posted, it will make your job 10000x times easier & save you time. I didn't see anyone else post what wires to connect, they just made things really complicated & so I posted them for anyone who buys the switches. I took pictures of what wire should go where to make it so easy anyone can do it. These will work if you have the Mictuning wire harness. I hope this helps you guys!(Note: these are 2 different harnesses as you can see by the color of wires, but they are both by Mictuning)

Item easy to install on my 2011 Patriot! Looks good! Make sure you use screws after drilling 4 holes to secure it! 3M striping is nice but I like the re-enforcement of the screws. I did not have to remove rubber strip on Jeep! I am very satisfied with this item! Make sure you register it for lifetime warranty!

Installs just like any other wheel rim tape.  It looks very nice, however, it is more gold than yellow.  Doesn't bother me too much, but would've been nice to match the bike more.  The picture is a bit misleading but still very happy.

Good kit, everything works. 3X the brightness of OEM 55W halogen? That's a LONG stretch. Same brightness maybe, see attached images. Light color is MUCH bluer than I thought 4300k would be. 1st pictures are HID on drivers side, OEM on passengers side. Later photos show HID in both housings. Drivers side is "greener" than passenger as shown in photos.Had some difficulty fitting in the OEM H7 spot on my CX-7, had to make a spacer. Entire light housing had to come out for installation. Mazda issue, not faulting SDX for that. Considering standard halogen bulbs are $20/pr or so, these HID's are well worth $35. Will be 100% satisfied if the HIDs shift closer to the same color over time.Another note: Ordered these with free shipping option. Ordered 12-7-14, Amazon sat on the order until 12-13-14 when they finally shipped. If you need these in less than a week, pay for the regular shipping.

  Replace bulbs much less often, bright, draws less power from your electrical systemI'm a big fan of LED technology, and I'm always happy to get the chance to play with a new product. The advantages of LED bulbs over incandescent is that the LED bulbs last hundreds of times longer than the older bulbs, while drawing one tenth of the power, and producing less waste heat.These bulbs are built for campers and trailers and such, and would not fit my car (totally my fault for not paying attention to the size). I was able to get a good look at how these would look in operation by running one off a 9-volt battery and comparing it to the bulb installed in my car (which runs off the 12-volt battery system). This LED bulb looks to be an equal to my current incandescent bulb, and would probably be brighter if I was running the normal 12-volt current through it. The bulb puts out a bright white light. I received a complimentary sample of this product, allowing me the opportunity to try it out and to share my honest opinion with you. I have received no compensation for this review, and offered no guarantee of its content.

Works great so far. Lights up everything like a flood light should.Mounting system was a little different than I expected as the nut that goes into the bottom of the light took a little more effort to get in than I feel like it should but once that was done, everything else was easy.Update: almost a year later and they are still going strong.  Zero issues up to this point and I check to make sure they still work and didn't have any condensation inside at least a few times a month.

I can cite numerous instances when one manufacturer makes products that get branded under different resellers names. I am very suspicious that this is an instance of that. I found the lock mounting hardware to be well made and sturdy. As for those complaining about buying a riveting tool, HARBOR FRIEGHT or pick up nuts and bolts. Though the product comes with pop rivets you don't have to use them!I have a Warn winch mounted in the bumper with a Maximus-3 mounting plate. As such I am not able to remove my grill without first removing the winch, a time consuming proposition. Consequently I did both methods to accomplish the install.I used the pop rivets to secure the mounting plate on the top (I like the look of this best, looks factory installed) and then since I can't move my grill far enough to access the mounting holes to rivet from the front I used nuts and bolts. Your hood will be just as secure using nuts and bolts as the rivets. It took a bit of fanaggling to to get a nuts on the bolts that go in from the front. You can't get an angle to get a wrench on the nut through the opening on top of the latch. (I used the nuts with nylon inserts and a washer on the bolt.)In order to get a wrench on the nuts inside the channel I had to tape electrical tape on the closed end of the wrench, push it down inside from the top, position the open end of wrench on nut and tighten the nut. Then get the wrench off the nut and use the electrical tape to get wrench repositioned for retrieval.Keying my ignition key worked as described. Love not having to have different keys.I had already purchased grill inserts so I am having to reorder the same model only with the opening to accommodate the lock. I cut my insert with a Dremel so I can access the lock for now. I did some searching for a grommet that would fit the opening and give it a finished look. I've given up and and reordering inserts with the lock opening.I agree with all those voicing opinion that a hood lock should be standard on Wranglers. There are too many valuable items under the hood even if you don't to any modifications starting with the battery and the hood itself (power hood on Hard Rock).

I installed this on my 1996 K2500 6.5 diesel.  It's great, especially for the price.  Only problem I encountered is that they are stingy with the included roll of tubing and on my truck it is stretched tight to reach from the intake plenum, through the firewall to the dash.  I like that the backlighting on this one is incandescent rather than LED so it can be dimmed.  I spliced the backlight wire into the dimmer wire that goes to the radio and it works well, not too bright at night like some aftermarket stuff.  The black face blends nicely with the dash, and the Bosch name looks cool even if it is made in China.

I bought these for my 96 Jeep Cherokee After lifting it 5" and i honestly can't be happier i have run everything from Fox 2.0 shocks to Old Man Emu i must say for the price you just cannot the beat the ride quality with these. Smooth and stable. I have put over 2,000 miles on my Cherokee and since then my lift has settled to 4.5" and these are holding up great and look brand new. I am a bilstein consumer for life why would you pay more? i had run bilstein 4600s when i was stock and i truly believe these 5100s ride better than stock by a long shot. If you need new shocks don't buy another trans american product ( Pro-comp,Rubicon Express) Even Quadratec are Chinese Specials It's all the same these are genuine made in Germany Tested and Proving.Side note if you are Replacing these on an XJ and live in the Salt Belt make sure to spray the top Shock bolts well with the penetrating oil of your choosing or you will be Practing drilling out and fishing a new bolt through the bolts old location.

Obviously it's white and a nicer color than a stock halogen bulb but at least on my car the distance covered by the light is the same.. I was expecting it to throw the light further.. As you can see from the pics the area covered is noticeably brighter than stock halogen. Didn't get a before pic of both halogen bulbs in. First pic has driver side halogen/passenger HID. Second both HID.

Best vortex generator you will find for the price. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is because we're the cut out of the antenna is located they cut a little bit bigger than they should I personally believe they should of cut it more to the size it actually is but that's the only flaw I could find other than that great product great shipping got to my house sooner than it should. Also great looking astetic to the car.

I have a 2006 BMW 325i that needed a Ignition Coil. The coil I removed was a Bosch 0221504463 but the replacement listed on Amazon (Bosh 0221504465) was indicated to be the correct replacement. When I received the part, it was gray in color (the original was black) and was stenciled on the part itself as a Bosch 0221504463 even though it came in a Bosch labeled box with the replacement number 0221504465. Very confusing I know. The bottom line is the electrical connector fit perfectly since it was the identical part number as the one removed. It would have been helpful to know the part I was getting was the same part number as the one removed except for the color. Perhaps the small difference in part number was for the color, who knows? In any event the part worked and the misfire I was experiencing disappeared. I do believe the description could have provided a note to why the number on the part was going to be different than the number printed on the box. This is the reason for four stars instead of 5.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bosch-0221504465-Ignition-Coil/dp/B004AG9ILC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bosch 0221504465 Ignition Coil</a>

Fit my 4x2 2.5L 00 XLT Ranger. The bolt that connects to the control arm is spindle section is a 15mm nut with a 17mm bolt. I used the original, so I'm not sure about the size it comes with. The two bolts that connect the control arm to the frame are 13/16, I used a deep socket to take the nut off.

As expected, top of the line equipment.  With 35 inch tires and a 3.5 inch lift, this lift is essential kit for my Wrangler JKU.  The extreme Hi Lift may also be used as a come along for vehicle recovery, which with no winch, is great piece of mind.  Buy the best, I've had others and there is no comparison.

Hey there! I ordered this product because it looked pretty awesome I got it installed today took only a few hrs and turned out pretty good lights worked great and are fairly bright. I had one struggle but got it worked out I wished two of the powercords that connect from the control box to the light were about 10 ft. long instead of six so I could mount them farther in the back of my chevy silverado 1500 truck but i ended up mouting them below the seat which worked out just fine and mouting the other two below the dash. Altogether pretty good product and I would recommend to about anyone unless they plan on mouting it in the back of their vehicle! Almost forgot shipped early too which I was glad!

Solid Warn quality -- love my Zeon 10k winch.  Installed on my new Smittybilt Gen2 XRC bumper on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler.  Caution:  You will have to use a metal grinder hand tool to grind away the 2 ears on the Jeep's bumper where the Smittybilt bumper attaches for the Winch to fit otherwise the Warn will sit on the winch plate but will not be able to move forward enough without hitting the ears to line up the holes on the winch plate with that of the winch.  Once done, the Warn fits perfectly and is a trouble free install probably about 60 minute install with grinding & installation etc. Looks fantastic -- on my Jeep.  Chose the tried and true steel rope over synthetic -- just being old fashioned :) Pics attached.

Simply the best undercarriage/suspension/fender liner product on the market, the pictures speak for themselves, does not leave a sticky Greesey film, I applied it with an applicator (I would recommend spraying it on a aplicator pad and not directly on the surface) and then drove down a dusty road a hour later and my truck was covered in dust but my undercarriage and fenderliners still looked spotless!

Sized as stated, real leather, great feel.  How good the end-result will look depends on how much effort and time you're willing to put into the installation.  Many reviewers mentioned that the holes were difficult to see or get the needle through, but I found that the holes were very easy to find from the tanned side.  Any issues are because I was in a hurry, and didn't want to take the time to correct any issues.  It can take a while. Seriously. Hours. I installed this cover to beat the feel of the deteriorating steering wheel, and one of those cheesy non-stitch covers; I'm very happy with the result.

It's not 100% a perfect match, but I think people are being too critical of it. Know what color it is when a rock dings my paint and knocks a chip off? White.

I bought these for my 2015 Dodge Ram 2500 crew cab truck.  Arrived very quickly.  (2 days).  The material is heavier than I thought it would be.  I have no problem with the general pleather material.  The front seat cover fit very well actually.  However, the back seat was not a good fit at all.  If you look at the photo of the front, you can see the pleather comes all the way to the edge of the seat.  On the back bench, it does not.  Also, and I should have thought about this, the pleather material is hot to sit on.  I'm in Las Vegas so this is an issue.So, my overall thoughts:  heavier than expected material  fit in front good  fit on back bench seat not good  I like the color, it makes my drab gray interior a little more funNot a good fit for me. If the rear bench would have fit, I would have kept them but I'm returning them.

This is a great mod for the stang. I am a mechanic, took me about 45 minutes to install. Kit really doesn't come with insructions, but that didn't bother me. Sounds freaking awesome, get that deep throaty noise of an old 4 barrel carb kicking in.. At mid to mid to wide open throttle the intake noise is louder than the stock exhaust. Filter is quite raspy at wide open throttle to but I love it. Does help the mid range throttle response too, say 30-60% throttle at 30 mph has a bit more pep. Didn't gain any mpg but that's probably because I can't stop goosing it just fyi hear the intake. If your reading this, but the darn thing already. I have 2 friends with stangs and they love this too.

The scan tool works as advertised. It connects to the vehicle easily and the tool is easy to operate. The only problem I have with the unit so far is the USB cable that came with the unit, the mini end that goes to the tool does not go far enough in to stay connected. I had to dig out another cable I had here that had a mini end that was a few millimeters longer and it works great. The cable on the left, in the picture, is a cable that I had at the house and the one on the right was the one that came with the product. You can see a slight length difference. Its just enough to keep the cable from completely connecting.

I used the 1.8mm to spray primer and it did very well then the 1.4 mm to spray the base coat nd did great as well , didn't use the 1.0mm yet I think it will hold up good too!

Not perfect but close enough for fender flares. Don't think I'd attempt a door or something big with this.

Bought and installed with ACDelco  advantage discs . Braking sound after 1000 mile better but  WoWoWo sound still persist during braking from 60m/h and up. I am going to replace them.Edited. After 3000 miles took them off  together with ACDelco rotors because of sound and plus vibration. It is not a professional braKe pads or rotors, it is low quality product. Don't recommend ACDelco!

I bought a similar one and used it yesterday. No matter how I tightened it the pad/chain/plastic keeps slipping/moving from its original position. I was afraid its going to come off. I keep stopping and adjusting it. FYI

Installed 6/25/2015. They look good. Fit was perfect, a simple plug and play. These were the best switchbacks I've tried. The white is very bright and has a clean crisp with color without any hint of blue. They actually add to the lighting power of my headlights. The amber is, well amber. My truck requires four bulbs in the front and the colors were identical. They did require load resisters, (remember, one resister per bulb). The functions are flawless.The reason for the four stars was due to the amber being not as bright as the white. Maybe 30% dimmer. FYI: I have not contacted the vendor due to the fact that they all work and the intensities are exactly the same with the four bulbs. I do like them. [Search You Tube for "2011 SILVERADO JDM ASTAR LED" to see how they look in use]Today, they have been in my truck for approximately six weeks. I will write a follow up when they fail and hopefully won't be for a couple of years. The pictures I've included were the best my "Cheapo Deluxe" camera could do

*** NOT A PAID REVIEW ***Bottom Line:  Works GreatThis is a review of the TRICO wiper blade.  Sadly its been 7 years since I replaced my wiper blades for my infiniti and so it had to be done.  The blade arrived within 2-3 days, typical for prime members, and they were as described in the ad.  Upon inspection, it was exactly as described in the ad as well as other reviewer comments.  The form factor was nearly identical to the one I was replacing so that was a relief.  Installation was a little tricky because I had to completely remove the wiper arm but after about five minutes it was done.  Timing couldn't have worked out any better since weve been getting rain like crazy in CA and its nice to have a functional wiper blade...even if its just for the rear window.  Anyway, if you're looking for a nice replacement to your OEM blade, you won't go wrong with this model and brand.Cons:- cant think of anyPros:- well made- great fit- fairly easy install

Works like a champ!  Plugged it in, it asked the phone for a bluetooth pin number in order to pair ("1234"), started the Torque app., it connected, works perfectly.If you don't get proper readings in the Torque app., your car probably doesn't have a sensor for that particular function (example from pic:  My car doesn't have a Air Temp sensor).  Works with '99 Mazda MX-5 Miata.

These brackets have a beautiful crinkle finish black paint that looks like it was baked on. They arrived unblemished because they were well protected in the box. They screwed in perfectly into the factory holes, with no modifications needed. I couldn't figure out how to run the wires without it looking like a nightmare. Finally I realized that the outer curve of the bracket (that wraps around the A pillar) is actually two angles; it's not a perfect curve like the car, and in the crevice of the outermost angle, you can fit two wires, but only if you take the insulation off the outside of the two wires. I don't mean run bare wires. What I mean is that the black rubber outer sleeve has to be taken off and just the red and the black insulated wires run in the corner of the bracket. What I had to do was actually cut an eighth-inch slice or channel through the foam padding that was supplied to go between the bottom half of the bracket and the car. So I cut the channel and ran the wires in the corner there, then did a hard left turn and went between the quarter panel and the A pillar beneath the hinge, and down into the wiper sill, then into the engine compartment. Friend of mine who is an accomplished customizer of cars remarked that "it looks factory."  Indeed. Five stars, even though it cost as much as the light barAnd by the way, the light I put on the Jeep was a 50 inch light bar and these brackets fit perfectly. I got the impression that they could be easily modified for 52 inch light. The only stone I can throw at these brackets is that I had to go and buy stainless steel bolts, because I didn't want any rust happening. But that was my choice.

This is a great nwt for the price. Instead of using it as a tailgate replacement, I use it as a bed separator (no need for a big 2x4 now). I have it 20" back from the tailgate and use it to keep my groceries and tools from sliding forward. The quick release hooks that are sold separately are a real time saver.

I've never worked with Bondo before in my life. I decided to fix a fender on my Porsche that had some minor damage. I got quoted a minimum of $1750 to fix a simple ding on a fender. One Autobody shop quoted $3800. Because it is a modified Porsche I must get "noob" prices.I watched a couple Youtube videos, which took about a whole 25 minutes, then spent another 2-3 hours mining away in "Bondo" talk on Reddit..after a quick afternoon ...I learned the "difficult" job and fixed the damage perfectly. Bondo is amazingly strong and is very easy to work with.The mixing ratio seemed vague so I went with 8 drops per 3-4 grams, on wax paper on top of a scale. Since I was in the garage with the door closed and it was late, I figured I could do this in my underwear since the garage was hot (it's summer). Working with Bondo produces a strong smell, so I decided to wear a filter/rebreather mask as well. My wife walks in to check on me as I am in my underwear, with a gas mask, using a scale to measure some drops on some gooey glop on wax paper at 2am. She said, "What are you...Walter White?".Mixed Bondo on wax paper, use "folding" action to mix it.Used these Spreaders, mostly the large one&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dynatron-358-Spreader/dp/B0015DMGD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dynatron 358 Spreader</a>Spread it around to make it flat as possible, very akin to spreading icing on a cake. The bondo gets hard and tacky fairly quickly, within 1-2 minutes, so don't dawdle.Let it dry. Don't rush it. I let it dry 24 hours.I chose to wet sand it, even though nowhere recommended it...or said not to. I chose to do this to keep the dust down. It worked perfectly. I used 400, then 600 grit and hand sanded it. I went up to 1200 grit and thought it was smooth enough. This took me 3.5 hours because I am meticulous.At this point I was done. You may choose to paint your own car at this point. I am not that brave with my Porsche.Dropped it off at an Autobody shop and they charged a very fair price to paint the fender.10/10 would do it again.

Until materials change dramatically, a DOT approved helmet is always going to give you a certain amount of the dreaded "mushroom head".  This is due to DOT's "cushioning" requirements.  Hitting your head on the pavement isn't just a matter of your helmet keeping your head from cracking open - your head is still sloshing around in it and the padding keeps the helmet from simply transferring that sudden shock from it's plastic surface to your calcium based skull.  Carbon fiber novelty helmets are extremely low profile and are made from the same exterior stuff that your DOT approved brain bucket is - it's just got a lot less padding.  That said, the differences are often bemoaned but seldom compared.  I've tried to do just that with the picture I've attached comparing the Skid Lid Original Solid Helmet with an extremely well reviewed (but not sold on Amazon) carbon-fiber helmet.  If you take a look at the two, the difference, in my humble opinion, is minimal.  Certainly so little that the choice to have the added protection of a DOT approved helmet shouldn't be hard to make.  Especially if the unthinkable happens and you find yourself going down the hard way.I'm a survivor of a extremely serious motorcycle accident and I credit my relative lack of extreme injury to my wearing a helmet.  You owe it to your loved ones to reasonably gear yourself with protective equipment you feel comfortable with.  I've worn the carbon fiber helmet and loved it.  There's been other times I was glad to have my bulkier Skid Lid on.  I also have a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Scorpion-EXO-1100-Full-Face-Helmet/dp/B00CPP05JY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Scorpion EXO-1100 Full Face Helmet</a>&nbsp;that I've taken to wearing on the rare occasion I have to face my So Cal commute during the Rush-Hour Rodeo.  Wear whatever makes you feel safe; the choice of what that is, is up to you.

I've owned this rack for over a year now with 4 different bikes it's carried. For the price, it's a good deal for a platform setup but if your bike is worth over a grand look elsewhere. I had no problems with this rack up until yesterday. The pin that holds the bar up that clamps down on the top tube came loose and popped out causing it to loose hold of the bike. Luckily the curve of the holder kept my $6500 bike in place long enough for me to pull over before it took a spill on the highway...  This was the first time the pin has ever came out on me. The pins do tend to move around while driving but they've never rotated all the way up so the pin could slide out of the valley used to "lock" the pin in place.  I think Curt should really think about changing the design of their way to easily adjust the rack. I'd recommend to use a locking pin like the rest of the rack has on it so nothing can wiggle out anymore. Luckily today was Veloswap in Denver so I picked up a nice Rocky Mount platform rack to replace this one.

Put these on a 2006 Hyundai Sonata with new Centric rotors and after bleeding the lines the pedal is now solid again.  The car stops much quicker than before and there's no brake noise.  These come with a small packet of brake grease that was enough for all 4 pads.  Would recommend and buy again.

Very impressed with these lights.  They look great, they're easy to install, and extremely bright.  I installed them on my 2017 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited.  A few pointers when it comes to installation:  you might find it challenging locating a spot to mount the relay, which needs to be within 16" of the battery.  I mounted mine on the left side of the engine compartment right next to the battery... there's a metal plate there with an existing hole.  Next, be sure to use plenty of zip ties to keep the wiring out of the way of anything hot.  I ran mine along the back and outer edge of the engine compartment... there's plenty of wire.  Finally, if you decide to mount the switch to a blank spot on your dash instead of using the supplied mounting plate (I mounted mine on the left side of the steering wheel), be sure to mount the switch to the desired location BEFORE attaching the wires.  You won't be able to squeeze the plastic mounting nut up and around the wiring behind the switch if you don't.  Good luck and happy wheeling!

This trail box is a little on the small side, but it gets the job done for what we need. My wife uses it to store small tools and such (hammer, pliers, knife, etc...) for work around our small farm. The locking mechanism has some wiggle room, so it rattles loudly when the engine is running on the ATV...that's annoying. Other than that, it's great for what we need.

Great product to use. I was a bit skeptical because I didn't know how much of a difference it would make. I bought both this and the Back-to-Black Trim Restorer and essentially, this product deeply cleans my trim and the Restorer is kind of like a wax? When I used this cleaner I could see scratch marks on my trim and then I put the Restorer on it and left that on for a few mins to let it penetrate the trim and then wipe it off and it looks brand new.

These fit just right on my 2003 Passat wagon. They are made as expected, not the highest quality I've ever seen, but for the price I can't complain at all. When I first mounted them, there was quite a bit of whistling above 20mph. But then I put on he rubber strips under the bars and the whistling is all but gone now. They hold my bike racks very well and I look forward to all the stuff I can carry up there now

Sound quality is good but the installation quality is poor I didn't expect it to be this way. the connection ring is not perfect for removal in the future, also the hooks are not plug and play; I had to bend the hooks little bit to fit it properly and the tips are very close to the number plate.

I got this to potentially replace RIG grease for use in protecting Firearm barrels from rust which is a big problem in the deep south.Seems to be top notch for preventing rust so far.  I did an unscientific test with this, RIG grease, and Hornady One-shot during a cold raining December.  It has been 5 days in the rain, Hornady One-Shot which has ACE'd other online tests failed at day 2. Only the RIG grease and WD-40 Specialist LTCI are preventing rust (See photo).  Looks like the WD-40 LTCI might be starting to fail but... for being on raw iron almost submerged in water thats very impressive.  RIG grease has absolutely not one spec of rust on it.People have commented it gets sticky.  I do not see this at all, it ends up more like a common grease type substance.Two problems: #1, the can is way overcharged on propellant, its impossible to dispense this except in an explosive manner so it gets everywhere and way too much.  And #2, its way overpriced to me.  The can is so much smaller than all the other specialist products, its almost a joke how small it is for how much they charge.  Considering a big jar of RIG grease is about the same price...it will be hard to make me switch.

Looks great, seems to work just as well as the factory one. Reception might be a little less, but it's hard to tell as reception is spotty around my house across multiple vehicles anyway. Factory one was way too long, kept hitting trees branches along the road. The one on my previous truck bent, so I didn't want that happening on the new one. I just painted the tip to make it more visible and customize it a bit.

Lights arrived extremely quick.  Build quality seems solid.  Removable rubber backing.  Red (power) & white (ground) leads are about 3.5" in length - very thin gauge.  Works perfect for this 4runner mod. in the grill.  You can use zip ties and attach by the holes in the light or fab up a bracket out of plastic and use screws to install the light like I did.

The red bulbs in the photo are not Putco plasma bulbs. Putco plasma bulbs are silver with yellow COB (chip on board) LED's. Genuine Putco bulbs are silver, just like the photo, and should match what is on the box.

When they say "Super Jumbo," they really mean it! These shades are way bigger than necessary for both my Land Rover and Acura MDX, but they absolutely do work well to keep the heat out of the car. If you're driving a monster truck or a delivery van, these might be the perfect size!The oversize height of the shade is a benefit of sorts---you can tuck the shade under the edge of the visor without actually lowering the visor itself (my husband swears that lowering the visor in blazing sun will deform/melt the safety warning stickers). Side-to-side, there is a huge overlap so I guess you're getting double heat protection for half the windshield.One star off because these are really cumbersome to refold for storage, just because of the size. Your passenger might complain about you hitting them in the face when you twist them to pack them up! After I fold and secure with the strap, I wedge these between the passenger seat and the console for storage.

Mount holes are not in alignment, Light bar is great nice and bright but unfortunately with out having to modify the mount it is useless, if you purchase plan on having to modify the mount holes to align with the lower windshield mount location.

It's tough to take a picture that does these lights justice. They are really bright. I installed them today about an inch under my awning. I got the 16-foot kit which comes with four 4-foot plastic channels. It was really easy to install. I drilled a small hole through the side of my RV where the wires would enter a cabinet that had a power source inside. I tapped into that, installed a switch and everything works great. I have not extended the awning yet but even with it retracted and not reflecting the light downward it is very bright. The photo is the best I have right now. Don't judge- my old Allegro is parked under a lot of oak trees that make it look pretty dirty this time of year.

Just used 7 cans to spray the majority underbody of my crew cab truck. I have 1 can in reserve to hit spots as I seen them during fluid changes. Guessing 10 cans could have done the entire underbody.I am glad the cans come in 16oz because you will whip through one in no time.I wore gloves but would recommend an old hat and possibly a face shield..seriously once this stuff gets on your skin you have to scrub like heck to get it off.It does dry quickly to a nice flat finish, appears quite durable. I will find out this winter when its exposed to the salt, snow, slush and ice of an Iowa winter. Truck is too big for my garage so I cant wait to see how it does being outside 24/7.I will report back this winter either here, or in the comments.

I've had these snow cables for about 7 years, and this weekend was the first time I actually needed to use them. Thankfully I practiced putting them on my 2008 Honda Odyssey in my driveway BEFORE we went on our trip to the Sierras. As you can see by the pictures that I uploaded, it started to snow moderately which left the road white and icy. These cables were straight forward to mount, and they performed exceptionally in road conditions that saw 4x4's with full sets of chains. The hardest part about properly mounting the cables was attaching the rubber tensioner, which required a bit of muscle to get all 6 hooks connected. No big deal if you're strong or you workout, but could be very tough if you have a weaker than normal grip. Maximum speed was 30mph with the cables mounted, which was much faster than comparable vehicles with conventional chains. My buddy that manages a Honda parts department at the dealer said these SCC's are the best available chains/cables for our van, and I have to agree. I rate these SCC cables 5 stars for their perfect fit, build quality and straightforward mounting.FYI: I found the van performed much better with the VSA (traction control) turned off.

I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest reviewLED for a car headlight, how cool is that.  I used to use those so called blue headlight for HID looks but stay within budget. But the problem with those light bulb are just tinted with blue color.  Ampper LED light are showing white color, as promising 6k color temperature.  It is very easy installation, just like changing a bulb without any other tools.  Took me about 10min to get it right.  (if the light does not turn on, just flip the power plug opposite way, it has to do with power polarity)  After 10 min of plug - n - play,  I have successfully mod my headlight to LED...

I have been running this in my E36 BMW M3 for 5 years. I typically do oil changes every 5,000 miles, but I know of people who run it for 8,000. I actually called the oil manufacture to find out which oil was recommended for my car. I had the west coat regional sales rep reach out to me and explained that this specific oil is highly recommended for BMW M cars. It's fully synthetic oil, so you don't need to worry about if it's a hybrid.For reference, my BMW M3 has 225,000 miles. The previous owner of my car use LiquiMoly and I then switched to this formula. My car has had no motor repairs done.

Very easy install on my 2017 F150 SuperCrew. It literally took me 20 minutes from start to finish, and I'm the furthest person from being mechanically inclined. This time even included reading the straightforward instructions. Both sides were installed easily with the same amount of effort. All 4 holes lined up perfectly on each liner.These make my truck have a more finished look. The exposed frame above the rear wheels really bothered me; this fixed that. My only complaint is  that one of the liners is wavy along the edge making it stick out when viewing from the front. If not for that, this would be 5 stars.

DOES NOT FIT 2009 GMC SIERRA 1500 EXT CAB!  pigtail for electrical connection too short to relocate as per instructions and tech support (Dorman Products) [SEE PHOTO] ; suppose to relocate behind cab ON truck bed but the pigtail is about 6 to 8 inches too short for that; unless you wish to just put it anywhere (which was suggested by tech support) you can but I should not need to modify the fit just to use these parts; Returned.

So far so good the only complaint I have is I wish it came in matte black because with glossy black every little fingerprint shows with this thing but that is fine, it is a comfortable fit large worked well for me and I am a 5 ft 11 male 185 lb, the tense is great it's the perfect amount of tint now I don't have to wear sunglasses under my helmet when it's sunny out and you can even actually see even writing in the dark with this tinted visor as well, how that seems to be of pretty good quality, time will tell if the color will start feeding or not but all in all it is a great product for the price.  Oh and when you are wearing this helmet be prepared for everybody to look at you because this helmet alone turns heads and you look badass with it on.

If I could give it zero stars I would, the craftsmanship that went in to the light is horrible. I would return the light but it's not even worth the time.... Just keep in mind you get what you pay for!CONS:O-rings on all six side screws are out of place and ripped, has chips in the paintPROS:solid metal structure, other than that there are none!!

Great Idea... Just received and trying to figure out how to hook it on ..Pros -Straps are like seat belt material study n strong ..they come rolled up and sewn on the end. Rubber appears to be sturdyCons -Manufactor/Site needs to identify vehicles this will fit properly. Its obvious some vehicles it fits better then others.I have a 2009 Nissan Cube and it has a rear door and a low bumper with the tag in lower bumperIt also has rear back up sensors and the way this hangs it blocks 4 of the sensors.The item is shipped FOLDED IN HALF ! Not a good idea for rubberThis crease will not come out of it and makes it hang with a buckle in it once on the bumperI laid it out flat as soon as I opened it and over night but still crease will not come out ..Needs to be shipped flat may cost more but would take care of this issue.There are no pictures of vehicles that have the area cut out of bumper for license plate .The design inside trunk of my car is deep and no carpeting is available to attach it tooI do have 2 latch like things in rear that I was able to attach it too but I had to cut the stitching in the end of the belt to be able to fit it through the latch. Then Im left with all this extra strap flaming around ...I think Ill have to put a snap on it to make it stay onThey do provide you with 2 small pieces of velcrove to stick to inside of vehicle However anyone pulling hard on the strap will pull it off and can walk with the whole thing ..Hard to center in bumper as the latches are not set at the same width the straps are located on the bumper bullyNext I had to cut out the center rubber for the license plate ..There are no directions on how to best do this other then to use sharp razor blade ..I found that using a craft knife or carpet knife vs trying to hols a razor blade to cut through the thick rubber. It was easier when I turned bumper bully right side up facing me and then cut on paper ...no good needs wood behind it so that when you press down in to rubber you get clean cut. As a result the first side I cut doesn't look so good..Drives me nuts ..Would have preferred manufacture send it precut would look betterIt really takes some craftiness to figure out how to hook it on so it will stay on ...

Easy to use If you have some experience with painting and spray guns. If not proceed with some care and follow the directions. Prep is the key. I pressure washed the truck bed first and made sure everything was sanded and scuffed (no shiny spots). I primed any bare metal with #8 Primer. Masked off everything, blew the bed out with air and wiped everything down with lacquer thinner. I mixed only one liter at a time and sprayed at 60 psi with the supplied gun and an 8-gal compressor spraying at about 18 inches away 90 degrees to the surface as much as possible. It took three cans (liters). Im saving the 4th for the tailgate (which I took off) and another small project to do later. Some things to consider: Safety first: Wear a respirator/mask; No Open Flame; Wear a hat and long sleeves. If its hot, Do Not drip sweat. Wipe it up dry before you start. Take care the bottom of the can or hose does not drag in your wet work as you get those tight spots. All in all the material is very forgiving to irregularities. There was not a lot of overspray so you don't need to drop cloth the whole garage. I like the outcome and will update later to see how it holds up.

I used this on my S2000 along with new brakes, slotted rotors and stainless lines.  Great product!!!!!!!!  It is now a year later and no peeling or chipping. I painted the calipers off the car. I used 2 separate kits (fronts and rears).  Prep is key. I used a can of brake clean with each caliper with a small wire brush that looked like a toothbrush getting in all the nooks and cranny's.  After that was clean and dry I used a dry paint brush to dust off the calipers again until there was no more brake dust. I had a nice set up on a bench with cardboard and all my parts laid out. Oh and don't forget the brush is really crappy.  I went to a craft store and got a bunch of tiny brushes for $5 that I could toss after I was done. You have to have those to do a nice job. I would also recommend about a  12" piece of 2x4 or similar you can rest the caliper on. I did paint the insides but you really want to get that first and rest the caliper on the 2x4 on its end to get a nice finish on the outside and let it dry.Take your time and don't rush it. You will get the results you want if you put in the time

Just put this oil in my ZX-12 and the bike loves it. Shifting has become much smoother and the valves aren't as noisy. As others have said, this is the best oil you can get unless you're an actual GP racer and need the motul 300. Ester based oils are the way to go.Stuff smells awesome too!

Best wheel cleaner for plastidip I've found that also doesn't stain my StopTech rotors.  I have white plastidip wheels and the brake dust was too much work to remove every week.

If you need an insert just stop looking and buy this one.  Installation takes less than 30 minutes and the results look as good as anything else your going to look at.  I didn't use zip ties the provided hardware works just fine if you just think about what you're doing. Install it with the idea that the spring tension will hold the grill against the fascia. So install it so that pressure will be exerted against the grill using the supports.And as far as people getting upset that the screw on the top causes the front grill to bow up where it rests against the plastic liner... you and your mechanic will be the only people on the planet to notice the 1/6 of an inch flex bulge that you can ONLY see when the hood is open.

This worked perfectly for converting my dirt bike to a street legal "motorcycle." As others have said, this will blink/click a few times after you shut off the blinker. Not an issue for me as I can't hear it while I'm on my bike, but I could see how it might be annoying in other applications.I ended up using&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dorman-84734-2-Wire-Flasher-Socket/dp/B002ET0HJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dorman 84734 2-Wire Flasher Socket</a>&nbsp;to plug it into, although you could solder or use a couple of female wire connectors to get the job done in a pinch. My only complaint is that it doesn't seem to have a good way to mount it to anything...I didn't want it to be out dangling in the wind so I used an old throttle grip and a hose clamp to hold it in place.

To be very honest, I'm not a big fan of drilling holes in a car that would be there FOREVER!However if you measure a thousand times and try to keep it symmetrical it is easy to install...*installation*1. Take bumper off (get access behind the fenders)2. MEASURE MEASURE MEASURE! once measured put down masking tape and place your measurements3. Drill a hole through your masking tape using a drill bit that seems to be the size of hex nut provided in the package4. paint the hole with nail polish or a paint whatever reduce that rust yo5. put washer behind fender, get the fastener & screw, and put togetherThis is what took forever 6. place the nut on the hex nut behind the fender... use a 10mm wrench to hold in place and find a hex screw and tighten7. then put bands on after use did the following 4xthat's it. It would have taken me 30 mins tops but I didn't know how to tighten the blooming thing lmao (i'm a little slow)here's some pics

UPDATE SECOND PARAGRAPHThis is my day one review. Shipping packaging was well done and protected product well. I was happy to find it came with a storage bag for when you are not using it. It fits my 2017 Sierra with the factory spray in bed liner perfectly and took about ten minutes to install. I did not use any of the weather stripping that came with it as it fits great without it. Its only about 17 degrees and I expect the material to flatten out when it warms up a bit. I will update my thoughts when spring hits and it has had some miles put on it.Ok so almost four months in and 6500 miles with weather ranging from about 02-65f. Still working great and looking great as well. Keeps everything dry and out of sight. Last three photos are taken after months of use.

I have a 2015 Kia Optima GI.  These fit perfectly without the foam pad that is included. It is one slot... about 3" deep from front to back - meaning one depth... the photo is a bit misleading the way it is presented with things standing straight up and on their sides.  My seat moves back and forth as I get out and I manually moved the seat in and out several times to see if the pocket would become dislodged... it did not at all.  It easily moved with the seat.  It will be nice to have a place to put my cell phone that doesn't block controls and will be easy to find.  It is nice because it does not collapse when put into place.  It is easy to remove and dump out dust, crumbs or anything that might have "dropped" in.  I never hesitate to update my reviews if new info would be helpful... Further, I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.  This is a VERIFIED, full price, independent purchase.

Decent quality and very fast shipping. The double sided tape is a bit thicker than normal adhesive used for emblems and decals, but doesnt look bad. Has held up through rain a couple times but have yet to see it carwashes will tear them off. Just make sure to thoroughly clean the surface area prior to applying.

This kit is junk. Made of soft metal. Pulled the threads right out the first time trying to install the pull back on a brand new pump. In the pictures you can see it pulled the threads off of the shank and off of the large nut that rides on the provided bearing. Just save yourself the money and get the OEM branded pulley remover/installer.

I just bought these for our 2016 (new gen) Pilot.  Second row is a great fit.  Third row requires some trimming but for occasional use does the job and I'm not going to be picky considering the strange layout. The front mats are far too small for this SUV for the heavy snow we receive up North, but even the expensive Weathertech Universals are too small.  Four stars considering the price and quality.  I will likely order the Honda specific mats from Honda or Weathertech to handle repeated pooling of snowmelt.

You get what you pay for.  There is a gap big enough to stick my finger in where the mat curves around the bumper by the license plate lights.  Other than that it looks pretty good.  If you have OCD I would recommend getting something different.  If you don't really care about your truck and just want to replace a bumper that was really messed up then this is pretty good.

Really handy tray. It doesn't snugly hold the wrenches. But definitely helps save space. I will be ordering a second one for my other wrenches. It does have an odd amount of spots and the sticker layout isn't how I would like it, but those are just little details that really don't matter.

I installed these in the interior of my 2008 Jeep Wrangler to add additional lighting.  They work great and do a very good job considering their size.  They put out a nice white light.  The wiring came loose on a couple of them and their could have been some type of waterproofer on the interior, but I squirted a little silicone inside each light to help hold the wires in place and also provide more support to the very small gauge wires.  I would suggest inserting the silicone, letting it dry, and then installing the lights.I installed four in the front of the sound bar, two in the rear of the sound bar, and four in the rear cargo area...as shown in the attached pictures...and tied them in to the existing cargo lights.  They come on when the door opens and go off shortly after it is closed.  All in all I am very please with this product.

Needed just a few inches of lift so I could comfortably reach the oil drain bolt. Ramps seem a little narrower than expected but wide enough for the 245mm wide tires on the WRX. Although they are made in China, they seem to be pretty sturdy. There is a small bump stop at the end of the ramps but it's best to get a friend watch for you.

7/2/18 Update:  Still using these with my 2013 WRX.  I still use a backup 2-ton jack with it and/or have two floor jack as a backup in case any of them fail.  Sounds ridiculous right?  Not really considering a guy I know just had a fractured skull after his jack stand from another brand failed and escaped death.  I hate going under my car but if I am, I just make sure I'm well prepared.  Not worth trying to rush doing anything under the car either.  It's holding up well as I'm doing an oil change ever few months so I'd say my use is on the light side.  No rust (kept in a shed) so far.  So close to two years it's been holding up great!I've using a cheap $50 floor jack I bought here with Torin 3 Ton jack stands but realized quickly it's not enough to really get under my '13 Subaru WRX and forget trying to use the Lisle creeper (also bought here) with it so decided to go with the 6 Ton and glad I did.  It's not heavy at all and the welds and construction looks great (better than my Torin 3 Ton jack stands honestly).  The price was also better than Torin.  Came in packaged nicely.These jack stands also have a bigger footprint which feels safer and of course being able to lift my car nearly 24" with my Sunnex 6602LP gave me plenty of space to work under the car comfortably.  The combo was a good choice since I can lift my g/f's Highlander if I ever need to work on her car.  I guess you can never have enough jack stands.  I usually use my jack stands and the floor jack as a backup along with my spare steel ramps shoved on the side of the car just in case if any of them fail.  Better to be safe than sorry!Pictured is my 6 Ton & the 3 Ton jack stands.  I'll probably get another pair of 6 Ton down the road.

This Heavy Duty Diamond Plate cargo trunk mat by Zento Deals is perfect for any car or truck.  Its extremely heavy duty and perfect for placing almost anything on it with out it sliding around.  It keeps your original truck carpet in good shape, especially when throwing tools or parts in the truck.  Its very easy to cut down, but it fit in my acura TL without even having to do so.  I have a expensive oem plastic truck liner and this by far is much better, mainly its softer and easier to remove.This item was shipped extremely fast and am very happy with my purchase.  I received this item at a promotional discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

Fairly straight forward replacement once I figured how the groove in the pads mated with the carrier. The carrier accepts the braking force, not the caliper. The pads were made in India, that's different.The new pads had copper threads in the matrix, in a ceramic pad??? Did a search, to be expected. Okay :)The braking performance was excellent after the new pads and rear brake adjustment.Some tips:- Put a container under the master cylinder, then use a C-clamp to compress the caliper piston.- If you're replacing the front pads, then for sure your rear brake shoes are out of adjustment, may be worn too. Remove the drum and turn the star wheel until the drum just fits. Will make a huge difference in the brake pedal feel.

I'm one of those guys that hates aftermarket parts of any kind on my vehicle. I have an American vehicle and I do not want anything foreign on it. Well when I started realizing how expensive an OEM bumper,  bumper cushion,  valance, fog light and all the other front end parts for a Tahoe after an accident would cost I went for this option. Let me say,  it's not as heavy as the original but you would only know that if you held the original bumper in hand the three aftermarket in the other. Also,  you cannot tell a difference once it is mounted. The only person that will know you have an aftermarket bumper is you!! IT DOES COME WITH THE THREE MOUNTS TOO!  A center bracket,  then two side ones.  Now the mounts suck!!!!!!  and here's why....There is a nut that is welded into the bracket that you put a bolt through when you go to moubt the bracket onto the new bumper. It is barely welded into the bracket. So,  if you plan on using an impact drill to draw your bolts down onto the bracket then plan on this bolt breaking off of the mount. It's not a bug deal if it does tho,  you just hold the bolt with an additional ratchet from underneath and then tighten your bolt down with the drill. Still,  slightly annoying tho,  because they could of just welded the bolt on a little better. So for this,  I deduct one star. The color also looks identical to the original. Overall,  I'm pleased

So... great idea that has a higher than should be price tag ( check out Ali Express for a very competitive product at $35) and has been modified over its lifecycle to work, without retooling. My advice to the manufacturer is to update the product to remove the additional hole in the front, and add installation instructions that all seem to complain about for most products that are shipping from China. The spiderballs are clever renaming of an existing bungie product that exists all over the internet and I think Home Depot. I bought this from my local and trusted 4x4 location - Morris 4x4 - absolutely love the color options as lighter is better here in the deep deep south. There are discounts offered in the jeep forums where there are a ton of comments related to installation and instructions. It would take very little money to make this a higher quality sale - I recommend SWS spend that money on exactly that.. My sequence of photos will offer more guidance than their lack of instructions or the one video you can find

This is a good way to move your plate in states that require it to stay horizontal. The LED lights are fairly bright and the look of the holder is very classic. You will need the Kuryakyn mounting clamp to mount this, there are a few choices depending where you want to affix the plate holder.

Similar to my Harley Daymaker LED light, they have a terrific cut-off point to truly act as a fog light (dispersing low and wide).  I'll have to adjust/angle them to be even more effective but they're great out of the box.  (Adjustment is easy with an allen-wrench.)  When installed, they sit at the same depth as the OEM fog lights.Be aware - they're fog lights....not crazy-bright DRLs that will blind/alert other drivers to your presence.  Get an HID kit for that, BUT, if you're looking for a true "fog light" setup, these are definitely worth while!Install on a '15 Jeep Wrangler was a little more of a pain, since I had to remove the bumper (4 bolts, not bad, just didn't expect) but it's totally worth it.  For this vehicle, I'd HIGHLY recommend getting the wiring adapter to truly make it plug and plug (no splicing or other stuff) - search "H16 HID adapter 5202" on Amazon.Attached pics - You can see the "top/bottom cutoff" points with the yellowish line.  This is a great on/off point for the fog lights that doesn't let the light disperse too far up/down.  They're much brighter in person, as it's hard to get the camera to capture what "you" really see.

I use these on my Ariens Compact 24 Snow Thrower.  Wow!  Talk about increasing sight while throwing snow, this set does the job and are tough enough to take the weather, dampness and vibration levels.  The Ariens Compact 24 Snow Thrower is a wonderful unit, but it was lacking in the amount of light with its built in headlight.  I modified my unit to take the MTD heated hand grips and the Auxbeam LED Work Lights.  To use on the thrower the 12 volt A/C output from the engine has to be changed to D/C current to power the LED Cree lights.  To do this I installed a full bridge rectifier to supply the needed D/C current.  They work great!  They supply daylight type conditions on the darkest of winter nights.  It allows me to safely see my way while snow clearing at night.ProsExtremely strong durable caseAll hardware needed for mounting suppliedNice heavy wireVery bright outputNice fan light beam - covers large areaConsI couldn't find anyAll in all this is a wonderful light set that are very bright.  They work great on my snow thrower.

I was actually surprised at how well these were made. They are tough and fit the application I needed them for (redoing oil cooler lines). Hose clamps and worm gear clamps can work, but I have since ordered some AN fittings to complete the setup properly. I'd buy these again in a heartbeat (and probably will in the near future).

I love this rack!I was originally planning on getting a 1up, but that thing is just to ugly for my taste.The kuat is Sooo much nicer of a rack. and being able to convert the receiver hitch size is a HUGE plus. The hitch on my car is only 1.24" and the hitch on my other car is 2", so being able to convert this rack with a simple screw on adapter is awesome.I will admit, paying this much money for a rack was a big pill to swallow, but if you are an avid rider it is totally worth it.And this rack WILL fit a 4" fatbike with the additional rear wheel extension strap. the front wheel hold down is a tight fit to get up and over the fat bike tire, but with about 8psi of air in the tire it will fit up and over the tire! this rack isn't designed for a fatbike, but it will work with a 4" tire. it probably won't work if you are running a 5" fatty tire tho.the only thing i modified on this rack was some padded double sided tape on the wheel straps. I found that the hard plastic straps were scuffing my industry9 wheels. but that is just me being picky.awesome rack, looks great, love it!

I haven't used this double flair tool yet, but what they show on Amazon and what I received are different.  Wilmer shows a double flair tool with wing nuts, hardened steel inserts and a hardened steel cone.  What I got did not have the black hardened steel inserts and cone.  It also has hex head bolts instead of wing nuts.  I don't mind the hex head bolts, but not having hardned parts that do the flaring is stupid.  This set won't last more than maybe a half a dozen flairs it that.  This tool may only be useful as a paper weight for really small sheets of paper.

Fit perfectly in 2017 Chevy Cruz's Front turns signals, but hyper flashed. Needs Resistors Kit, sold separately. The appearance of "brightness" depends on reflector housings, which vary in each car. Being significantly longer than stock bulbs, the light chips are more 'forward' & may emit less reflected light from the bulb "unit". Straight-on in bright sun, they can appear less bright. When writing reviews, please indicate Year, Make & Model of your car, thank U!

I use Champion plugs quite a lot and these particular coppers are what all my B&S like to run! I always gap a new plug and these gap very easy and provide a hot spark for my engines. These plugs last a good long while and that makes my life some small bit easier.

Met ALL my expectations.  The hitch arrived in a large box. There was a hole in the middle side of the box but, curiously, the cardboard was folded inward: I think perhaps the delivery personnel used it to as a handhold?The workmanship and material of the hitch impressed me and, there was no damage to the hitch at all.Installation was a breeze. It took me longer to look up the specs and torque setting (I could not find instructions in the box) than to install it.using a jack to support the weight It took a total of 41 minutes to complete and looks great.Its embarrassing to admit but, once I started to install it, I found the instructions are tucked into the receiver!!  dummy me.

Very easy on and off.  I got inpatient and buffed it off early.  They actually say you should do the whole car and then buff it off.  That being said, this product is excellent.  My car has such a smooth shine now.  I have a 2008 Ford Mustang and the clear coat paint job isn't the greatest.  NXT makes it look great.  I do spray it with different spray waxes also.  Definitely recommend!  Update:  I have written many reviews for all the different paste waxes, spray waxes, etc.  I have most of them to be good.  After really looking at my cars finish with this squeeze out of a bottle wax :)  This has been the best wax to bring out my babies shine!  I have not tried the REALLY expensive waxes so I don't know what they would do.  For the price, this wax definitely delivers!

My car looks wicked white now and much newer. I passed it by on parking lot for a couple of times because I did not recognize it.I purchased this because I had micro rust dots on my white SUV truck. Previous owner kept the car in shaded area so it never got chance to dry well after rain. Some advisor online recommended to apply this chemical for 20 minutes and rinse. So I took my car to self wash and using home depot spray bottle applied it. It took me a little less then half bottle, so I used a little more for my brake disks as well. The smell is cherry but not overpowering, liquid turned purple where there were rust. The chemical is a PH solution so when I got some of it on my skin it did not cause any discomfort.I am planning to use the second half of the bottle and do more rubbing because first time I got lazy to do it. Here is photo of instructions on a back.

Not sure how long these guys should last. I got about 2 years out of them (I think. Not really sure how long I've been driving aground with no tail lights) The silly blue coating doesn't impress me. I am however a bit conserved about the charring around the housing. But it's a suburban sand they're notorious for running high voltage and being hard on bulbs. 2009 yukon XL

The Alloyworks Radiator arrived Well boxed and ahead of schedule..Very nice looking. The material finish including welds is great. It is hard to put in words how good it looks. When test fitting before installation it was noted the passenger side lower shroud nutsert is 1/8 inch too high. I had to open the plastic shroud hole slightly. A small issue but something to be aware of always check the fit of parts. The included cap held pressure as it should. I switched the included radiator cap for one with a release lever since I prefer to be able to allow pressure to escape before checking fluid. I replaced the hoses while I was at it and filled with Mopar Coolant a small cost to ensure a reliable system. The Radiator has kept the temperature right where it should be for the three weeks since installed and looks like a high dollar custom fabricated unit.

Picture is worth of thousand words.. See the pics.The top one is Nilight, the bottom one is another brand which is more brighter (despite low angle).Wanted to return the product as its not worth it, unfortunately my mechanic had wired it strong.Looks for alternate brands if you need a good (quality- as well, I am seeing some fog inside already) bright headlight.Do not want to name other brands as it may seem biased.. But avoid this brand.

I put these on my vehicle (2010 Honda Accord Couple) as reverse/back up lights. First impressions were that they are very bright. They definitely do a pretty good job at casting light, especially with the projection lens at the end. The LEDs surrounding the sides of the bulbs do a decent job at spreading the light around the sides. They were very easy to install and work either way you plug them in. These are the 3rd set of bulbs I have tried on my vehicle and they are definitely one of the better ones. I also have Luyed LED lights for the trunk and dome light on my vehicle and they are crazy bright. They make good quality LED lights at about half the price of other brands.The only issue I keep having with all the LED lights that I have tried are not able to do as good of a job as the incandescent bulbs at casting light on the ground directly around the back of my vehicle. I think it is just the way that my reverse/back up lights are positioned on the back of my vehicle. Though they are bright enough, I do wish they were a little longer with more LEDs around the sides of the bulbs. I think this may help with my problem.They are listed at 650 lumens and though I don't have anything to measure that with, I think that may be pretty accurate. I do prefer my LED lights to be as close to the color white as possible and I am satisfied with the color that these emit. The color temp isn't listed but I would say they are around 6000k - 6500k. I don't have anything to measure this with either so I am only basing this on my experience with other LED lights I have tried. Overall I am satisfied with these LED bulbs and they do decent job in my application as reverse/back up lights. I purchased this item at a discount or at no cost in exchange for a far, honest, and thorough review.

Got projector headlights off eBay for our 2012 Forte5 SX. Ordered the 4300K kit and single beam harness/relay. Easy install. Pretty much plug and play. Color and brightness are great. Highly recommended.UPDATE January 28,2016.Nearly 6 months and still 5 stars as far as I'm concerned. Now that they've got some hours on them, they seem whiter and brighter. A friend with a 2015 Forte EX liked how ours looked so she got them for her car.

I purchased this gun as I thought it would be a marginal step up from the HF purple gun. There is limited information available on independent forums but I figured I'd take a chance, mostly on the strength of one YT video that shows it spraying latex rather well (with the 2.5 tip). When I opened the box I was shocked to see a gouge in the air cap that went all the way through and would clearly leak air, preventing the optimum amount of air from reaching the nozzle (see pics). This should have been caught in QC. Clearly though, QC is not a priority for this manufacturer. Amazon of course handled this right and allowed me to return. Against my better judgement I ordered a replacement (this time 2.0, with a spare 2.5 needle and cap). I test sprayed a desk and was disappointed with the results. I went and purchased the $15 HF purple gun and it honestly had better finishing, QC, and produced better results. TCP Global hooked me for $60, but they'll never see another penny from me.

I have used auxiliary lights in my vehicles for quite a few years already. Hella 500 (FF, fog, etc), HID systems, LEDs... you named, I used them all. That being said, Rigid Industries are the *best* price X performance ratio for LED lights.So, I installed a pair of D2 in my Suzuki Vstrom DL650 and was looking for a way to turn the light to yellow, as I feel it would be distracting to other drivers the bright white color of the Duallies. And boy... this covers really deliver.It really turns the bright white to fog-light yellow, I included some photos comparing 1 light with and other *without* covers for reference. Could it be cheaper? Yes, sure it could... but I guess this is what you pay for quality.edit: ok, amazon has eaten the photos showing how it looks installed and how the light color changes compared to stock rigid D2.

Preparation is key. Make sure your tape is down well. You don't need a grit more abrasive than 220. Wear gloves. The most difficult part is getting it off of your hands, and protecting the truck bed from falling pollen and other things blowing in the wind while it dries. Looks great

Works great.  Easy on though you can barely see where you apply which is fine just a note.  After putting this on, it's nice and shiny, however it's not extremely hydrophobic, it does bead though.  I paired with the ice paste wax, came out great for  me.

Surprisingly, this pump performs above my expectations for its specs and price tag. The unit comes with a 1/4" fitting already installed for the older R12 1/4" gauges instead of a dual port fitting (both 1/4 & 1/2) as shown in image. I have a set of CPS MA1234 guages that has a 1/4 " female fitting on the yellow hose and they hooked up to the pumps fitting w/o using the supplied r134a 1/2" straight adapter.  The r134a adapter should be in the box..Easy oil fill, dosen't matter if you fill through the oil fill or exhaust port. Requires a 10-30 second break in period prior to first use... Anytime you remove the oil fill cap, always inspect the o-ring as mine fell off the cap and luckily I happened to notice. Also, double check drain plug prior to first oil filling out of box as mine seeped a little oil, don't over tighten, just snug as you may potentially damage o-ring... The pump comes with a hex drain bolt unlike a knurled bolt shown in image...Pump will pull a vacuum within 20 -30 minutes on a/c auto systems. After 30 minutes of operation, the unit is safe to touch ( lukewarm ). I was initially concerned with the plastic handle but it has a solid, sturdy feel. The pump will occasionally mist oil out the exhaust port, more so at vacuum start up or if overfilled. As for oil usage, I performed 5 30 minute vacuums w/o any noticeable oil loss. As for loudness, it relatively quiet and safe for indoor use, minus occasional oil mist...I've only pulled a vacuum on five auto 134a a/c systems since purchasing, 3 of these jobs were compressor burnout replacements while the other 2 were refrigerant loss / leak repairs and the oil has just now shown signs of needing to be replaced. I know every manufacturer recommends you change the oil after every use, they also recommend you use only thier brand oil.As I was saying, during the 5th vacuum I pulled I noted the oil was getting milky during vacuum operation upon visual inspection through the sight glass, although the oil was clear after shutdown. Time to change the oil as that is where all the moisture remains that doesn't get boiled off during vacuum, while the frequency of oil change intervals is debatable.... the oil will need to be changed when showing signs of cloudiness in color, poor performance or you can routinely change after every use as recommended should that be the maintenance interval you prefer, no doubt the pump will pull a quicker vacuum with fresh oil.. The pump comes with a bottle of oil that is enough for 1 1/2 fill ups....Hint: Buy a pump oil that contains no additives, as additives breakdown and contaminate quicker when mixed with moisture.Also, ensure that you install the dust cap on the pumps fitting while not in use to keep moisture out as failure to do so will shorten the oil life spanOne thing I've noticed is this pump pulls a vacuum pretty quick for its size, you can hear the change in the pump when the pump has pulled most of hte moisture out of the system. On the 3 a/c systems where I replaced the receiver driers and compressors, the pump pulled a vacuum down to 29 m and 28 m on the systems w/o drier / compressor replacement.See pics below of vacuum in progress, oil fill port, sight glass and drain plug.....I would have loved to have bought a higher end pump but funds were tight. None the less, I am very satisfied with my purchase, very smooth transaction...The only shortcoming I found.... Made in ChinaUpdate: Performed 17 auto a/c vacuums since purchase, no complaints ....

Not impressed with this guard for several reasons, first it did not cover edge to edge, it was short on both sides, second the tape began to lift in one of the hood creases after just a few days and began collecting water and debris under the guard. It is basically impossible to repair the lifting at that point and I had to remove the entire thing. I prepped the surface carefully, but the two-sided tape did not work well on my truck, a  2016 F150. Amazon is taking it back and I'll look for a more traditional bug guard that has more coverage and isn't as permanent.

High quality hitch,  perfect fit, and good price. Can't really ask for more. I don't have a full size spare, but I'm confident it would fit one.I did it by myself and it was a breeze using two car jacks. Make sure to soak the holes with wd40 or something equivalent for a good 30min to an hour. You'll thank me later.

Judging from the ad picture, part of the bumper and door are exposed. My last cover was the same way and it kept coming undone with the slightest wind. Amazon recommended the 217" but my truck is 229" so I ordered  the next size up 241".It turned out to be a good disision, the extra fabric wraps under my bumpers and completely covers the sides(see my attached picture). I removed the antenna, I put up my cargo-net up to hopefully eliminate any rain water from pooling up in the bed, a tonneau cover would've been ideal but I may just purchase a kid's inflatable toy to hold up the cover.Bottom line, know the dimensions of your vehicle, and go from there.Update.............Just had some rain and this cover is definitely water tight. Unfortunately my cargo-net isn't strong enough to keep the water from pulling up in the bed. For now I'm using a road cone in the center of the bed.Im definitely impressed with this cover.Update,,,,,,,,,,,I've had my truck parked for probably over five months and to my surprise, my truck looks as clean as the day that I covered it. This cover is amazing!Thank you.

The Collapsible Car Trunk Organizer from EPAuto is a fantastic organizer for the trunk of a car, SUV or even home. It is a very large 24.75 x 12.75 x 13.4 and holds a good amount of groceries, cleaning supplies or tools. It has 2 compartments and 2 hard base pieces which fold down to provide strength and stability, There are also 8 mesh pockets on the outside of the organizer. The organizer has 2 handles for easy removal and is collapsible when not used. I love having this organizer for my SUV, it has reduced clutter and I can finally have all my emergency vehicle supplies in once place.I received this product for FREE in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

I ordered this and the Auto Meter 2277 Metric adapter for my 5.3 LS swap into my 1969 Chevy Truck with stock gauges. . It fits the adapter just fine. . people who are having trouble with the adapters, from what I have been told from Auto Meter are trying to run the senders that come with their Auto Meter gauge and I guess those are different according to Auto Meter. So to clarify, if you run this sender with a 2277 Auto Meter adapter, It will work. . . Hopefully this helps someone in the future. i know i was confused when ordering. happy to report, it works.

This set of pry tools useful for the purpose of removing a car audio panel. This is as good a deal as I've seen for a 12-piece set, and one can go pretty far with this set and not be in extreme danger of damaging the front panel.Beyond this, one might want to get a panel clip removal pliers, and to round out the collection, a car door panel trim remover handle window upholstery clip set.I think this is a very useful set for most cars.Car tool set received for sincere review.

I have purchased 3 of these so far. One for my LTZ400, one for my DR650 and another for my buddies old Honda ATC 250 three wheeler. These batteries are absolutely awesome. They crank over each of the machines without any hesitation. So far I have been using these for about 4 months with no issues whatsoever. Having the LCD is insanely convenient too, as you can always see where your battery voltage is without the need for a multimeter. I always ride my machines consistently, or hook them up to a CTEK battery maintainer if they won't be used for a while.When you don't have kick-start as a backup option, you had better have a dependable battery, and I believe this one fits that bill.UPDATE 12/7/2016: Purchased on Feb 28th 2016, and installed immediately. So lets Say March 1st 2016 was its first use. It is now December of 2016, and the battery will no longer reliably crank my ATV. Despite being regularly connected to a CTEK battery tender, and at least weekly use of the ATV it was installed in, the battery died this past weekend on me while way out in the sticks. Luckily, I was with friends and we were able to bump start the ATV and I was not stranded. The screen also partially died a few weeks ago and only half the display works. For $30ish, this is still not a bad deal, but I did expect to get more than 10 months use out of it. I checked stator output as well as parasitic draw, and all is electrically sound with the ATV, so it has to be a cell within the battery dying. Star count lowered from 5 to 2 due to this early failure. I also have one of these in my DR650 Dual Sport, which seems to still be working, but that one was purchased in late March, so I will update if that battery also fails.

This chain is made of SOFT , NON HARDENED steel. I was able to cut it with a hacksaw within a few minutes - see image. Saw cuts through it like through butter unlike the "hardened" steel. To give you an idea, it took me same amount of time to cut through this chain as it did through a little locker padlock. The only advantage of this chain is that it has a noose and looks sort of intimidating, but the guys who steal bikes for a living will know that this chain is garbage and will cut through it within a minute. Save your money and buy a more expensive chain that will actually work...

After reviewing several 7" windshields on Amazon, I decided on this one (TMS 7" Smoke Tint Windshield For 96-13 Harley Touring). It was very well packed to prevent any damage/scratching during shipping. Installation was fairly easy, with just a little pushing to get it in place. I have a Three-Pocket Fairing Pouch and this shield extends about 2 inches above that.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/TMS-7-quot-Smoke-Tint-Windshield-For-96-13-Harley-Touring-Street-Glide-Electra-FLHT/dp/B00FRSUWFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">TMS 7" Smoke Tint Windshield For 96-13 Harley Touring Street Glide Electra FLHT</a>After the install, I noticed there were quite a few scratches, which I obviously did during installation. I used a little Nova plastic polish which made it better, but there were still a lot of swirls and small scratches. I then used a little Pledge furniture polish on a micro fiber cloth. It looks great now! I don't know if using furniture polish on a motorcycle windshield is a good thing and your mileage may vary, but it worked for me.The "smoke tint" is pretty dark. You can see through it, but I'm betting you can't see through it at all during night riding. It is only 7" tall though and I'm looking over it by a couple of inches. I was using a 10" Harley Windsplitter before installing this one, and it was right at eye-level, so I had to sit straight while riding to see over it. This 7" shield is much better. I've included some photos below, including one looking though the smoke tint.

Take your paint job to a higher level. I make mantel clocks and always wondered why I could not get my paint to be as shinny as my pickup until I came across Spraymax clear coat. The can only last about 12 hours time span in the can after you hit the button on the bottom of the can and let the clear spray and the hardener mix. I will line up 4 of 5 mantel clocks and it will be more than enough to spray them. And if I did my job right, man what a deep crystal clear shinny smooth shine. Now I can finish my painting to look like the shine on my truck.

I put this on my 30 year old stove about a month ago and it went on easily, worked great and a month later it shows no signs of wear.  I really wish I'd taken a "before" picture -- but just imagine how a stove would look after 30 years.

Installing it once kind of a pain because the holes on the bumper that are made to receive the 8 screws on the Jeep for attachment did not line up perfectly. I had to get a drill and make some of the holes on the bumper a little bigger for it to fit on the Jeep. The only other minor problem is the pain job. The paint has chipped in some places, especially where the shackles go, but nothing a little bit of black nail polish cant fix.Other than that I love this bumper, very well constructed and an awesome look for you Jeep. The holes for the fog lights are a little far apart, but with some patience it is possible, you just have to separate some of the wires that are taped together. Would Definitely buy again.

The light came on time. They had the simplest of packaging inside the Amazon box. The packaged included 4 light strips, exactly 30cm each. There were no instructions however it is not hard to figure out how to connect these. I though they would be brighter then what they actually are. So I decided instead of putting them under the car, to try and instal them inside to illuminate the floor.The lights are attached by adhesive strip, no bolts necessary. The wires are somewhat shorter and need extensions.I would like to disclose that I did receive this product at a discounted price for the unbiased and honest opinion and was not compensated in any other way.

The quality is everything I was expecting... fittings, hose and the gauge itself are industrial / high quality.  For some reason, the only one of the two filler valves is the lock on style. The one facing back at you locks on to the Schrader valve by means of internal grooves (essentially female threads). The other one has a smooth bore. Not sure if this was intentional...Not that it is a defect with this specific product, but I wish all filler valves of this style would operate to show the air hose pressure while the tire is being pressurised.  Presently, it registers zero while filling the tire and only registers the tire pressure when the valve is released. Many shops will install a tee & gauge inline for this very reason. In my opinion it could / should be built in to the device by reconfiguring the poppet valve.  It's a simple change to the valve configuration internally, and I have made this modification to mine.Additionally, I modified the aluminum body by drilling and tapping the side to install a minature bleeder valve. This allows me to dump air from the tire, and also to force my air compressor to kick on when the pressure is similar to that of the tire being filled.  The picture shows the location of the 1/8 NPTF for the valve.  Correct placement is required to ensure that multiple air passageways are not connected accidentally.Also, I installed an inline regulator which I set to the desired tire pressure. This modification in combination with the lock-on filler allows it to be a hands-free operation.Lastly, I added a quick connect between the double head filler and the flexible hose.  Just my personal preference which allow for the attachment of other size fillers, blow gun and some other devices which are customized for my shops use.

I used this on my UTV that had not even been washed in quite a while.  The results were outstanding.  In the first photo, you can easily see where I have cleaned half of the hood with Star brite Ultimate Bike Guard and left the other half dirty.  The second photo shows the completed job.  Keep in mind that this is a well-used (i.e., neglected) UTV with a lot of scratches from driving through the woods.  While you can still see some of the deeper scratches in the plastic, this product made most of the minor scratches disappear and made the entire vehicle look tons better, all in about 10 minutes.  The dirt comes off easily with this and it really shines when you are finished.The fragrance is simply awesome.  I will next be using this to detail the inside of my truck.

I had a stock bumper before and this is such a change. I love it. Installation was easy. I mounted the winch to the bumper and then installed it all together which made it much easier. It went on great. I spray painted the d-rings and nameplate metallic red before I added them on.

For the money this is an unbelievable piece.  Things to note; it will require some "massaging" with a heat gun and the texture is not 'bumpy' but rather a smooth finish.  The only areas slightly warped were where the edges turned up to meet the fender.  However, as shown in the pictures you can get an acceptable fit with a slight investment in time.  I'm also certain most higher priced lips would require some modification as well.  Came with plenty of hardware. Excellent value.

I've purchased a bunch of different automotive LED bulbs before and I have gotten some poor quality bulbs before. The LUYLED bulbs are high quality. The build quality is excellent. These are 1157 bulbs so they have two contacts at the end for cars that use dual filament brake light bulbs. It functions as the tail light at night when your headlights are on, then they increase brightness when you step on the brakes. I am impressed with the quality and light output on the bulbs. When I am looking to buy some more LED bulbs, I will definitely look for some more LUYED bulbs. I received this product for free or at a significant discount for my honest and unbiased review.

I purchased two sets of these LED's to replace the OEM map lights and license plate bulbs for a 2012 Hyundai Santa Fe. The license plate bulbs look great and fit snug, distributing a decent amount of light onto the plate without being too much light. Unfortunately, the map lights didn't respond quite as nicely. The angle of the sockets in relation to the inset mirror and port don't work well with these LED's - illumination isn't very good on the passenger side map light (driver's side is okay).That being said, LED's are known to be hit or miss with many vehicle applications and it tends to be a trial and error process to find the best option. I've ordered a couple different 360-degree LED's to try in the map lights. As for the license plate lights, I'm very satisfied with these.Regarding the color, these seem to be about 6000k (light blue hue) - very crisp and clean.

The outer tie rods were a full inch shorter than the stock parts.  The inners were half an inch shorter, so I had to return these parts.  Their return policy stinks so check that before buying.  These parts may fit your car buy they did not fit my 2002 V6 Mustang convertible.

Awesome add-on to the rack. I'm looking forward to using it. The only down-side is it makes the rack weigh almost 90lbs. But it's sturdy. It's like carrying a small person awkwardly spread out to put it on my hitch. Regardless, I love it! Assembled just how it should and had everything with it. Once the price went down to $245 I jumped at it. Also added some great length to my 1990 G30 Van.

I was in need of two of these items, I purchased two of them simply for cosmetic purposes for my RV due to my turning yellowish after being 11 years old. These looked just like the ones that I needed in order to replace my original ones. Upon arrival I unboxed them and removed that old ones. Immediately I noticed the screw holes did not match up which wasn't that big of a deal cause I just tapped into my joists elsewhere. However the kicker was when I these brand new ones are not as deep as the originals. The original part is 1" deeper than this new. Old one measured 5 1/4" while the new one was only 4 1/4", an inch difference. Good Luck, I would warn you to measure yours before you purchase one online. The part itself is of good plastic quality.

Just installed these. My e39 looks updated with these LEDs. No more yellowish angel eyes. Nice brilliant white LED lights. Not the brightest as they wash out in direct sunlight, but look great as the sun goes down and going through tunnels. Knew that before purchasing. Worth the few dollars spent. Not sure how long they will last, but for under 18 bucks, you can't go wrong. Just pick up a higher K set later or buy two of these!

I used a multimeter to measure the actual amperage and wattage draw. At 12 volts they use 0.09 amps, or 1.08 watts. They are no where near 9 watts. However they are fairly bright and I am going to use two on the front of my motorcycle for turn signals.Update 5/31/2017:I have installed 8 of these lights on my motorcycle as turn signals. I spent great care and time to protect and route the wiring. I soldered every thing together. After a 15 mile ride, only 3 of the 8 lights are still working. The wiring used in the lights is extremely small and fragile, I can't see these being suitable for any type of vehicle.

Awesome affordable winch, and cheap shipping to Hawaii!  I installed this 9500lb winch onto my 2006 Nissan Xterra Offroad.  The installation is very simple with the instructions given.  Both the wiring and the clocking of the gear housing was simple as pie.The winch came boxed up really well to avoid damage during shipping.  Utilizing both Styrofoam and multi-layer cardboard, the winch came undamaged all the way to Hawaii.  The winch is very heavy, so be careful when moving the box around.I mounted the solenoid relay box inside of the bumper and relocated the remote connector onto the grille.The handheld remote has a magnet on the end, to just stick it onto a metal surface, like your fender or bumper.  Would've been cool if the surface was rubberized, to prevent scrataching and marring of the surface you stick it onto.  Not a deal breaker tho.The connector is not engineered right for the application.  The source-side connector is composed of male pins.  This is a no-no.  Source side should always be female to prevent objects from going inside and shorting the circuitry out.

What a money saver!?! So much cheaper than the factory OEM lock and works just as well (if not better).  Just a word of the wise for anyone who hasn't installed it, your key will not remove unless in the locked position so ensure that you don't pull your key out and then expect to slam the hood.  Even if you have to buy a HD Rivet gun, your still money ahead!

Just what I needed to protect a vulnerable electrical harness on my car from excessive header heat.  It looks super cool, can be trimmed with scissors, has a longitudinal slit for easy installation and shouldn't drip like my original polyethylene conduit!  (I did and still do have some backup manifold wrap around the electrical harness to protect it)I ordered it on Thursday Jan 26, with a target delivery date of Feb 7.  It arrived the following Monday, Jan 29.  Now that's awesome!

As an auto detailer I use this along with my hot water carpet extractor. I first vacuum the carpets and seats if they're cloth. Then spray them down with a hot water and Chemical Guys Fabric Clean solution. I then scrub with this brush in a cordless drill. It does a great job of pulling out dirt, sand, pet hair, you name it. Then I take the extractor and suck up what's left on the carpet.Anyone can use this carpet brush to clean their car's interior. Take a normal spray bottle and any car soap to make a sudsy solution. First vacuum up what you can then spray the entire floor... lay it on heavy in really stained spots until the carpet is almost soaked. Then use this brush in your cordless drill to scrub them clean. Then take a wet/dry shop vac to suck up the dirt and what water you can. Just be sure to let the carpets thoroughly dry so they don't mold. Works like magic!

I bought these to replace my factory halogen amber turn signal/parking light bulbs on my Monte Carlo. I can vouch for JDM ASTAR products when it comes to quality, price, and performance of their LED bulb lineup. They just keep getting better and better! I have replaced just about every bulb on my Monte Carlo, both interior and exterior (even my low-beam headlights) with this brand and I have never been disappointed.At first I didn't think I would like the flashbacks, and I would return them for the all amber bulbs. Once I installed them, and seen how good they looked, they were keepers. I have the JDM ASTAR 7th gen headlight bulbs for low beams, and even though they are super bright, my headlight assemblies don't provide a wide beam pattern like the newer cars do. These bulbs aid that issue very well and works with the headlights to make a much wider beam. Also if I'm parked somewhere, these light up the area in front of my car fairly well to where I can see everything without the use of turning on the headlights. My car already uses the high beams at half power as daytime driving lights, so I don't use these bulbs for that purpose, but would work for those who don't have that feature. I absolutely love the amber part of these bulbs. I've always liked how LED lights are much more responsive over halogens as turn signals. It just looks better too. It's a pure amber color that goes on-off-on-off instantaneously. Halogens have more delay turning on which means the other drivers have less time to respond depending on how you use your turn signals. There is no delay with LEDs, turning on instantly at the same time you engage your blinker. These are the best flashback LED bulbs available by this brand, providing better reaction time, visibility and safety for you and your surrounding drivers.It would be silly to not buy these.

Ive always bought the well known name brand blades because wipers are very important for safety. These blades are what I would call reasonable, not as much as some of the better ones but yet affordable.  Of course they are 100% plastic and very lightweight. There is a lot of wiggle at the hinge point and I question how well it would hold up in snow, slush or torrential rains.I do like the aerodynamic shape, it helps hold them against the windshield at higher speeds.One important thing to know, and I realize this could have been made clearer if they actually told you this, is that these have a lime green piece of plastic that is supposed to protect the blade before you install it. I didn't know that immediately and it looked like the blades were actually green, which would have been unusual (although they would have been a perfect match for my lime green car).It looks like some customers installed them on their car with the green protector still in place and tried to use them that way. That's not going to work very well and could be dangerous. I suggest that the manufacturer makes that a little more clear next time they writes the instructions that these are not actually green wipers and that the protector has to be removed before using.

This is a great product. It's a much thicker and harder "plastic" than what you may think of (vinyl wrap)One roll did my Subaru Crosstrek.I did get left with many small bubbles, but that's not so much the products fault, as I am terrible at applying these things. But I was able to use a pin and poke out most of the air holes. While the 5-7/8" with was just wide enough to do my door, it wrapped nicely (use a hair dryer or heat gun), and so far shows no sign of peeling up around my terrible corner job.

I just received this last week and has already put it to good use 3 days in a row.  I do sound reinforcement for events, and have a populated 10u slanted mixer rack weighing around 140 lbs, which I had to lift at least 4 times for each event, which is a back breaker.I had tried aluminum loading ramp, which is also heavy and bulky to load in the suv (since I need the ramp to load and unload the rack).  Beside that, I still have to push and pull the rack up/down the ramp.  So that didn't work out that well.I decided to try this jack.  It has worked out almost perfectly.  The thing still is a little heavy, but it's a lot more compact than a pair of loading ramps.  It also help with lifting the mixer rack up to the stage (some stage is 3ft high).  So this jack has saved my back quite a bit, as I normally work alone.If they could make it out of strong aluminum, instead of steel, to cut down the weight, I will buy it in a heartbeat since this jack still weighs over 60 lbs.Have used it to lift and transport the mixer rack to 3 separate events, and have not experience any leak (it was kept in jacked up position of about 24 inches for an average 6 hours at each event, as well as overnight when I got home, with the mixer rack on top).Obviously, I have to make sure the whole thing is balanced and stable while handling.

Excellent product. Curvature of the strips was perfect, the lengths and width of the strips were right on, and the stickiness of the glue appears to be very good. It does help to have paddock stands to install this product, but in my case I simply had to roll the bike forward and backwards as necessary in order to expose the area that I needed to access. It is also important to clean the rims with soap and water and then with alcohol. And also make sure your hands are very clear and free of oils as you will need to have the tape stick to various fingers as you guide the application enf of each strip. Overlap the ends by 1/4" and as you apply the tape just tap it into position at 1 to 1-1/2" gaps and when all of the strip is placed, run your finger along the strip from start to end to complete the stick-down operation. I have a head-mounted LED light which I found to be indispensable in getting the strip laid down right. Once the wheel is done use a soft cloth to go all around the tape one final time to ensure that nothing is missed and there are no air bubbles. You are then good to go.

Good upgrade for 2016 JK Rubicon Hard Rock or any JK or JKU, because they are very bright.If you are planning on installing guards or cages over your tail lights, you may need 4 longer screws (#8 sheet metal screw x 2 1/4 to 2 3/8) for the two outside screws that go into the plastic housing of the light. I installed the Mopar cages and needed to change out the screws. I purchased stainless steel #8 x 2 1/2 and cut the screws down to the desired length with journeyman pliers and painted the head black.In regards to fit, the contours of the housing appear to be slightly off in that it's not as tight of a fit as the OEM. The JW Speaker installation video on YouTube tells you to shift them around until you have a right seal. However, I have been unable to achieve the same tight seal as the OEM lights had. I have come to the conclusion there there may be a slight design flaw in the contours of the plastic housing of the light compared to the curves of a JK or JKU. I also had the same problem as another reviewer where the driver side tabs kept wanting to pop out.Otherwise, the construction and workmanship of the light seem great.

I know this is not exactly a good product review since the problem was Amazon system saying it was compatible with my Vehicle.But I cannot rate it higher than one star simply because for most people this is a fix that you do only once on your vehicle, which means it that most people won't know how the original part looks until they have remove it from the engine, and by then is too late.I spend 30 minutes removing this pressure switch the first time because it had dirt on it and was kinda stuck on the car, after some struggling I was able to remove it only to find out it was not the right one, which meant I had to reinstall the faulty part return this item and wait more days for the correct one to arrive, since no local stores had it at the time.The correct part was this one http://amzn.com/B004JA7Q6I

i will get back and update my review after i use it extensively, but as for quality, value, etc, i am very happy.  glad i saved up the extra for this one.  battery cable was perfect length for my 2009 jeep wrangler.  i also used the Rock Hard 4x4 OEM bumper winch mounting plate with the Rock Hard grill guard tube as well. (mounting plate is part number RH5010, and tube/ grill guard part number is RH5015).  makes a very nice looking setup.  very aggressive looking.  this winch is very beefy and well made.  if you are mounting the control box on the winch as pictured, you will need to remove two bolts that hold the two top stainless support bars to mount the bracket (included).  just be sure to mount the control box to the bracket first, then wire up the control box, then mount it to the winch itself last.  be sure to install the rubber boots onto the wiring terminals.  you can use alittle liquid dish soap (just a drop for each) to make the rubber boots slide on better as they are a tight fit.

Easy to install on my Kawasaki Mean Streak, it provides a vast improvement in looks and is much easier to press into the brakes than the stock "rubber pad".  Adds a more tactile, refined feel to your foot controls.I installed the pedal cover in combination with the Kuryakyn Spear mini-boards and am extremely happy with the quality and look of the Kuryakyn products. Yes, the Asian Kuryakyn "knock-off" products are much cheaper, but you'll be replacing those in less than one year.  The Kuryakyns will last the lifetime of your cycle with minimal maintenance.

The jacket was better than expected, and it gets compliments on a weekly basis. I wear this jacket for daily commuting to and from work (30 minutes each way). In spite of multiple 25-30 degree days in January, I've never gotten cold in this jacket. Shipping was fast and packaging was great.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the zipper started separating from the lining in the first week. The thread connecting the quilted lining to the zipper isn't very heavy-duty, and started unraveling (see picture). This will continue to get worse over time, but it's not worth sending the jacket back because it's an easy fix with needle and thread.

Bought these to try out as either an engine bay light or DRL. Bought two sets initially and installed first set as an engine bay light in a 2004 Audi A4. These are amazing for engine bay lights. They are extremely bright for their size and are perfect for my needed application. I have another set to install as DRL but for now I am 100% satisfied with these as an engine bay light. I do a lot of my own maintenance and trying to hang a light in the engine bay of this vehicle is a pain so I opted to try these out. Ran them to a magnetic switch so they only turn on when the hood is popped and presto, light! Even though I still have another set to experiment with, I am certain I will be buying more of these.*Note- in the two photos I have included they are in a pitch black garage. No other light source is on in these pictures.*

Was simple to put together even though instructions were garbage and a couple washers were missing... You get what you pay for though and this does a great job for its price. On higher vehicles the ramp angle can be steep and traction is slippery. I ended up spraying bedliner on the ramp and some of the main bolts. It hold my CRF 150 on my Jeep TJ great and doesn't wobble!

My application was a pre-2008 Ventline replacement. (Fits several other applications.) Following the instructions was easy until it came time to slide the hinge apart. Some dumb guy (me) had gotten roof sealer in the hinge. Arc joint pliers and a hammer were needed to slide the hinge apart. Re-assembly was a snap. By the time I finished, it was raining. I'm glad I didn't wait until the last minute. HA! The white color looks better with the white ceiling that the original smoke color.The instructions just say to re-assemble in the reverse order of dis-assembly. Thats true, except that the friction clip goes on the opposite side from where it was originally. Photo shows how I installed my clips.

Over the past few years I have ordered several of these solar panels to keep the batteries topped off in a few company trucks that may sit for a few months at a time.  So far they have done a great job in the hot Arizona sun although the suction cups may turn amber in color and the plastic frame around the glass housing may warp, they still continue to deliver a trickle charge to the battery through the cigarette lighter plug.  The reason I'm giving the panel 3 stars instead of 5 is that NOCO appears to have changed the design of cigarette light adapter omitting the red light that was present on my previous panel purchases.  There are several product images that clearly show the plug with the small red indicator light.  The issue with not having the indicator light would be problematic since you won't be able to easily determine if the 12 volt accessory plug has power with the ignition off.  By plugging the cigarette cable end in to a "dead" socket, no power will flow back to the battery therefore giving you the false impression that you are maintaining your battery.  Since most cars now don't have the cigarette heating element, you won't be able to tell if the socket is hot and most people don't carry a test light or volt meter in their car to verify power.  Most of our older Ford trucks have hot accessory plugs but from 2015 and on, the plugs are not powered unless the key is on.  I will call NOCO and verify the change and will update my review accordingly.Update 8/10/17 - A representative from NOCO emailed back today and confirmed that the red indicator light has been removed do to customers concerned of battery drainage at night.  I can't imagine much draw overnight from such a small light.  Most consumers have illuminated cell phone charges in the cars that stay on all of the time night and day that probably draw more from the battery.  You can however purchase separately, NOCO Genius GC003 12V Plug Connector (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/NOCO-Genius-GC003-12V-Plug-Connector/dp/B004LWWNI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">NOCO Genius GC003 12V Plug Connector</a>) that has the indicator light that is no longer available with the solar kit.  Kudos to NOCO's customer service for responding back so quickly!

This worked out great! I purchased this for my Vespa S 50cc scooter. A size Medium fit perfectly. If you have a trunk, basket, or windshield I would recommend you go with the Large. I wish I purchased the Large so I could attach a basket to the backend but I'm still happy with my purchase. It is waterproof, I poured water on it and it just slid right off. I love the soft inner material, it's definitely gentle on my scooter. The color is nice also. I've had this cover on my scooter for a few weeks now and it definitely seems like it will last. If you have a small 50cc scooter/moped/vespa I would definitely recommend this! A size Medium fits like a glove. Buy this! You won't regret it.

When adding a 02-07 WRX exhaust on a 04-08 Forester XT, you need to use these hangers to get the proper clearance for the exhaust. You only need two for the muffler tip. The other hangers either need to be cut and re-welded or not use them. The material is sturdy and not squishy like the OEM hangers.

Fit my 2017 edge perfectly. Didn't have to adjust hood bumpers which is good because I don't think I have them. Little tricky to pull out the plastic pieces but just do it by pulling on the weather stripping. Don't tighten down screws until all in holes. Make sure u put the bug deflector underneath the weatherstripping

I Bought these because i plan to get HID lights going and want my fog lights to match,  they are a bit whiter than my friends 6000k HIDS and i think they would match 5000k perfectly.  A lot of people here say these do not project more light than halogen,  not the case for me.  maybe its my housing, maybe my halogens were really old but before i put these in my fog lights were on because i thought they looked cool.  but these are actually illuminating stuff! I can see the difference when i turn them on or off its great.  Recomend 100 percent.  And they do look awesome too.

You know I had a Starving John deere x540  under heavy loads. The Little fuel filter wasn't letting the X540 Do it's thing.  I resently purchased the K&N PF-2300 Fuel filter. Best thing I ever did. I took off the Little factory filter and within 5 minutes  2 small clamps and a screw drive I installed the K&N Fuel Filter and the results were unbelivable. WAY  WAY  WAY more throttle and no more starving for fuel under a load.  GREAT PRODUCT  K&N  Keep up the GREAT WORK.  Ken  West Virginia

Which doesn't affect the way it operates, not that I noticed anyway, but I just wanted to put it out there.The ballasts are quiet large but I managed to snug them up behind the washer fluid tank and the airbox in my 2013 Sonata. For the price they aren't bad and are definitely brighter than stock headlights, however, cops and state inspectors will give you no love no matter which HID kits you install.***Update***: The bulb actually did not die out, it was a fault in the ballast. So the ballasts died out before either of the bulbs did. Great upgrade is you're moving up from OEM halogen bulbs, but longevity is a big mystery.

I wish packaging was better, I did not receive any hardware as it was lost on the way together with the instructions.Instructions are easy too look up on-line but looking for missing nuts and bolts is a pita.Also the hitch is built way too wide, I had hell of a time attaching it to the truck and had to use 4 feet extension on my wrench just to barely make the side supporting plates touch the frame.I have no idea why it is purposely build so wide (as per manual), can't they measure the frame and build it with-in 1/4 to 1/2 inch tolerance?I had about 1 inch extra space on each side that was just painful to mount and still looks bad. And I had to use sledge hammer just to bend the side plate enough so the bolts would even bite. Overall not very happy with the mounting process.

It does not hint at other colors and that is what I wantedMost of the other kits do not come with as many bulbs, so this does a great job at replacing every possible bulb inside the cab with LEDsLED spacing and alignment on each bulb looks great**CONS**The website on the packaging and box does not exist; does notThere is nothing included in the packaging to say what is what or where the bulbs are located (see below for what I went with)Does not replace front foot area OEM LEDs (they are yellowish in color)Install tipsKit comes with(6) 3x4 strips (4 replace the door flood lights & 2 for the trunk)(2) Mini bulb lights w/1 LED (1 for glove box and 1 for license plate)(4) Sun visor lights (2 per sun visor)(4) Mini bulb lights w/5 LEDs (2 front overhead dome lights and 2 rear overhead lights)Check YouTube for how to move covers on dome lightsDouble sided tape works great on overhead bulbsThe glove box switch and light pops up for easy accessIf the LEDs do not light up, flip them around, they only work one way but will physically fit both ways.

Installed and tested. The instructions sheet as very generic and vague to depending on what vehical it is being installed on. This particular model of damper seems to fit a number of types of Ford vehicles. If you have experience and mechanical skills its takes about an hour provided you have all the tools at hand. You most likely will need a drill with a good sharp long 3/8" bit. I have installed a number of these dampers on older pick-up trucks in the past. Do make sure the damper is properly centered as not not resrict the steering left and right movement. The instructions are clear on this. There was enough hardware in the kit to make it work on my 1990 Ford Econoline E-350 Class-C Motorhome. The motor home chassis is the Ford E350 Custom Cab. Basically a cut out unit on a 1 ton frame. I did have to drill holes through both side of the  square box frame. See pictures. I used the outer support plate as the template for the holes and just drilled through both of the box frame walls. This damper really did help eliminate  the side to side drifting of the steerer wheels. This is not a re-centering steering kit nor should it be expected to be. It is a damper, period!

Used it along with knifeless tape to install racing stripes on my bmw. 3M is always easy to work with and very forgiving. Compared to some off brand cheap vinyl, this is just beyond amazing. Whereas the cheap vinyl wrinkles and is impossible to get the wrinkle out, 3M material allows you to reheat and get rid of the wrinkles easily.

Has it all, love this alarm..  Does everything as described. Problems I had we're 1st off,  it's not H-D friendly. I don't have all the plastic that sports bikes do so it took me a while to find a spot where you cant reach into and cut wires. If you have problems, you may want to check the connecters. After using it trouble free for a week or so it wouldn't arm, after checking it over I found a wire had come loose from the main connect. I took it all apart and hard wired it. (I'll add pics) haven't had a problem with it since. I took some time before giving feedback. Wanted to test it out for a while, hit a couple potholes and hit the throttle hard! Haven't had any trouble since. Yes even needing to cut and hard wire this, I still give it 5 star's..  It work's that good!!

I bought these because I needed more light for backing up since I installed my backup camera inside the car.  At first I bought cheaper $7 ones from eBay that looked good, but the output was actually less than the OEM incandescent bulb.  So then I bought this much more expensive LEDs based on the reviews people put on here.  I am glad I did and do not regret it one bit.  It is definitely brighter than the OEM bulbs, and I believe the side LEDs on the this bulb helps quite a bit for the backup light's reflective housing to reflect as much light as possible.  I would say these lights are about 50% brighter than the original incandescent bulbs, though I have no equipment to actually test that.  Hopefully these bulbs will last a long time, especially at the more expensive price I paid.Pros:-easy to install, plug-and-play-definitely brighter than OEM bulbsCons:-expensive

It probably would have gotten five starts if the kit came with the right nuts.  Everything was great until it came time to install the bracket onto the driver's side spring u-bolt.  The kit came with the wrong nuts.  They were way too big and the threads were fine-thread.  I had to go to three different places to find the right size nuts. Also, one of the shocks did not come with a zip tie to attach the boot.The big question is; did it make a difference?  Yes.  The original stabilizer on the truck was shot.  It wasn't really doing anything.  This kit stopped my truck from darting around the road so much.  For me, it's a big improvement.  I still need a steering box replacement though.  Considering my utterly ruined steering box, this kit really did make a noticeable improvement.  Can't wait to see how it is when the box is replaced!The pic attached shows the kit installed. The boots are different lengths because I zip-tied them in different spots.  The shocks are actually evenly extended.

I agree with most of the the other users. The provided plastic adapters that are used  to fit this bulb to the existing headlight housing are flimsy.  This also causes a small (very minimal) amount of instability to the bulb .Thicker plastic would make a huge difference to correct this issue.Not that I had to but I decided to install twist ties across the bulb to stabilize it. Additionally I put some electrical tape around the base. Overall the bulb seems excellent for the price. The install was simple and everything works as intended. Updates to come with more testing and usage.

A good kit. Not a great kit. The first thing I did was lube the threads with anti seize compound to prevent galling. I immediately noted that the threads were not cut well and took cleaning with a thread file to correct. Once done the pieces worked well together.This is a good kit for occasional use. Not for the day to day mechanic. These pieces appear to have a short life span.See my attached photos for the kit contents.

These lights are just what I wanted for my ATV. I have not installed them yet, but have checked them on the bench with the power supply. The brightness & area covered by the beams are great for an ATV or similar vehicle. Of course, while one light is great, I am referring to both lights together. The 'spot' type is the way to go on these type lights for use as headlights. The spot is not THAT tight. The flood types are too wide, and are less concentrated, so they don't look as bright (as headlights). The spots have it. A great thing about LEDs is they give you about the same brightness as incandescent/halogen bulbs, but at 80% less power, and run cooler (but still have some heat). As with all these LED lights of numerous styles, none of them are rated by the specs correctly. Going by Ohms Law (relationship of Voltage, Current, & Watts[power]), all of the LED headlight type lights I've purchased & tested are less actual power than rated. The 36Watt Bar style (7in spot or flood) actually use about 26-28W at 12.5Volts DC. Adjusting the voltage some does not bring them up to the rated power. The 72W (13in spot or flood) uses about 54-58W at 12.5VDC. I have also tested a 144W spot/flood combo, 48W & 27W square spot and 27W round, 15W spot (like the style I'm reviewing here), 18W rectangle-style spot, 18W surface mount, this 18W spot light, and several 10W, 12VDC wall-mount wide-angle flood lights. Every LED light was significantly lower in power than rated. The higher the power, the bigger the difference; I guess it's a certain percent each light drops. All were bought two at a time, and some lights more than two. So I have checked enough of these LED types & styles & powers to know it's just the way it is with these lights. My buddy has had the same experience as well. I also suspect the rated Lumen output (brightness) is not what it actually is, but I don't care to buy a light meter and check all the lights under the proper guidelines. With all that being said, if the LEDs are not being pushed to their power limit, they are straining less, and have less current drain on your battery/alternator. Also, as I said above, these 18W 'Spot Work Light Off Road' are a VERY bright package, great for ATV headlights. A single one would be good for a truck cargo light, back-up light, trailer hitch light, maybe several on a 15' fishing boat for night fishing. They look & feel good and solid. I have bought other Nilight LED lights and been happy with them. I hope this review helps a lot of folks. I had a lot of questions when I started looking into LED headlights for my ATV. Pics below; night one is 40ft to the camo woodpile. The first pics are the 15W LEDs, like this light, but less power. Red Honda pics are 18W LED, but a rectangle style. Lights are at same distance, but not aimed exactly the same. And the camera does not see all the overspray to the sides and beyond the main beams. Much more side & downroad light is seen than shown.If you want to keep reading... I contacted 4 or 5 dealers I purchased from on Ebay, providing the exact voltage, current, & power readings/calculations for the different lights I bought from each one of them. I did not ask for a refund, credit, or threaten anything, I just gave them the facts and asked 'Why less actual power than it's rated?' They did not have a clue about Ohms Law, made jokes, some excuses so lame they were borderline stupid. Questioned my word and facts. So I gave them no reviews. On that site, everybody passes or fails on the customer reviews. Oh, well.

Holy cow these are awesome. Upon looking for something fun to do, we decided to make a silverado awesome. With the limo tint installed and the blacked out taillights, it's hard to see when reversing. But when you cut into your chrome bumper and wire up four of these bad boys to a switch AND the reverse lights...well you're basically harnessing the power of the sun in your rear end. Take that mom, I really do have sunshine coming out my a** now. They're probably not the brightest on the market, or the floodiest, but they are a solid and BRIGHT product - illuminating at least 1/10th of a mile. Wiring was easy, but I'm a semi-pro at that. 10/10 would recommend.

Bought these for the back of my Kubota RTV. I feed livestock at night in the winter. I mounted one above the bed and one below. More light then I needed and expected. Not sure if you could call it a flood or spot. It's just a lot of light. Easily lights up a 25' distance to work by.They have a heavy pigtail wire/cord to work with. the mounting hardware is good quality. Had lots of adjustment. Been using them for 2 weeks now and have no issues.

I ordered these and I also have the previous generation of this LED. They managed to cram an additional column of LEDs in the center on both sides. That is about the only change I can see when looking at them side by side - the components on the board appear to be the same. The previous generation was already crazy bright and this just takes it up to 11. These LEDs are several times brighter than your old incandescent bulbs. They are extremely impressive.I was putting the new LEDs in one reverse housing and the previous generation in the other housing. The obvious observation was that they are really bright and starring at them messes with your vision and causes you to have to wait a few minutes before you change LEDs out to compare the others.The new generations of both bulbs are indeed brighter and the pictures I took  make it easier to see the difference. You basically get to compare the glare from each housing. In person you can see the difference side by side but its hard to see a difference if you see them on without any comparison. These are excellent LEDs but unless you need the brightest available I wouldn't order these as a replacement if your current previous generation ones are fine. If you don't have the previous generation already then yes - I would order these newer ones.These LEDs have a t10 base so they will fit into the socket for many applications (168, 192, 194, 912, 921, etc..) and if you have room above the base you can use these there. I have a bunch of 921 LEDs in my 3rd brake light and also in the headlight as a DRL. Even with the headlights on you can easily see the LED above it. They won't fit everywhere though.My car doesn't have any bulb out warnings or CANBUS but previously with the previous generation bulb when reverse was not selected the LEDs would be dimly lit and would flicker. I installed a resistor to fix it but I also could have just wired in a small incandescent 192 bulb. Evidently even when they are off there is still a little bit of voltage getting to the LEDs. It was never a problem with incandescent bulbs but the LEDs can lightly glow with small amounts of power. I happened to have some resistors or I would have just used a 192 in a socket behind the light. Either way works.I received these for free for the purposes of reviewing and evaluating in an honest and unbiased manner.

Sealed, new item had black soot-like material on the inner surface of plastic packaging, and left the same on hands after handling.  I will be returning it.  Either there is poor quality control, or the manufacturers are using junk material to create the filter.  Don't waste your time.

I bought this to help with a water pump and timing belt change. This tool is a must have! It fit snug and did its job! The water pump Installed perfectly on my 03 Odyssey with 197k miles. I chose not to purchase the kit and save a hundred bucks because my pulleys and tensioner seemed to be in excellent shape. Replaced the timing belt as well, even though the old one seemed to be in good repair anyways. I tossed the gasket on the water pump and used the "Right Stuff" gasket maker instead. I also replaced plugs.Suggestions:-Buy THIS crank pulley tool (It will make your life easier and you won't risk damaging your engine).- Take out spark plugs when adjusting cams.- Buy thread lock for crankshaft pulley bolt- Buy thread anti-seize for plugs.- After belt install, turn crankshaft pulley "righty- tighty" two times around and ensure you still have TDC.- Use Walmart cheap Brake Cleaner to clean up area after disassembly.- Watch lots of videos on YouTube to understand lining up cams to TDC.***CLEAN EGR PORTS in the intake manifold.I completed the water pump and timing belt job. I also replaced spark plugs since I had to remove them to turn the cams to TDC. The old NGK laser plugs were nasty too. I assumed after putting in new plugs, new pump, and new belt, this puppy would purr (The vehicle ran ok before I started  this job. The only reason I was changing the water pump is because I noticed coolant on my A/C compressor while doing my last oil change).I fired up the can for the fist time and the idle seemed to be ok, but I could hear the all to common tap coming from the rear valve cover area. This is usually just the solinoid, but it did appear to be a little louder than usual. No check engine lights were on, and while I was driving the car around there were no signs of any problems.I thought the tapping was just the car trying to readjust to the new parts, oil, and plugs I installed. However, after driving about 50 miles, the idle got worse, and shortly after, my engine light and tcs light came on at the same time. The tapping was really loud now, and I was afraid I had damaged something in my cam shaft when adjusting timing. I pulled codes and had P0300, P0302, P305, P306, and P1399. Although the vehicle performance when driving was still good, I had no clue what happened. After reading several posts and watching videos, I decided to check and see if I had a bad coil or spark plug since plugs were loosely packed and out of package upon arrival from Amazon. I simply unplugged the coils to see which ones didn't effect the engine when unplugged. Of course the middle cylinders 2 and 5 were hard to tell because they are in the middle and don't really shake the engine as much as the end cylinders do(I bet many people misdiagnose this and commonly purchase two new coils and plugs which were not really the problem). It was hard for me to tell if the engine was missing or not on 2 and 5 because the idle was so bad in the first place. I even listened with a stethoscope, and heard weird metal clanking noises and tapping in the rear valve cover. I finally went to the next easiest check, and that was to unscrew and check the intake manifold cover. Super simple and took literally 2 minutes to pull off. I was SHOCKED at what I saw. I always use Chevron Gas, or have Techron additive available when I don't have a choice. I know this keeps my fuel system clean, but when I pulled the cover, it was a black carbon mess. My EGR ports were almost completely blocked. My engine was suffocating, and I had no idea. I spent an hour cleaning, scraping, vacuuming, and wiping carbon off the manifold.I put the cleaned cover and gasket back on, and the car sounds like it did when we first purchased it. I still need to do a valve adjustment at some point, but for now, I'm leaving it alone. I hope she is good for another 100k miles.I also switched to synthetic Mobile1 0w20 and Fram Synthetic Filter. I will try to get 6k before next oil change. I have always done the Fram HM and Valvoline HM non synthetic.

So functional! I got this for my bike when I was doing a street-fighter conversion, having to remove the original cluster and replace it with other gauges.The Good: It works. It's that simple. It's very functional, it tells you the temperature of the coolant. Boom. Simple.The Bad: Sometimes the needle vibrates when you are idling. It's fine when you are riding. But other than that, it's a very functional gauge.Conclusion: Get it if you don't have a temperature gauge, your gauge is broken or you just need this for some reason. It works great, I've been using it for over 3 months with zero issues.

I put these in my wife's 535i and I don't think it looks bad at all. Fits good. It looks a lot better than French fries and croissant crumbs down the side of the seats. If you're passing stuff to the kids behind you, this is a must. I'll be happy I bought these the next time I fumble the phone or key FOB. Probably buy a pair for my truck now.

Folks be *VERY CLEAR* - although Bosch advertises (including on the package itself) that ICONs have a "universal adapter" that fits "all wiper arm" with "easy installation!" . . . the Bosch ICON blades are *not compatible* with 19mm 'top lock' wiper arms.  Their informational videos purport that to be the case, but after a week of trying - including (embarrassingly because I've changed wipers on countless cars) going back to auto parts store to have the guys there attempt to attach the ICON blades to my Top Lock arms - they were utterly flummoxed as well. Of note, the package itself contains no instructions whatsoever.  None.  Nada.  Zip.  Nuthin'.The ICONS will not work with Top Lock arms.  Period.  Unless you use a welding torch or duct tape.  Unfortunately with 'open package' the blades couldn't be returned to the store and I'm sitting on $75 for two blades that are worthless.

********** (10)THIS CAMERA WORKES AWESOME  .  I  PREVIOUSLY  bought an Esky camera and it quit shortly after  I began to use it.THIS CAMERA works great day or night and gives me excellent field of view. It is also less bulky than the esky one I had and does not cover the license plate month or  year sticker on Missouri plates.BTW :I'm not saying all esky cameras are  bad, just the one that I bought was. And I already modified it to fit my plates so I could not return it. Will include a pic of the Esky camera if you're curious. Glad I chose to try this new one. All smiles.

The bumper itself looks awesome on my Jeep and seems very well made. Everything lined up perfect and fit well, lights transferred easily and overall install was very easy. My only complaint is that it arrived with a scratch on each corner from shipping. The factory does wrap it well with bubble wrap, foam pads and empty boxes for cushion...but they can't control the shipping company...so I still have 5 stars. I will update after my winch arrives.

Installed this on a ZX14R and it's nice and loud.  I put the amp in the tool box under the seat. I wired it with an relay so it would be instant on when I turn in the bike.  I can hear it at under 70mph. At 70 it's a little hard to hear because of the closed helmet and wind noise.

Mine was genuine Toyota as pictured, not like some others were complaining about. Not sure what happened there. Also, return through amazon was seamless as usual.However, despite amazon advising me this would fit my 2013 RAV4, it did not. It has four hooks, two for each side. On the right side, I was able to hook up both but on the left side in my Rav4, there was no top hook because of the JBL subwoofer.I'm not sure if all Limited's come with the JBL or just some, so I can't say it won't work on all Limiteds, but it certainly is not usable if you have the sub.I'm giving it a 3 because it was genuine Toyota and I'm sure it would work great ... in someone else's car.

I don't really have anything to compare this product with because this was my first time ever trying wraps or decals. The first try was rough due to the learning curve. I simply peeled it off and these pics are of my second attempt with a slightly different approach.I've read some of these reviews and it sounds more like irritation due to lack of skill and less like a flawed product. Let me offer a few tips..It's waterproof and the backing absorbs water. Dampen it. Heat gun shrinks inside corners and stretches outside corners, so feather it with the heat gun while it is hovering.. not after it's stuck down. It is somewhat thin.. so don't stretch it as hard as you can with a fingertip or pull really hard while blowing a heat gun on it.I doubt professionals would do it quite the same, but I did wet it first. It is exactly like tinting a window, but harder. It is not the easiest project to do at all. It takes more than looking at a few pics and deciding you want it. You still have to do it, and it takes the right touch.I give 4 stars, rather than 5, because there are a few brands out there with key features that (after trial and error) I now realize may have offered a significant amount of convenience in comparison.Regardless, I'm sure anyone that has already done this a few times would be perfectly capable of wrapping anything with this product.I will most likely be ordering more since its half the price of competitors and I now have some experience with this particular brand. It's all on the installer. The product itself is sufficiently rugged, does NOT tear or rip without first applying heat.. and it arrived on time in pristine condition.Edit: Decided to try out a more difficult piece. The wrap also does good on vinyl.. both hard and cushioned.

I bought this set because my car has a slightly warped rotor and I decided to upgrade my front braking abilities.  I bought a set for my wife's vehicle a few months ago and she loves them.  I'm sure I will love the set and will post pics during and after install.  Right now its too cold and not pressing.  Will update review later.  Parts look correct though. Looking forward to installing the product soon,  maybe the next week.

Please be aware of my experience when buying this radiator. When I received the radiator it was not secure in the box. When I picked up the box I could tell the radiator was moving around in the box and there were rips in the side of the box. When I opened the box there were a couple of small pieces of foam that were supposed to be holding the radiator in the box and they were moving around so basically nothing was supporting the radiator in the box. This was the most poorly packaged thing I have ever seen. As fragile as a radiator is and it was not even being supported in the box. You would think the manufacturer would have put a long piece of foam on the bottom to support it. I have purchased $10 toasters that had more support in the box than this radiator. Quite honestly, I will be quite shocked if this radiator is not already cracked. Some of the fins were already bent from being bounced around in the box but I guess that is a minor thing.

I don't usually like to order product from Amazon that isn't fulfilled by Amazon, but based on the reviews I wanted to try this light. I liked the ratings and specs, and it was the size I wanted with the illuminated rocker switch like I preferred. The product came in a timely manner, and was packaged sufficiently to protect the light from all of the hardware. The instructions are sufficient for anyone that knows what they are doing, but might leave some mechanically illiterate wondering what to do. I purchased this kit for a 2010 Polaris RZR S. The wire harness was BARELY long enough for the way I routed it. Barely is perfect for me, but worth noting for anyone looking at this kit. If you have a 4 seater UTV it might require some extra length, or some creative routing to get all the way to power. Upon opening the box, one of the first things I noticed was the fact that the included mounts will not mount backwards like the product page claims they will. I am not using them that way, so again does not affect me, but is worth noting for anyone hoping they can mount them reversed. Mounting mine to my roll cage, I ordered some different mounts than what came with the light. I've seen others ask the length from mount to mount, so I thought I would clarify that. Again I did not mount mine with these mounts, but when they are installed on the light it measures 34" from mounting hole to mounting hole. The LED lens is 30", the outside housing of the light is just over 32", and the mount holes is 34". The very outside of the mounts is going to be closer to 35". Keep this in mind when choosing your mounting location.The wiring seems to be quality. Crimping on the ends to the light didn't crimp very well, so I soldered those connections just to be sure. All of the other ends and connectors are already installed on the harness. I suggest measuring your switch with a digital caliper, then drawing a template on paper. Cut that out and use it when you cut your hole in your dash (or wherever you are mounting your switch.) The switch installed easily once my hole size was correct. For those that don't fully understand the wiring of the switch, I would suggest taking a picture of the wiring on the back of the switch before you unplug it all to install the switch. Then you can put it back correctly. I struggled getting the switch to illuminate. It would activate the relay and turn on the light bar just fine, but the switch wouldn't light up. Turns out I had a bad ground on the switch ground. Once I isolated that, the switch lit up bright and perfectly every time. Just a little hint if anyone else is having the same problem.For anyone needing help with the wiring harness, I would suggest getting help from someone that knows what they are doing. If you don't like asking for help, google or youtube how to install an LED light bar with a relay. There is some very informative stuff out there. But in short, the positive and negative connections by the Relay go to your main source of power (the battery is your best bet), and the positive and negative connections by the switch go to your power for the switch. In my case I wanted them on "keyed power", meaning I only wanted the light to work when the RZR was turned on. Some want them to turn on even if their vehicle is turned off, so that is up to you. My accessory outlet on my RZR only powers on when the key is turned on, so I tapped into the positive and negative behind the accessory outlet. That way there is only power to my switch when the RZR key is turned on. That way if my kid is goofing around in my RZR he won't turn the light on and kill my battery without me knowing it. Use a multimeter if you are unsure if your chosen power is keyed or not.Overall I am very pleased with this light bar so far. Time will tell of its durability, and I need to do some night rides to really get an idea of how bright it is. I'll update this review if there is anything negative worth mentioning.

Bought this to light my 50 inch LED light bar. Hooked it up and it work for about 5 min. They used too small gauge of power wire to the light bar so the wire burned up and melted the relay. They used a thick enough gauge wire to the battery but for some reason didn't feel the need to use this same gauge for the wires running to the light from the relay.

Much brighter than the stock Jeep JK reverse bulbs but, that's not saying much so, don't expect them to be like flood lights. I had hoped that these leds would be a bit brighter but, it's an improvement for sure.

Reasonably good product. Finish is easily scratched though. Did not come with link bars bit I was able to use the ones already on my truck. I have a 2003 f150 with the suicide doors. Had many responses tell me that the bars should match up right to the original brackets. They did not. I was able to use the front originals, but had to replace the backs. Pay attention to the other reviews staring that the brackets supplied are marked opposite if what they are. This is still the case. You would think by now they would have fixed that....

I have an 04 mazda 6 and the brackets mounted perfectly to my bumper support. The harness has plenty of slack to go anywhere I need it to. I've had the 32" led bar for a couple months now and it is much brighter than what I expected. This bar competes with the elite led bar brands for a fraction of the price. I am very happy with my purchase.

These do fit a 2015 dodge 1500 short bed, with some notable issues. You must remove the HEMI 5.7 liter badges from the front fender, and some plastic widgets from the wheel wells. I find it amusing that the instructions list this as "optional". The "option" is not to install them. You must be very careful when removing the HEMI badges, not to scratch the paint. Use a plastic scraper, adhesive remover, a soft cloth, and a steady hand. They do look good, and seem solid enough. The bolts in the pockets are for appearance only. You do not need to drill holes in the body. The installation takes...maybe an hour, using a phillips screwdriver, an 8mm socket, a small prybar, a plastic scraper, adhesive remover, and a soft cloth. Very simple.

Terrible LED lifetime, terrible corrosion resistance, terrible product.I installed two pairs of the 36W 6.5" flood lights onto the rear bumper of my truck less than 11 months ago, and I have not accumulated more than 10 minutes of use out of them.  Two of the four assemblies have one burned out LED each.  One of which failed to the point where it blackened the reflector in the housing and it looks terrible.  I disassembled it to see if i could clean it with isopropyl alcohol, and it would not come off at all.  LEDs should not fail this early.All four of the aluminum housings have oxidized very badly.  The paint is bubbling up and there is chalky corrosion coming from underneath.  These lights saw salted roads maybe 5 times since being installed last fall.I hope I still have the original bolts to put back in the bumper because I will be taking these lights off and buying a better product elsewhere.

I don't understand why anyone is drilling/screwing this insert in.  It is completely trapped by the plastic grille, and the plastic retaining clips that hold the grille in also hold in this insert.Do yourself a favor when installing tho... Definitely wear gloves.

I purchased and applied this paint 6 months ago and it is still looking fantastic. I used 2 cans of paint to refinish a used set of Brembo calipers to like new for installation onto my car. Very happy with how the paint sprayed, leveled and cured The instructions state for maximum hardness and chemical resistance the paint should be baked after initial air drying and I did bake them in an old oven. The fumes generated were not bad, although you're wife isn't going to like it regardless!I cleaned all four calipers thoroughly, sanded them with red Scotchbrite pads, wiped down with prep solvent, masked, hung and sprayed each caliper. I did both rears at one time then both fronts. Calipers were as disassembled as possible although I left the pistons/seals alone and just carefully masked them. I reassembled each calipers with all new pads, hardware and completed when with new white decals before installing them on the car.I would really encourage anyone going through the effort to remove the calipers from the car to paint them. There is no way to get full coverage as installed on the vehicle and overspray on the rotor and suspension components is unsightly.6 months/6,000mi of mixed daily driver / highway hellion use later the finish still looks every bit as good as it did when new. High gloss luster has not diminished, and the color is still vibrant.There are assorted small chips in the finish from what I assume is road debris strikes. Nothing evident to the eye unless you take a knee and really example the calipers.

I purchased the Silver Stainless Steel Center Console CD Player switch covers to go on my 08 wrangler. In the pictures they looked pretty good. Now that I got them in, they really just seem kind of cheesy but not in a bad way.They do fit on the knobs. The back has a small piece of double sided tape that you peel off the paper and stick on. They are holding well and have not fallen off yet, even though the inside of the car reaches about 120 during the day right now (southeast US). I was hoping they would cover the outside piece completely and wrap around a bit but there is a bit of a gap. It is not bad though. The wrangler has  a chrome ring with the very front being black plastic. There is a little gap of black showing through so if you are wanting them to completely cover that and be all chrome, you may be disappointed.The packaging was not much but I did not expect it to be. Both covers came in a small plastic baggy. That was placed in a bubble envelope. For as small and light as it is, this provided plenty of protection.I do not expect to encounter any problems with these, as there is nothing that will actually break. If anything, the tape will stop holding and it will fall off, or maybe get scratched up.

I just purchased my third tube of this stuff. It is absolutely fantastic. I will never buy spray again.The down sides is that it takes a "long time" to apply correctly. But what bike owner doesn't mind drinking beer and working on their bike?The other, super minor in my opinion, is that some of it does fling off initially after a new lube job and wipes clean from the rim. Then it never flies off again.The other awesome side to this stuff is that it lasts forever once on the chain.It is hard to find in bike shops so stock up here.Any questions, just ask!And please click "helpful" below if this review was. Thanks and happy riding.

Update: 11/26/17 - Stopped working this summer and the bulb isn't serviceable. I ended up buying some 1260 lumen LED backup bulbs instead. Much happier with those so far.Works great!  I will be buying more for Christmas gifts for my family members.  Fits snugly in the 7-pin connector and stays in even travelling across fields and gravel roads.  I have put over 1000 miles on with mine plugged in.I used it while hunting and it worked great for setting field decoys when set to Utility.The pictures were taken backing into my garage that is 28 feet deep.  One picture is with the standard backup lights the other is with the Blazer back-up light added.

Overall very pleased with the light...Arrived quickly and packaged very nicely.  I am leaving the rating as 4/5 stars until I see how it holds up in wet weather.  I did follow others comments and check every Allen bolt (front and sides) just to ensure a good seal, and only found a couple that needed a very slight turn.  This thing is crazy bright...I mounted it to the hood of my JKU with the Rough Country brackets and everything fit perfectly.  A couple of noteworthy items:- Unlike other LED bars I have mounted for friends, this unit came with the power/ground cables pre-terminated with insulated paddle connections.  This was great since I was replacing a pair of Hella 700s with this bar which used the same connections, so all I had to do was plug it in.- The side mounting bolts' (2) Allen head is the same Torx bit size as a majority of the other Jeep bolts, so simplifying the amount of tools needed is a plus in my book.  I was nervous about how two bolts would hold the light steady, but once I had it tightened down on the mounts, it is very strong and unmovable.

Had to trim to fit. Test fitting has to be done prior and during trimming process. After about 2 hrs the doors fit good.

i use these everyday and this is my 3rd opt7 hid kit. customer service is great. cant beat the price since it also comes with a relay and capacitors. i made my own projectors and had to save money somewhere, saw this hid kit and went with it having previously bought from opt7 before. some people have issues but i didn't have any issues and they started right up. Got them a month ago and have used every night, no issues. Will update if anything happens.

**UPDATE**12,000 Miles after installation one of the orange o rings has failed. All of the orange o-rings looked like they were about ready to fail. There's nothing like being stranded on a road trip over a 10 cent part. I do believe that metal elbows are the way to go but I would definitely stay away from the Dorman ones though. If I had to do this again I would try the APDTY ones&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/APD-58176IQ-Coolant-Fittings-Tubes-Elbows-For-Intake-Manifold-To-Belt-Tensioner-Upgraded-Aluminum-Design-Fits-Select-1995-2008-Buick-Chevrolet-Oldsmobile-Pontiac-See-Description/dp/B00DGWAJDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">APD-58176IQ Coolant Fittings/Tubes/Elbows For Intake Manifold To Belt Tensioner Upgraded Aluminum Design Fits Select 1995-2008 Buick / Chevrolet / Oldsmobile / Pontiac (See Description)</a>&nbsp;or the ACDelco ones&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ACDelco-91051-20-Professional-Accessory-Belt-Drive-System-Hardware-Short-Metal-Elbow/dp/B00S0CX2L4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ACDelco 91051-20 Professional Accessory Belt Drive System Hardware Short Metal Elbow</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ACDelco-91051-19-Professional-Accessory-Belt-Drive-System-Hardware-Long-Metal-Elbow/dp/B00S0CWXS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ACDelco 91051-19 Professional Accessory Belt Drive System Hardware  Long Metal Elbow</a>&nbsp;or replace the o rings with some GM ones.

Allow yourself at least 3-4 hours to get this done. It took me about 3 hours to sew it on. There was no instructions included with it, just the cover, and two sets of needle and thread. It did end up looking really well, I just wish there was instructions to save me the trouble of having to spend time actually figuring out how to properly sew it on, the stitch pattern that is. The end result however was a lovely steering wheel that looks like it came with the car that way.

I am giving a four star for now (it deserves a five but it needs to earn it), as it brand new by less than a month (and so far, so perfect) but I will report back in six months to update.  Meanwhile, a sub $300 price for anything that covers the passenger area (almost perfectly water tight btw) through a winter is pretty amazing.  To also have it look like it might last multiple seasons surely justifies any "risk" in buying this rather than many tops at two, three times the price.  I have lots of other places/interests to spend my hard earned money on what is basically another toy/hobby. That said, if you need a top because your Jeep is both pleasure and needed/mandatory for commuting, I can't see any reason to pay more unless security, vandalism and break-in's are an issue, then no soft top can prevent that and you are going to be out $1100 or so for a hard top.  Otherwise, the tinted windows gives an added measure of no peeking security...and I imagine this top will repair just as easily as any soft top with a seam split (or blade cut) by using a big needle, tough thread and a tube of black chalking/seam repair glue.Buy this top. I did not receive any special discounts or pricing to do this review.You cannot do better in terms of price, performance, fit or appearance in my humble opinion.  I really like the fastback or frame-less style.  Drops the visual height of the vehicle and gives it a slightly squatted down appearance. I am a six footer and easily another two-three inches of height for driver and my head touches the top in the back but not uncomfortable for any short stretch passenger (who the heck is in the back seat for hours at a time anyway?  That is what a hardtop or a car is for!) The Sail Cloth version is absolutely high quality material given the ridiculously low price point.  I will use the top during the winter and switch back to our full bikini and tonneau (and windscreen when stormy) set-up in the spring, summer and Fall. This frameless is such a perrfect  alternative to a hardtop (which we have but I just don't need it/like it as it changes the character of the vehicle.  I get hardtops but in our case it is a backup/fun truck and not an everyday driver.  Anyway, switching tops will preserve the frameless top a few more seasons then what already looks to be material and workmanship that will last at least a three to four years of constant use with a little bit of care and careful install and removal thoughtfulness.  I base the opinion on how well our current rampage tops have manged this past year.  Yes, they are slightly discolored/faded but other than that the seams are good, the clasps/plastic tracks, edges are all in good condition and after they are unpacked from their storage box this spring they will get a protective coat of Topps or other dressing and off to another season of dust, dirt and open air motoring.  Cheap, quality and durable.Installation:Installed sail cloth version on a 2004 Rubicon with the sound bar.  Tight, impressive, precision fit requiring a little bit of patience (especially lining up and carefully doing the final zipping of the side and rear windows) but it can all be done by one person (use a stool or short ladder to gain better leverage and positioning) and allow about an hour to pre-heat the top, rear and side windows and another hour for the initial install and learning curve, and best waiting between sequences to provide some additional thermal stretching time in mild 60-70 degree weather.  Time and patience really do matter on this install. If you are in truly cold weather you had better have a warm garage as I can not imagine fully installing the top without doing some serious damage to the top (zipper's and fitting the lower window plastic edging without something splitting/tearing.  All in all a perfect fit. Followed exacting advice of others in this forum as well as watched the couple You Tube Rampage install clips.The BowsMy top came with hollow metal tubes ("bows") crimped at each end rather then the fiberglass rods referenced in the installation instructions which are to be used and installed directly over the passenger compartment to help in water runoff and less pooling during storms.  First, what is not made clear in the instruction (written or in the company video's) is whether the bows are best to install while the top is off the vehicle, loose or after everything is in place and a final procedural step.  Obviously, or logically (to me at least) was to install after installation of the top as in my case the top was tight enough without the rods initially installed. When I remove the top at the header I may try to install but it isn't critical or a major concern.  Just a minor flaw or instructional over-sight.  Once I figure out it will probably be one of those "doy's!". Not a big deal, just a detail thing.The problem is getting the metal rods to deflect/bend enough into the end tabs sewn in the top without bending/splitting/breaking the rods or tearing the cloth insert tabs.  I chose to slip the rods in the front windshield side tabs only and then slide the opposite end of the rods between the top itself and the roll bar for now since I see only using when the Jeep is stationary for drainage rather than have them in while driving (as the top drums on them as you drive).  Small thing really.  I have a call in to customer service at "Rampage" but they (the new ownership) seems to be in transition and may be addressing this at a later date.  Tent-like fiberglass bows that had more "give" would make much more sense.  These rods, though since they are somewhat bendable in a permanent position may be as intended to create a greater "bow" effect in the top, but as it stands now you are guaranteed to permanently bend these at install and either prepare to unbend once inserted and/or allow a slight additional bow to customize your level of drainage needed.

Out of the box, light bar had one group of 6 flood LEDs that were dimmer than the other flood LEDs. Attached pictures show outer group of LEDs on left side visibly dimmer.  Paid extra for CREE LEDs  something wrong here.  With light bar lit, difference is easily visible. Will be working with Amazon /  Auxbeam customer service to resolve.

It is a night time installation as per images. It really fits perfectly my 06 Dodge Durango 5.7L V8 SLT. Together in the pictures, i attached also CURT loaded ball mount. I didn't jack or lift my car, just parked over offroad sand, lower down and removed spare tyre, and remove foam that aligns to the U-Bolt attachment, U-bolt installation and then i went to garage for drilling another 2 bolts attachment through chassis metal bar, and done!  It took solid 1 hour from start to finish, and I'm very happy with my DIY results! Overall 5 start for CURT!

This is a great catalytic converter. Perfect fit for my 1999 Honda Accord LX 4cyl.This did come with the metal ring gasket and one normal gasket. Did not come with nuts/bolts/washers.I was able to pound out the studs on my old catalytic converter and use those.Pros: Job is very easy to do you self with very little tools. I already forgot the exact size sockets I used but I think it was a 14mm.  Perfect fit, was able to use the old heat shield as well. The old converter did have a hole for the bolts to go through on the heat shield but it fits snug and doesn't rattle.  This did make my check engine light go off! I did have to reset it by holding down on the milage reset button continuously while turning the ignition with the key into acc2 then starting the car. All while holding the reset button. Continue to hold the reset button until the light turns off. My light has still not come back on.  Price is great compared to other competitors and especially going to a shop and getting it done.Cons: I don't have any right now maybe that they didn't add two holes to the converter so the bolts for the heat shield would stick a little better on.In all it took me an hour and half to do this, that is with jacking the car up and everything. Also did an oil change while I was under there. I have noticed a slight change in performance, I think thats because mine was so old.In the second picture I took both gaskets out of the bags so i am not entirely sure that the gasket matches the part number on the bag. Sorry! Rookie mistake.

I believe this is a good product for the price. Bolts didn't line up the best but what do you expect. With a little mechanical know how it is an easy install. Definitely sounds better at WOT and idle. Also playing with the throttle while cruising is much more fun. Recommend a jet kit to go with :)

Much better quality and better looking than the Toyota mudflap. They are slightly shorter and wider which makes them look like they belong on the truck more than the Toyota flaps. You would need to replace both the front and back flaps to have a uniform look for your truck. If you're worried about losing the 4x4 logo on the back flaps, don't be. That is tacky and dated. These flaps are a good way to update your truck. You will need the proper tight space tools for this to be an easy job however.

I literally just received this a few hours ago, the light was slightly scratched that didn't really bother me, light is a little weak but it has enough light to get attention.MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS 'THE SUCTION CUPS'.I set this up and went on a Rescue call, before I got around my first corner the suction cups came off and the light began to blind me, after catching the light sliding back and forth on my dashboard I had to hold the light to the window by hand. Bracket is also flimsy.

Excellent replacement, bought this to replace handle relocated inside tailgate of a 2006 Silverado. What can I say it's OEM so it's going to work. It does come with the plastic rod retainers so it's a complete replacement. You will still need to get a cover if yours is broken. I recommend OEM as well for that.

NOT a good fitting for my 2006 camry 2.4L auto, just look at the picture the hole doesn't even line up not even close........the part is extremely CHEAP, generic black painted, like most said 6-8 months life span. LUCKY? ONE year.......I seen one at wally for $13.99 looks and feel much better......update: TIPS do NOT take out the bolts from the bracket, just use a small pry bar to push it forward and hold tight while barely getting the bolts back in place by hand tighten and then tighten it back up with your socket set. OVER ALL usable.

Nice kit, super easy install, takes almost a minute!Only so-so part is the chain anchors fit pretty loosely in the truck mounting points, not so loose as to be any kind of safety issue but maybe a noise issue. Guess for something like this they have to have fairly loose tolerances. I may try and work out some sort of cushioning for the anchors to alleviate this.

Shakes a little, but if you angle them about 45 degrees in instead or 90 degrees straight out and then adjust mirror to desire location it helps with the shaking some. Also tighten top jam nut up onto the non threaded part of the rod and then tighten bottom nut on the hinge and it makes for a more solid rod and reduces shake as well. They are a must with doors off.

Over 1000 miles on this tire now. I have both front and rear. No issues so far and seems like very little tread wear. I originally had only the rear tire installed since I was waiting on the front one. Used it brand new in heavy rain, no traction issues at all. 160 pound rider.

These are amazing LEDs, I am extremely impressed. I am using them in place of my 4114k bulbs as day time running lights in my 2004 Chevy Suburban. The attached picture shows the LED on the passenger side and stock on the drivers side. Also I have smoked lenses with black reflection, on a standard housing they are much brighter. I plan on updating my turn signals next.UPDATE:  Aug 15 2016. One quit working, Then 5 days later the other quit working

Most (current) vehicles include a towing eye (lug hook) that screws into a threaded hole behind a plastic cover on the front/back bumpers (photos).  I purchased this 3/4" D-ring (screw-pin) shackle to attach a recovery strap to that towing eye. The D-Ring shackle screw-pin is approximately 3/4" diameter (size is the diameter of the shackle and not necessarily the pin diameter although they are typical close) and fits through the eye of the automobile bumper towing hook which are typically 1" diameter and greater in my experience. This particular shackle is made of carbon steel and has a Zinc coating for rust prevention. It has the required ASME B30.26 markings (Important) which tell you the Working Load Limit (WLL), in this case 4-3/4 Ton (9,500 lbs.) and the shackle size 3/4". it has the letters "CE" which are the abbreviation of French phrase "Conformit Europene" which literally means "European Conformity".It should have the manufacture symbol...so, not sure the manufacture of these but probably not the USA. If you need a larger WLL go with an alloy steel shackle instead of carbon steel. Bigger is not necessarily stronger, it is also the material properties of the steel used to manufacture the shackle that determines working load limit. This $13 carbon steel shackle has more than enough capacity for my intended needs...

Love it!Nothing complicated about the design of these face masks. They seem to be basically a piece of athletic t-shirt material.The only thing that I found a little annoying is that it can be a lil difficult to find the sweet spot where the mask is pulled up far enough but not touching your eyes or in your eyes.With that said, I prefer to use these over a dust mask hands down.I use them for doing demo projects with interior construction and when I mow grass.Of the other brands I have purchased, this seems to be the best compromise of quality of and price.I highly recommend this brand.I liked them so much that I bought several.Don't waste your time buying the SA brand as they are much more expensive and no better.

Used on my LV Pochette Meis. Application was SO scary! I freaked out for a moment since I could see tiny dots of the spray BUT don't worry it fades! I watched several videos and had practiced several times. After roughly 30 min, its fades and I wore it the other day when it started sprinkling outside, and it did not ruin the Leather on my Pochette Metis.

My oil filled gauge broke, again,  spilling oil, just like the last two. The price was right on this and not needing as much range as my supercharged days. I installed this unit using Teflon tape,a few threads above base thread. Sealed perfectly and read the same as my previous gauge. My Mallory pump 1/2" lines can go into the 20# range and Holly type needle and seats blow when over pressured. I keep it on one of the feed ports on the return style regulator at 6.5 psi. My engine tried and true, healthy 383 in an old 240Z, messy old school,but no guesswork, reliable for more than 15 years in current configuration. Pressure matters. Gauge looks good, easy enough to read, and matches my old. Exactly what I need when checking under hood pressures.

Anker really did a great job with this PowerCore Jump Starter. It comes in a very sturdy case that holds the jumper along with all the accessories. The bottom of the case holds the 600 amp portable charger while the top part holds all the accessories for the jumper. The included accessories include the battery terminal connectors, a 15v 1 amp wall charger, a 15v .8 amp car charger and a micro USB cable. The jumper turns on by a flick of a switch which are near the 2 USB ports on the side. It includes a LCD display to show the status of the battery so you don't have to guesstimate if the charger has a charge or not. It also has a LED light with multiple functions you can choose by holding down the circle button near the USB ports. The LED has 3 different settings ranging from steady, SOS and flash. On the other side is a rubber flap those covers the ports where you would connect the battery terminal connector. The battery terminal connector is quite easy to use. It even has a status light that would flash either red or green letting you know there's a problem with the connection or jumper.The previous version of the jumper was only capable of 400 amps and only had 1 USB port. 200 amps later, they added another USB. The battery total is rated at 15000mah which would charge your phones/tablets multiple times. Each USB ports capable of charging up to 2.1 amps each (4.2 amps total) and with the help of their IQ charging technology, its capable of delivering the fastest speeds (up to 2.1 amps) to your device.While you could leave this in your car for whenever you might need it, Anker suggests that you charge it back up every 4 months to make sure it will deliver at the time when you really need it. Overall I really like this portable jumper. It has multiple uses which makes it a much sweeter deal. Somewhere deep inside I wish they you could charge it through USB, but then again that would probably take ages to charge using USB's maximum 2.4 amps at 5 volts. Fortunately I have not been able to use this at its full extent (jumping a car), but this will be in my glove box for when that time comes.Anker sent me this sample free of charge in exchange for a fair and honest review.

Purchased this LED to replace the trunk lamp in a 2012 Mustang GT convertible.  I found the incandescent bulb to be brighter than this LED.  However, the purpose of replacing this bulb was not just an attempt to obtain a brighter light but to eliminate the heat the incandescent light produced.  A word of caution when removing a lamp that has been "on" shortly before you touch the lamp.  The bulb is VERY hot and will burn your fingers immediately. Also if you have the trunk lid up for a few minutes the circuit will cycle "off".  To get the bulb to illuminate again mash the trunk button on the key FOB or completely shut the trunk lid and then reopen it.  Before removing the rear plastic shroud I recommend obtaining replacements for the four plastic holding pins keeping the shroud attached to the metal.  The two top pins have plastic internal lips that act as a screw like affect on the metal attachment screws.  I found mine to be in poor shape with two of the four plastic "lips" not there and the pins did not tighten correctly.  These two top attachment caps are Ford Part Number W714997S300 - $1.39 each.  The two bottom push pins will undoubtedly self destruct when removed.  I purchased the bottom replacement pins with Ford Part Number W705589S - $1.94 each. The LED light seems to diffuse the light in the trunk better and is acceptable to me.  Just knowing the hot bulb (higher current draw) has been replaced is comforting.  Unfortunately I did not take a before picture but here are several "after" pictures.

Very nice top.It took about two hours for me to install this on my 2016 JK Unlimited Sport. Waited until the sun was beating down on the driveway so I could lay the top out and loosen it up a bit while I installed the doorsills and the brackets.The instructions were lacking somewhat- kind of hard to tell what step I was on until I found the actual page number in tiny print down at the bottom of the oddly stapled Xeroxed pages.Aside from that, I'm quite happy. The Jeep already looked mean. Now it looks even more misanthropic. Which is fine by me. I'm a grumpy old Navy veteran.As for function, if you're not in a hurry, the time it would take to put the side and rear windows back on are not too long. If you get caught in a pop up thunderstorm or a real frog choker, well... you might invent some new curse words unless you don't care how you get.Speaking of...It's supposed to rain tonight. I'll find out tomorrow morning just how water tight it is. If it leaks, I'll post an update. Otherwise...

I don't know how close this is to the original AMC blue, but for my purpose, it was great. I had to replace the valve cover gasket on the 4.0 in my Jeep. While the cover was off, I wanted to freshen it up a little, and bring in a little nostalgia.The paint has been holding up great. I applied a few coats of Seymour 16-831 light gray primer prior to painting and I think it turned out fantastic. A lot better than the boring black the valve cover used to be.

UPDATE!!! Soaked inside after a couple months and some bulbs burned out!!!!(Used to)Love the look and the light is super bright. The install was pretty easy.  I had to make two 5" brackets out of aluminum flat bar that mounted to my bumper mount bolts.  The brackets took me about 20 minutes to make. Everything bolted right up easily. Wiring wasn't too difficult, just positive and negetive connections. I ran the wire for the switch through a grommet in the fire wall on the driver side. I cut the plastic piece that was removed from the front of my truck to fill in the gaps on either side of the light bar. That took me a little while. Had to trim it to fit around the light brackets. Turned out pretty clean and looks tough. Hope the light holds up.

Seems sturdy enough. Gotta be careful after installing since these are very easy to cut by sharp edges. Tbolt clamps Are mandatory for these hoses.

I ordered Auxmart D-Ring Shackle 3/4" Black Heavy Duty 4.75 Ton for my Tow Strap it has smooth surface that will not harm my straps. It is designed to offer safe attachment points for straps instead of wrapping it around the ball on the hitch.

The item pictured is a Quality Brand Name tool with "PT" photo-shopped on to it. I returned this item since it was a light duty, Chinese/Korean made, cheap product. The LED lamp did not work on the unit either. I will spend the extra $$ and get the OTC 3650 now.

I didn't even know about this product a week ago but after hearing about it I decided to try it out. I was using a foam cannon by https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DKC6IY6/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_WE9lzbWEEEMVT, and used a gas pressure washer by Simpson. The car I was washing was extremely dirty, and hadn't been washed in several months, sitting in my driveway, and hasn't been detailed in quite a while. This was going to be a huge test! I rinsed the car off with the pressure washer, connected the foam cannon after inserting 2 ounces of this soap and 10 ounces of water. Proceeded to foam the entire vehicle. I then took a soft car wash brush to the vehicle and finally rinsed it off. I then squeegeed the car. I have attached a video and pics for you to see. The only negative was the foam, in my opinion was a tad too runny for what I expected this to have. However after drying off the vehicle I was very impressed on the result. I didn't expect much of a shine due to the age and extreme filthiness and very little care this vehicle has had. This vehicle now actually had somewhat of a shine to it. It also looked very clean. The only part of the vehicle that didn't look too shiny was the hood but that would have been a miracle due to how bad it was on the first place. I don't know about using this as a weekly washer due to the price but on this occasion I was impressed with the outcome.

After looking for weeks on Amazon for a good winch, I finally decided on this one. I picked it for its overall value, warranty and Amazon reviews. This thing seems to be very well built, as it weighed just as much as the winch mount I placed it in. The wireless mode is awesome, I love not having to use the cord. As usual, shipping was fast and was not damaged one bit. Overall, I am completely satisfied!!!

Product installation instructions are written for "drive rivets" that use a hammer but I received mine with standard 1/4" pop rivets.  Not sure who is packing the rivets but either the rivets need to be changed or the instructions.

First off, these seat covers are universal, so your mileage may vary (pun intended) depending on the shape and size of your car seats. I knew before hand that these might not be a 100% perfect fit on my seats. They do fit well. A little baggy in the lumbar area and I don't feel like the velcro straps to keep the seat bottom in place are sufficient enough to keep the seat of the cover in place. The material used on the seat bottom and seat back is a synthetic leather type material and should be easy to clean. I haven't spilled on them yet, so i can't say for sure. I just used the front covers on my truck. I'm going to install the back seat covers on my other car to help protect the seats from dirty paws running around the back seat. Overall, I'm happy with them.I received this product for free or at a significant discount for my honest and unbiased review. All my reviews are my own personal opinion and I have not been influenced by the manufacturer or any third party to leave positive or dishonest reviews.

Easy installation.  On your Jeep JK just undo the supplied clip and use a butt splice connector (red in color) to each wire.  Black to black and (red from connector) to white on your Jeep.  It's plug and play after that.  The Halo I ran one wire from one side to the other and put both red wires into a butt splice connector and then a single wire to the fuse box.  I bought a bussman add a fuse and just plugged it into some empty fuse locations until I found one that was live when the vehicle was running.  They look amazing and you will not regret buying these.  Heatshrink on everything makes it look great.  The secret to crimping the butt splices is don't over squeeze on the crimp.  It breaks the wire.  Good luck!

I'm using this muffler on an LS1 swapped car with long tube headers to 3" y-pipe to Magnaflow 3" high-flow cat and finally this muffler. I absolutely LOVE the sound. Nice and throaty with ZERO drone. Higher in the RPM wakes the neighbors but keep off the loud pedal and its "I won't get pulled over" quiet.

These socket bars are made to last! And for the price you can't beat them, these are a lifetime tool and I foresee many years of use from these. I like the fact that I can buy extra 3/8" and 1/4" socket clips to put even more sockets on a bar, and I did. They come with 16 clips to hold sockets which more then most others I've seen, and as I've said before they are built very robustly to handle the weight of a full bar of 1/2" deep well sockets. I've found that the sockets will stay on the clips to until I remove them, which was always a problem with my old push on clips without the ball socket. Remember guys and gals, you get what you pay for. And you can't go wrong with these socket bars! Would I buy them again and recommend them? You bet I would, and I will be buying more. For anybody that that turns a ratchet, these are the perfect gift or a great addition to your toolbox!! Thank you Olsa!!

The cost was good.  Still not worth it.  The bristles came terribly deformed and a mess.  When you brush them with your fingers some kind of dust was coming out of them.  The one is deformed and not straight at all.Best of all, one had a hunk of plastic wedged inside.  Just get the Oxo brushes instead for scrubbing.  These bristles, even if they had came straight and plastic free, I feel would be a little too soft for scrubbing and a little too hard for delicate work.For a similar sized brush, get the Oxo Grout brush.

Upon first look when I opened the fenders from the packaging they looked great! I've heard horror stories of similar fenders from other companies arriving and the finish was chipped off and dinged up but these fenders were perfect! Install was easy took about 2.5 hrs. To make sure your install goes smoothly try to get a rivnut setter! All in all I'm very happy with the fenders and the look great and feel very sturdy!

I love these spotlights. They fit perfectly on my jeep. They're easy to mount and are very bright. Personally I like this better than the traditional round fog lights. They were cheap but are very good quality! I'd say go for it if you're looking for a good set of fog lights.

It seems like VViViD is the way to go when buying vinyl. Its great if you have a small project or decal you're making and don't need anything fancy like 3M, Oracel, etc...So far I have used it on a front grill of my car and it has stood up to the weather in San Diego. Which is mainly a lot of sun lol, but also good in rain and car washes, so the adhesive is strong. Also made a small decal on the sides and those have more detail to them but also stay on when scrubbing the car during a wash.

makes the lights look unique.  Kinda of a pain to install if you've never done it.  On stock 94 Accord lights there are knobby points on the lights that made it challenging to say the least.  I love the way it looks.  Gave it 4 stars only because the install difficulty.  Do recommend youtubing how to do it.P.S. looks nice with LED lights.

In California, we don't get to wash our cars much anymore. Regardless of your opinions about the drought and its causes, severity, or tenurethat ship sailed and were here, in a drought. You might imagine the bittersweet surprise when Federicos Car Care sent me a pair of chenille microfiber wash mitts to compliment the microfiber polish cloths 5 pack I reviewed right here not too long ago. So lets fill a bucket of soapy water and get right too it, shall we?On a hot but not too sunny day in SoCal I filled a bucket with soapy water and set to work. It grabbed and held the sudsy water and cleaned the old truck like a dream! When I was done I washed and rinsed it and set it out to dry in the sun, and when it dried gave it a shake to find the nap of the chenille was just as fluffy and plush as when it was new! Nice! Its also 100% machine washable, too.Microfiber is a natural fit for a car wash mitt, with it being extra absorbent and its tendency to wick up dirt and grime and keep it away from your paint. It purports to be soft and lint free, and at first, it very much was. By then end of our truck wash, little bitty orange fibers were clearly visible on the silver-grey paint. Truthfully, almost any cloth will leave some small bit of lint, but the bright orange color is going to make even the smallest fibers stand out. A minor knock on and otherwise great product!What I liked was it was plush and well made enough that it seems it could be used for quite a while before needing replacement. But, instead of hanging on to one (Remember, you get 2 to a box!) the other could easily be used to buff off wax or polish, or even for quick detailing sprays and kept in a trunk, console or glove box! Because it covers the entire hand, front and back, theres no worries about jewelry or nails scratching that oh-so-important clear coat, either! Want to use it dry as a duster inside the car? The fine nap of the fabric will grab and hold dust too! And like all Federicos Car Care products, they're backed with a 90-day, 100% Satisfaction Guarantee, so you can rest assured they will stand behind their products! And at $9.99 (shipped free via Amazon Prime), its tough to beat the value!I received the above product(s) free of charge from Federicos Car Care.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.

I purchased this battery pack for my own personal use in an off road truck in remote and lonely areas.Coming back from the middle of nowhere is a concern of mine and auto batteries have a way of dying in desert heat leaving my radios useless. Additionally I need a way to guarantee that the jumper pack will be charged and ready when needed and that is where this pack is awesome. Even if it is empty it can be charged by USB (most jumpers require 12V charging which is ironic) using a folding solar panel, many available for under $40. I used a 20w panel to charge this 12,000 mah battery, it took most of a sunny day and 11,870 mah (I use a USB power meter for optimal sun gathering). Discharging with an USB 2amp load netted 7,216 mah (voltage conversion and heat account for the loss see photo).I disconnected the 12V battery on my 4.0L Toyota to test starting power from zero. It started the engine, instantly with no drama, no heat, no smoke, 5 times in a row. I only stopped because I was satisfied and I didn't want additional stress on the batteries.A 20w solar panel, USB meter and this RoyPow Jumper make some good back country kit......and you get a cute compass.

Just wait til it's been on your car a few months. Worst product EVER! All but ruined tailgate paint. Nothing removed it but RUBBING COMPOUND, then you gotta wax it after that. Followed directions to a "t". Those who love it may have had better results after a few months. That's the key, as it initially seems to be okay. Wish we could get a refund, but it's too late and we have to spend hours trying to fix the damage it's done. Also, it doesn't seem to "set" right away. Still have black footprints in garage and driveway after stepping on running boards that were treated. Awful, just awful!

All my buddies with Warn Winches are now envious of me!!! After I told them what I paid for this Winch with genuine Amsteel Blue winch line from Viking. A bit heavier than a comparable Warn XD9000I, but that's mainly due to the fact this winch has an almost solid winch cable drum. Cause the brake is externally mounted and not in the drum, the drum and associate gears can be made thicker/stronger. Haven't used it much yet, but sure to see many good years of service from this exceptional product. Extremely glad I saved, and spent just a bit more and got this instead of the Smittybuilt XRC8 Pro with syn line.Install when using a standard Jeep winch plate was only just a bit tedious, only because there is no clearance between the bottom of bumper and the frame cross-member to get your finger's through to mount the front bolts on the winch. All else was dead simple.Highly recommend this winch over just about every other one on the market. With the lone exceptions going to the Warn 8274, and Powerplant series.

The HD line is very good.  This is five stars because it works and it leaves a phenomenal finish.  That said, it is not very aggressive. That can be a very good thing, but if you are looking to remove a lot of material or some deep scratches - this is not for you.  Go with something a little more aggressive than this.  The below pics were with this product followed by HD Speed.

Got this for my Toyota FJ Cruiser 4x4 TRD.I had BF Goodrich mud terrain t/a 265 75 16 which is $250 each. Going mud terrain to all terrain was like night and day. My BF Goodrich did great job on off road but it just performed miserably on the road(where 99% of my drivings are).Installed at local Sams Club(lifetime rotation/balance) and drove 900 mile roadtrip for Christmas vacation.I'm loving this tire.Hankook is significantly quieter, softer, cheaper, and kept same aggressive look on my truck.I did extensive research before getting this tire.I was deciding between General Grabber AT2(265/70/16), Nitto Grappler(265/70/16), and Hankook Dynapro(265/75/16).Those three were the top choices I made while searching for all terrain with aggressive look.Hankook was cheapest($20 cheaper per tire), had good/most reviews, and also kept stock OEM size. Other two tires also had good reviews but there were not that many reviews out there.Hankook advertise their Dynapro ATM has wider 6-7% footprint and I believe it. It looks bigger and wider than my previous tire.So do I miss my BF Goodrich? Hell no.I paid only half the cost of BF Goodrich with same aggressive look and softer/quieter ride.I don't think I'll even try other two I had on the list when this tire wears out in couple years.I'll also recommend this tire to my dad's Tundra.

These are excellent. I replaced the backlights in the radio of my 1999 Volvo V70. The result is fantastic. After I replaced the four burned out bulbs, I took a photo (attached) to compare how the new bulbs were working compared to the one remaining original bulb.I wish these were available in amber and green as well.

I purchased 4 of these from another site and one here on Amazon.  I have these in the 8x170 on a 2000 Excursion.  I have to say that these are by far the most terrible wheels I have ever owned.  First of all, the center caps are very cheap plastic.  Then installed, they do not sit tight and rattle around as the wheels spin.  At the time of my purchase, no where did it state that these wheels require a 60 degree lug nut.  The for factory lug nuts will not work on these.  The first set of lugs nuts I ordered were the pro comp spline nuts that were supposed to come with a socket and valve stems in a pack of 32.  They arrived with just 23 thrown loose in a box, no stems and no socket.So back to the crappy wheels.  The finish on these were mediocre at best.  They had a decent shine, but also alot of polishing scuffs.  Within 2 weeks on the truck, they are completely pitted.  The picture of the wheel is actually taken after I tried to polish them.  The pits will require sanding and polishing.  There is no way I am going to sand and polish these wheels every two weeks.  This was by far the worst purchase I have ever made.  Between these wheels, the lug nuts and a lift kit, I will never in my life give Pro Comp another dime!!!

Excellent product.  This is an affordable front suspension upgrade for a 2016 Toyota Camry SE with automatic transmission.  Per other reviews, the orientation of the bar was flip flopped coming out-of-the-box, though this does not affect performance.  This allowed for improved handling and steering response.  The bar was relatively easy to install.  Although, you'll need a LOT of elbow grease to remove the 6 bolts on the strut tower (3 on each side), and to tighten them all up after.  Definitely best to have a longer breaker bar for this purpose.  I would highly recommend this upgrade, since the 2016 Camry does not come stock with a front upper strut bar.  And no it's NOT just for looks, according to other reviews.  I'll even go as far as to say that when accelerating from a dead stop, the traction response is improved.  What are you waiting for?  Buy it already!

Update 10/4/16I should have updated this long ago but forgot. As far as my gap issue, I flipped the lights around and the problem was fixed. At the time of purchase there were no instructions and the pictures on Xprite's website also showed the lights upside down. Have now had the lights 5 months and are working great. Customer service goes above and beyond to make sure the customer is happy.*****************************************************************************************************I might be over critical of this aftermarket product, especially for what I paid, being that the alternative (JW Speaker tail light) would cost $300. The lights were very easy to install (true plug and play) and did not need load resistors (to fix hyper flash for turn signal). When braking during the day (no lights on), only the outter LED's light up (see pic 1) and I don't feel like they are all that bright or obvious. Although the brake lights do not stand out all that much during the day, the side of the light has 2 additional LED's and a reflector and these 2 little lights are super bright, but I don't know how well the car behind me can see these during the day.At night when you have your lights on (pic 2), it looks better and the entire panel lights up when you brake (pic 3). I wish the entire panel lit up this way during the day too. Pic 4 shows what it looks like when you have your lights on, foot ON brake, and vehicle in reverse. This brings me to the reason I deducted a star. Lets just say that my stock reverse lights were way brighter than the LED reverse lights. The reverse LED's are so dim, for a second I thought they were not working.The other thing costing this product a star is that I noticed a slight gap between the top of the light and my jeep. Nothing noticeable unless you get really really close, but big enough that it worries me what can happen when I wash my jeep or if I'm in heavy rain. I plan on playing around with the light fixture and will attempt to adjust them and see if I can get a seal on there. If so, I'll update this and add a star. For the most part I'm happy with the lights.

So far, so good. I just received it and put it on. The front is labeled which is nice. I do believe it's breathable because it's very soft and I'm not sure how it would do in the rain. Our Jeep YJ stays in the barn, so while it is subject to wind and dust, it won't be in the rain or beaten by the sun on a daily basis.I'm not entirely sure how it would do in the elements, I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't last for a terribly long time. However for my application, I'm happy with my purchase considering the price. It's also very easy to put on.On either side there are 2 elastic straps the clip under the body. Since my wrangler has a step on the side, the cover doesn't sit flat on the door. Could be a problem with wind or heavy rain (or in my case, mice).There are also 2 straps on the back, but they appear to be meant to wrap around the tail lights (they're not elastic and don't have a hook in the end). The only time I could see this being an issue is if you have removed your stock tail lights and opted for the flush mounted round ones. Otherwise it seems to work fine.

So far we love these lights. They are cool to the touch and have a nice white color.  They do not come with instructions. People my be unaware that L.E.D. bulbs heve to be inserted in the socket with the proper polarity. Meaning if you insert the L.E.D. bulb and it doesn't work, remove it and rotate it 180 the other way and then they will work.

I installed this manifold on my 2000 F-150 5.4 Triton motor back in October 2017...I wanted to get at least 2000 miles on the truck before doing a review...Still running good with no complaints...Just make sure to clean up your gasket surface and torque to specs in the pattern given...This manifold comes with O`ring type gaskets installed into the new manifold body...The traditional gaskets used at the factory are not needed for this installation...There will be lots of dirt and debris around the intake openings when you lift the old manifold off...Be careful not to let debris fall into the intake chambers...Put clean rags into the openings to keep dirt out...Keep a vaccum attachment handy to suck up dirt and debris...If you are also doing plugs blow out the plug cavities before pulling the plugs because dirt and oil will fall into the combustion chamber...Also make sure to install your O`ring on the vacuum line "elbow" that turns and snaps into place included with the manifold...While you are doing this job and you are well over 80,000 miles it is best to replace other parts like the spark plugs and fuel injector O`rings ...Do the injector O` rings regardless...I also replaced the individual spark plug coils since I have about 100,000 miles on them...While apart, clean your throttle body with throttle body cleaner...Here are some photos from the job...I also show close up manifold damage that caused the coolant leak in the first place...They always fail in this spot...I learned how to do this job from Youtube...This job is for an "experienced" guy or girl who has wrenched on their car on a normal basis...Took me a few days going at a careful pace doing the job right the first time...

One of the TOP RATED reviews said he did the job in 3 hours also stating he wasn't a mechanic...I don't even think a master Tech could do it in 3 hours if they are doing it right...As I stated above, If you are a weekend mechanic, it will take you the better part of 2 days to do it right...

I would give 5 stars if it wasn't for the shipping of this product. Even though it says Prime shipping, which is free 2 day shipping, I didn't receive my product for 5 days. When I looked at the UPS shipping order, it was put down for 3 business days.One of the reasons I chose this product was because of the Prime shipping. I wanted to put these in over the weekend, but I had to do it Monday night after work when I was already exhausted. This is false advertising by the seller!Now the product:Good quality, fit well in my Hyundai Elantra. There is a smell, but I hope it will go away soon. The front seats were easy to install, back seat not so much. I would definitely recommend watching the installation video.

I love these hubcups! I only get compliments for my new "rims"!!!I had a bit of trouble installing them because I couldn't realize which wire setting to use for my car, I guess there isn't a way to tell unless you test it, I started by using the "medium" wire setting then realized they are way too tight, I guess would be good for smaller wheels, but using the larger setting they fit perfectly! Very pleased with the purchase!

Great little seat for working on projects low to the ground.  Wired this arcade machine from under the control panels using this chair.  Would have been really difficult without it. The trays work great for holding parts as well.

This tape is great!  I wrapped my STI intercooler and aside from it looking great, it helps prevent my intercooler from becoming heat soaked.  I have performed this install in the winter so I haven't had a chance to test it in the summer, I will update my review but I strongly recommend this product. I didn't have any trouble with the tape sticking to anything (intercooler or AC tubing), although I cleaned all the surfaces before taping.7/31/16 Update: underhood temps are night an day difference.  to be fair, I did this upgrade at the same time as a a turbo blanket and a larger hood scoop, so I can't compare how much difference was from just the tape, but I no longer feel like i'm losing power in the summer. It's a cheap upgrade with noticeable difference, I can touch my intercooler after aggressive driving or autocross, I couldn't do that before.

Bought this to keep cold wind from hitting me in the chest on cold mornings. Seems to work fine for that. Im 6'0" and with the puig installed sound is no more no less IF im sitting up straight, however, if im slumping then the noise does increase. If you are shorter then this could be an issue.It looks really good on the bike. I really didn't want to add a taller windscreen. Thought it was only for old guys, but i must say it looks pretty killer. The dark smoke is darnn near black so if thats not what you want go lighter. Darker than the picture in the amazon listing.Another thing to know is that it does make contact with brake fluid reservoir at full lock right turn, but just barely, not a deal breaker at all but let it be known. I added two pictures to show stock compared to puig. also of hitting reservoir. hope they help.Dont hesitate to buy this windscreen especially considering the price. It is quality and looks great. Enjoy!!

I really like how light weight and easy this is to set up. I remove it after every camping trip since I may need the bed of the truck for something else. The only issue I had, and I am sure I did something wrong, was I damaged the bed of the truck on a tight turn around at a campground. I am certain I set the ball height per the instructions but it was still too low and in that tight turn the kingpin box hit the top bed rail. I studied the set up after the damage and raised mine up 2 more spots to make sure this never happens again.

This is my 2nd edit as I realized I was duped.. 3 different spots above you will see that they mention 4000k, which is pretty white... funny, as right on the back side of the packaging, that they don't show you above, they clearly shows their meter showing 3600k!Bulbs themselves do not have the blue tint over the whole body as shown in pics, just a light banding of blue toward the tips that is buried into the metal bulb tip housing area of my cars' headlights anyway. If you look closer at all the pics they showing varying levels of blue tint on the bulbs so YMMV. This blue tinting is not intended to make the light "blue" but at least more white, and mine lack this.Kind of wish I just got some $10-15 cheapies at this point, not sure it's worth the hassle of returning as they are definitely at least less brown than stock bulbs and do seem to work fine with slight increase of visual clarity down the road... When you see the 5 Philips levels of performance, they seem maybe 2 steps better/whiter than stock, like a middle of the 5 options, but definitely not like you would expect for the very highest level available.

This is hands down the best spray detailer. I only use ice products on my cars. I used the black box kit but still prefer the ICE product line. Truly amazing. All this stuff you read about it not adhering evenly is because the paint surface wasn't prepped before hand with proper waxing. I even use it on my guitars to keep them looking good.

These are an excellent product. You can shake the entire vehicle with these handles. The install was a bit confusing at first as to which spacer went where but it quickly becomes apparent. These is recessed printing on the grips that say "WILD BOAR". I would order them again if ever needed and would definitely recommend them. I ordered them in black for my 2015 JKU Hardrocker (fitting as SDSM&T alumni).

These bulbs are awesome!I started out with some cheapos from eBay... They were a $12 lesson because they sucked. Within 2 weeks, one of them stopped working.So far, these are great - you can really see and feel the difference in build quality. They are extremely bright and light the ground well. They appear to be ~6000k - 6500k in temperature, so just slightly blue.You will most likely regret not getting these. Don't be tempted by the cheap ones... they will let you down. :(

This was a very affordable and great set of wheel spacers for my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ). I needed to pull the wheels away from the body just a little bit to stop some light rubbing with 31" tires that are wider then stock. They seem very well made and fit on the hub perfectly. They were also the perfect thickness to clear the hub stubs so wheels with fully flat mounting surfaces (no open areas for the studs) can be used.No more rubbing and gave my Jeep a nice wider stance! I have put about 500 miles on them and have no issues at all.

Sticks perfectly well looks great, could not be more satisfied. Wrapping in general is pretty  difficult, which is why a lot of people tend to mess up doing it, but the end result is so worth it. I recently finished wrapping my car, I messed up so many times but I did successfully wrap some things. Might order more to finish the job.

Rears 171281 look very different from each other. One box is shorter by an inch and is smaller side by side by 1/2 an inch square. Bar code and tags are identical on the box. Inspecting the smaller strut I notice big differences. Top plate is slightly smaller, Spring has only 7 turns not 9. Top quieting wrap is missing, Metal top seat cap for bumper is missing flange, Bumper is entirely a different shape and color, The boot appears to be an aftermarket split boot, Total spring height is 1/2 inch lower, Tube below spring is 1/2 longer. The caution/ Date code sticker is missing and the shock bushing is painted over while the other one is not. Their is also a metal stamp in the tube 71281E of the shorter one that is not on the other strut. Monroe says the date stamp is from 2011. The bottom of the shock tube weld beed has been ground flat. The Red Monroe Warning sticker has a slightly smaller font. I purchased all 4 from AMAZON LLC. They will replace the wonky one put what ended up in a Genuine Monroe box with Monroe labels. What was I sold and how did it happen? I will update when resolved

This is the oil wrench tool I have been waiting for. I previously have always either used my hands, (awful, always difficult, and you tear your hands up when the filter is in a tight spot) or the old style oil filter wrench removers that are "one size fits all" and have a long cheap rubber handle handle with a flimsy 'metal' circle on one end (those only work so well; if the filter is in a weird spot it's hard to get leverage, if the filter is a smaller one the wrench won't tighten all the way, overall still not a great solution to a very common problem).Enter the Motivx Tools Oil Filter Wrench!This thing is solid. When you pick it up, it's got some weight to it. It's made well, it doesn't look like some cheap filter wrench that will break after the third use. It's made to snap into a standard 3/8" rachet. I tried it with my cheapo harbor freight rachet, it's perfect! It has a row of teeth on either side to grip oil filters with.The awesome thing about this is that if you have a car or motorcycle with an oil filter that is difficult to get to, you can use your rachet set and an extender and a swivel (either or) very easily. This is a lifesaver. I have a 2009 Jeep Wrangler, so my oil filter is already easy to get to. I really appreciate having this because it gives me ALOT more leverage to get the filter off. Let's face it, sometimes those tech's at the shops don't know what "hand tight" is and you need the extra leverage. This takes the fight right out of getting the filter.CONS: The only con I see is that this will not fit HUGE oil filters. The diamaters it fits are clearly listed from 2.5"-3.25", so just make sure your filter is within that range and you'll be very happy with this product.I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review,

This was a direct replacement for the oil filter in my 2012 Honda CRF450R.  It fits fine.  It is made in Korea, appears to be well constructed, and it has more pleating (therefore a greater amount of filtering media).  My bike hasn't exploded, so I assume the filter is doing its job.

Fits perfectly in my 2006 Odyssey without any modification.  Time will reveal the quality of this part, but the original obviously wasn't perfect either.  A 14mm crows foot and extension works well for removal of the nut at the far end of the hose from underneath the vehicle. You can find a few videos on YouTube for this.

The added storage on the tail is a great addition to my Sportster.

The lens is plastic/polymer and appears strong, the ends where the wire comes out has some type of clear compound to seal but I don't think its weather proof.  As described each end has a set of wires but you only need to run power to one side to make the light work. The hardware (brackets & screws) is metal and fit perfectly on the fixture, if you place the brackets toward the end you don't block any of the light.To illustrate the brightness I made a temporary hook up so I can understand placement, in fact the light is surprisingly bright for its size. You can see from the video the light is bright enough by itself, the light is actually brighter than the video shows, but based on your need you may need additional lights if you're trying to throw the light more than 5 feet or so.My plan is to use this as an under the hood light for my sons car, based on the throw of the light I will mount it a little off-center and it will be more than enough light to check the oil, coolant and washer fluid.  I purchased this item at a discount in return for my honest review.

I am a wax junkie.  I have pinnacle, Adams, surf city, meguires, P21s, chemical guys, mothers, turtle, 3M, Wolfgang, etc..lol. You get the picture. I own a 2008 Ford Mustang GT/CS convertible.  I love my car but the clear coat is not the best.  I am constantly waxing and detailing my car.  I have found that most of these waxes do the job. P21s would be the best out of all of them.  I have not bought any of the waxes that are super expensive.  This meguires M26 Mirror Glaze yellow wax does the job and is less expensive than most of the others.  Wax your car when it is cold and out of the sun. I didn't wait too long to wipe it off.  It wasn't that hard to buff out.  I did take car to avoid the plastic trim. This wax reminds me a little like the P21s.  It wouldn't hurt to have this in your wax arsenal.

Simply the best rv toilet out there. The porcelain bowl and wood seat are just like home. Add the spray option for easy cleaning (after all this is a gravity flush and doesnt have that big tank to wash the bowl with each flush). Remember, get the low profile if yours sits on a raised platform like mine and the standard height of it mounts directly on the floor.

Installed on a boat trailer really easily with some 3/16 rivets, and heat-shrinking connectors & liquid electrical tape.  The first day I launched the boat, the light ended up taking on water.  It popped two fuses in my truck and never worked again.  Revisit your design; it's not waterproof.The photo shows the water level when the light is tipped ~ 30 degrees.  The water is somehow sealed within the reflector - I can't get it out.

I installed this on a 2007 pontiac vibe base model. Here's what you need to know. The manifold itself is a quality part, aside from the design not allowing you to get a socket/torque wrench on the center nut. The support bracket on the underside is not correct and only allows one of two mounting holes to be used. The gasket on the head side is good. The donut gasket at the catalytic converter is too big. It doesn't allow for a tight seal and leaks A LOT. To make this work on a vibe you need to throw away the donut gaskets and order an oem toyota donut gasket. There are 2 supplied in the kit and the one that fits on the manifold is too large to seal correctly on the catalytic converter. Once I installed the oem gasket and springs /bolts, the leak went away. This part number should not be listed for a pontiac vibe. They need to make another kit available with the correct parts. This leak issue ended up costing me three time what I would've paid if the kit came with the correct parts.

I used a pair of these wheels to replace the old ones on my wheelbarrow. I finally got tired of pumping up flat tires in zero degree weather. I also had to replace the shaft, since my old one was a 1" shaft, but I can't imagine ever trying to haul anything that would exceed the weight limit of a 3/4" steel rod. These roll smoother and straighter than the original wheels did when I had first bought it.Knowing they work that well, I may just get a couple more and restore a couple of our older wheelbarrows.

Arrived in brand-new condition.  Looks great, fits great.  Used to install a double-din head unit (Pioneer 720BT) in my 07 Altima.  Using factory radio brackets and no modification there is a small gap along the top but it isn't noticeable and I could tweak it if I wanted to.  Overall it is a million times nicer looking than using the Metra dash kit I purchased previously!  Take care when removing the AC vents above the radio as the dash material around them is fairly delicate.

These go on fine, but my lock socket stripped into one of the lugs while trying to remove them. I had to take my Jeep to Discount Tire to have them remove the lock lugs with a special lock removal socket just to get them off and it took them over an hour to do it and they were only able to get 2 of the 5 off.  The inside of the lock socket is defective. I'll post pics when I get back home.  Also, I re-ordered these because I couldn't find a shop to get the other 3 off and they changed the design so now I'm F'd. Good job McGard. You should at least have a link to sell the replacement key but even on your website it's the new design.

Spot on, as exact fit as you can possibly get from plastic molds. Just laid right in top of the carpet floor mat, no issue. Teeth on the bottom gripped well, didn't need to lock into place. They will more than likely fit better once they have had time to lay down and mold to the exact floor board.This fits both bench and bucket seats. Bucket seats require a little trim, so easy, it's a predetermined line. All that's required is a simple box cutter of any kindRecommend for sure.

Clean the area well and get it close and flush as possible before screwing all screws in place. Very happy with the product. Can't beat OEM fitment.

Bought this because it is sold by the waterheater manufacturer. It DOES NOT have the hole in the switch for the lock-out pin. That SHOULD be an obvious characteristic for the manufacturer, but alias they are a clueless bunch. As others have mentioned it stopped moving, so I expected to find it had melted internally, but ... I didn't get that far. One of the wires had melted off the back, and was difficult to find and fish out of the hole. Its insulation had melted back as well as disconnecting from the clearly-not-well-crimped connector. Clearly the clueless twits don't understand bimetallic corrosion, corrosive resistance, high-current, and heat. As far as I am concerned they should lose their UL listing because they are shipping an uncontrolled electrical heat source adjacent to a propane valve. Since the only point of that switch is mechanical/electrical lockout after winterization, lacking the lock-out pin hole makes it questionable if the right thing to do is put in this switch, or just wire around it to avoid future corrosion issues.

Absolutely possible for the weekender to complete all four shocks in less than a day using common hand tools and a spring compressor. I like the option to adust the ride height, but once installed it's difficult to adjust so figure it out ahead of time. I used a 1.5" lift in the rear and the highest setting in the front  and it turned out great. Remember you need to get an alignment afterwards, and depending on how much you change the ride height the caster may not be adjustable to within tolerance. This is normal and expected and shouldn't cause any pulls or tire wear if you have a competent alignment technician. Don't forget to adjust your headlights.

Perfect fit! Came with all necessary hardware. Way cheaper than the dealer brand and I've put it through its paces. This is a great product.

I am in the New Mexico area and all the reviews about the antenna making the reception worse scared me a little because I primarily listen to the radio BUT mine is waaaay better than the stock antenna! I was shocked! I love it! Gives the jeep a cool look and amazing sound!! Would totally recommend!

This is probably about as good as any other you will find so at least the price was good.  I purchased it more for the night shade due to my increased problem with seeing well at night.  However, after purchasing it, I realized that my biggest problem was looking beside and behind me in changing lanes so this won't really help with that.  I may try some of the night driving glasses instead.One thing I don't like about it is that the sun shade part is way too dark.  I could never drive with this down.  However, even though the sun shade part is unusable for it's intended purpose, it is still good for a passenger.  Also, it is good for when the sun is coming down through the side window on the driver.  Just flip your visor down like you usually do and then open this up.  That will help a lot.Even though it won't help me as car lights coming at me don't bother me, I do want to say that I experimented with it and it does seem to filter out the glare and make it more manageable.  I will try to post a photo of it at night when I am able.For those complaining about it not being deep enough because you are short, don't attach it to the "back" of your car visor.  Attach it to the front.  Then it extends your car visor instead of replacing it.  I'm short so that's what I do.

Sadly I have to give a 2 star review on the rear grab bars. I've had the fronts for a few weeks and they are great.  The fronts are hands down, a 5 star product. However, these rears are not near as good. For starters, the finish is ok. Not absolutely horrible, but not perfect. My biggest gripe is that the holes where the screws go and the heads of the screws themselves is the same size. This means when you go to tighten them up, the screw goes completely through the grab bar. You either have to use a washer or find a screw with a bigger head. See picture. Other than this, they are solid and I will use them.

I wanted some genuine sheepskin covers for my car. Genuine sheepskin covers for my front seats cost $300 for universal to $600 for taylor made. I got a chance to try out the Leader Accessories lowback sheepskin cover at a discounted price, so I jumped on it. I measured my seat first and the bottom seat was the exact size but the back was 2" shorter than recommended. The back fit nice and snug, although there was a little extra at the top. There is a velcro area at the top to put the headrest on. I oped to not use the included headrest cover.The straps for the bottom cushion keep the cover in place, but I found that they spandex for the straps was a little too long for my liking. It would have also been nice if there were a couple more straps to ensure all around coverage of the seat.I was a little disappointed that the pocket on the back did not have a leather style edging like in the photos. There is also another clever little pocket in the front of the seat, between where your legs go. I would have prefered a solid sheepskin cover rather than the multi panel design because on the seat, you can clearly see a big gap between the panels of sheepskin. Maybe it will even out with repeated use.It's important to know that these are not 100% genuine sheepskin. The front is real sheepskin, but the sides and back of the covers are a synthetic fur. "Muppet fur" as one reviewer referred to it. Its easier to see the difference in material in person.I installed the single cover on my passenger seat because there is an armrest attached to my driver seat which will require some modification and disassembly of the seat to get it to fit perfectly. Overall, for not spending $600 on custom tailored sheepskin covers, this is a nice budget friendly alternative.I received this product for free or at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. My review is my own personal opinion and I have not been influenced by the manufacturer or any third party to leave a positive or dishonest review.

1 year of use, still good, Installed these on a trailer project and did video " Double Axle Trailer Build from Salvaged RV frame Pt. 4 The Emma 1 " you'll have to search for that one,Very low power draw after also installing 16 total on a 34 foot travel trailer. Pulls less than half the amps the old lights used. Very dramatic appearance upgrade too.Only fault I can see is the wire gauge is SO SMALL its hard to get a permanent connection.

This is way too small for a reg car or truck. More for a little tiny sport car. I also put in on my Lexus RX300 and there was about 4 or 5 inches uncovered top and bottom and a few inches on the sides of the front window not covered. The top of it flips over in the wind, so... not good. I would say go for a better brand. I know it is cheap, but really doesn't work. The point is to get something that works, right?One more note: That band or loop of elastic is only on one side. Found no use for it.

I was off on a 3,000 road trip to mining territory and visit family in Sierras, Nevada, Idaho, Yellowstone, Grand Tetons, back down the middle of no-where Nevada, June Lake CA, then home. I wanted a fridge for backup food and water. After some in depth research, I chose ARB.  A perfect choice.  I have a truck with a tonneau cover. This was just under the cover, so nice fit. I plugged into the 120V outlet in the bed of the truck. Yes, if you have a 120 V utility outlet, it will work fine. I bought the fridge cover as added insulating and padding. I did not bolt it onto the pullout tray. If you put this on a rubber mat, it will not slide around. If you have a tonneau, it can't even fall over in a hard turn as the cover prevents the fridge from tilting. I went 4-wheelin and the fridge survived without issue. It cools down fast, but, you get better results if you don't put warm items in it at first. If planning your trip chill your water and food overnight in your regular fridge first, Then load up when ready to go. This way, goods are already cold and fridge stays cold immediately. Then as you drink and eat, replace supply. I included pic of my truck and you can see the fridge in the bed, but for these size trucks I would stay with this size fridge or smaller. I highly recommend the ARB fridge.

I can't explain how much I love this RV LED Light.  It is awesome.  It lights up the whole campsite and barely uses any battery power.  It did take me a few minutes to install, simply because hiding the wire is more difficult than I expected.  I mounted my underneath the rain gutter behind the awning, so even when the awning is extended the light is still against the side of my RV.  You could mount this anywhere you wish, this is just where I picked to mount it.  I also wired it directly to the existing outside door light.  Simple enough, but like I said hiding the wire across the 1/2 the light bar was tricky.  I ended up squeezing the wire above the included mounting bracket and then filling the tiny gap with silicon to hold the wire in place.I had no issues with the 3M tape that was included.  I did have to make sure when I removed the backing on the sticky tape, that I didn't pull the tape off the light as well.  Highly recommend and have recommended it to several people.

Product recommended by CanAm dealer for my FT3 Spyder (but they sold it for $15 more).  Cup holder was fairly easy to install; I did left hand side.  Three negatives - 1.  The paint flaked on the "mounting plate" at the "mounting stud bolt".  I bought some black nail polish today.  2.  The cup holder blocks the view from 1/2 of the rear view mirror from where I normally sit.  I just lean a little to the side to see the whole mirror.  I have a small stature.  You will probably sit differently on the bike and your view may not be obstructed.  3.  Using the thinest liner in the cup holder a soda can fits with a little clearance.  Something larger than a can probably won't fit.

The rubber inserts, the part that touches the windshield, kept coming out when the wiper wiped across the windshield. I would reposition the inserts, the same thing would happen. Tried another blade with new rubber insert, same thing. The rubber inserts are SUPER SOFT. There's no rigidity to the rubber at all. CHEAP CHEAP. Will never but Goodyear wipers again. Package says 'Engineered, Assembled,  and Packaged in USA with Foreign and Domestic Components'. I guess those rubber inserts are cheap Chinese components. STAY AWAY!

These say Genuine but they are not. I had the original GENUINE CAPS in which one was left behind at the Tire Store. The original caps by Nissan (shown side by side in my poor pictures) are PLASTIC (OEM P/N: #999MB-SX000) and go for around $12. These are definitely metal with chrome plating. Much heavier. Internally they have a small o-ring which wasn't placed very well. I've included the text that came with these. If you figure out what the four electrons are please let me know. I have replaced my "original bad valve cap" of which were 3 genuine OEM Nissan caps with these. Prior to installation I did put a little bit of "lubricant spray" inside to avoid any potential seizing like another customer encountered. Note, that these are comparable to the original but are metal. We will see how they hold up over time--I check my air every month or two so I'll keep an eye out for corrosion. I've given these 2 stars due to false advertising: They are NOT Genuine and are not Plastic. They do look okay otherwise.

pros:  black plastic looks good, doesn't seem delicate, mounts seem sturdy.  i weigh 230lbs and jumped around on it after installation without any issues.  looks pretty good on silver '16 sierra crew cab.cons:  pictures in instructions were not printed very well.  hard to tell what was going on.  took me about an hour of reading through the confusing language and pictures to figure out what i was doing.  once i got one side done, the other side was easy.

2 problems with this product1. the optional spacer (blue circle in picture) is whole, not split.  To use it, you need to split it with a knife.2. the clamps shipped with my kit were not like the ones in the picture.  I have replaced numerous CV joint boots and have never seen the type of clamp mine had (see picture I attached).  The only way I found to get the clamp to hold, was to use a screwdriver to hold the joint piece, then pull the end with a pair of pliers and then bend it back on itself, like other clamps.  The problem is that this clamp has no tabs to lock the end in place.  And the clamp itself is quite thin for the application.In general, the boot installed like it should.  The small end did not securely lock into the recess in the axle because I could not get the clamp tight enough.  I expect that it will quickly slide back from the recess.  However, it still should protect the CV joint better than what I had before, which was a missing boot.A few years ago, there seemed to be more brands of split boot on the market.  Now I could only find Dorman with a split boot.  If I was to use another Dorman product, I would buy better clamps.

Very nice with lid that snaps on, plus it has the traditional hold down strap. You will need some sort of cushioning to surround the battery, as these cases can not be an exact fit. See the gray round foam in attached picture.

I was having some issues with an HID kit that I purchased from OPT7. The Kit was just unreliable so I decided to upgrade to the Auxbeam F16. I upgraded both the Low and High beams on my 2010 GMC Sierra. Installation was pretty easy except for accessing the passenger side bulbs. It's a very tight fit so I had to remove the air box to gain acces. My hands are pretty big. Other than that, install was a breeze. If you have a hard time getting the bulb to line up correctly, giving the build a slight push will help. The rubber ring that comes with the headlight is slightly larger than the stock bulbs so you may have to use a bit more force.I paired these lights with the Auxbeam 9005/HB3 high beams as well.I will do another review in a few months after I've had a chance to use them a bit.

It is ok for the price...I did this job before on a 2000 Sienna. It went very smooth and the fit was great. Not with this one.The first thing I noticed is that the pin that holds the lock mechanism in place (See Pic1 red circle) did not have a C spring. So, I used the one from the original handle.Second thing is I noted is that provided plastic gasket did not fit the contour (See Pic2), so I trimmed it and held the gasket in place using pieces of painter tape.After fiddling and getting it to fit and fastening all screws, I noticed that there is a gap as between the gasket and the door panel (this had nothing to do with the tape since the gap was about 2-3mm). As mentioned in one of the reviews before I used some silicon (It is a 220K Miles van ;)

Replaced the original OEM pads on a 2013 Toyota Corolla (with 30k miles) only because I put on a new set of tires and wanted to compliment the better feel of the ride with new pads. That was a mistake on my part. Within 500 miles of installing these, here came the squeak - bad. The squeaking was EXCEPTIONALLY bad while reversing. I tolerated it for a couple thousand miles until the embarrassment at stop lights / signs became intolerable. When I went to replace them, I found that the coating - that negated the need for shims - was failing. It had separated from a lot of the pad (see pic),including where the caliper cylinder contacted the pad. Hoping to save money and not waste resources, I decided to throw on a liberal amount of brake quiet and re-install. It worked. The squeaking was gone. However, I shouldn't have to had gone through this headache with new brake pads. Luckily, I was able to return the pads I purchased at the local auto parts store. I now have 66k miles on the car and the squeaking hasn't returned.

This light bar is amazing.  I was expecting more flood than spot, but the combination with the 50 inch curve is perfect.  Turns night in to day around my Jeep.  Its beefy, and you can tell immediately upon handling it you have a good quality product.  I haven't tested the distance yet (the 20 inch Auxbeam I ordered for my lower bumper was to serve as my mid-range spot, with this being my mid-long range ambient lighting)...but the 20 inch didn't fair as well in the review as this one does.  (and my 20 inch came with Oslamp on it instead of Auxbeam)...I personally would like my light bars to match!  None the less, great product.  If you are on the fence, watch some of the youtube reviews comparing the Phillips bulbs in 50 inch bars to Cree and OSRAMS...you won't be disappointed.

Class 3 hitch from Curt for 2015 Jeep Latitude. Excellent hitch. They supply 6 bolt fish-wires to get all your bolts in place.  I did mine using a floor jack as my helper, jeep on ramps in the driveway*once your hitch is under the car you can rest it above the hanging muffler (unbolted and supported by the strap) and get ready to fit your first nut.DIY install. The how to video from Curt on "e-trailer" dot com is awesome. Watch it.What they don't show you is the hitch sticks out just enough to not let the chrome exhaust tips to be Reinstalled without some trim work. Not hard, if you used Tin-snips the trim the bumper use them again to trim the covers. Works easily. I'll post a pic.It is not challenging if you have the tools and some courage.You'll need;7mm, 8mm, 13mm and 22mm or standard equivalents.3", 6", and 10" extensions to reach different bolts.A  torque wrench (110 ft. Lbs) & an adjustable strap to hold muffler.Also the rectangle your going to cut for the hitch receiver is supposed to be3 1/4" which will leave 1/8th play on each side - I cut only 3" so it's tight, by 4 1/2" high.The fish wires supplied (x6) work so perfectly, but once laced through hitch you still have to take them off and VERY carefully install the nuts. Torque to 110.Took me 2 hours by myself - excellent hitch and way better to pay 121.00 free shipping vs. dealer at 500.00 + the hitch - yikes!1. Chrome exhaust tip trimmed2 the strap location.3 bolts with fish wires **pic shows top bolt in wrong hole - had to take it and reinstall4 taped, to trim sides and razor knife5 final receiver coming through bumper

This does exactly what it says it does.I actually had a R12 system that the pump froze up and blew out it's innards.  So after finding out how much it was going to cost me to have the shop put r12 ($80 bucks a pound plus labor and their parts) or convert it to 134a ( inferior cooling with high boiling temps and high head pressures and a major down grade) I decided to do this job myself.  I purchased the whole kit including the pump, dryer, oil, accumulator, and o-rings ($200) and picked up a cheap 134a gauge and vacuum set ($ 80) and some of this great stuff and waited for everything to arrive.  When I got it all together I used a flush kit from the auto store to flush out all the old oil.  (Mineral oil and Pag Oil don't mix) and it was important to get as much old stuff out.  I then used my air compressor to pump out all the flush till it was clean from both the evaporator and condenser (messy).  Don't try to flush a compressor or dryer, if have to open your system for any reason you need to change the dryer.I then put the new (Pag) oil (came with the compressor) in both the compressor (got to turn it a few times to let the oil work in) and a bit of it in the dryer and put it all together.  My system took 8oz of Pag oil.  Every vehicle has it's own amounts and you don't want to put to much or too little.  So if you have to replace the compressor, do your homework and find out how much it takes.After everything was put together I put on the gauges and vacuumed it all down.  My first try and I found one of my gaskets had folded and was leaking.  After fixing it I pulled the vacuum down to -30 and left it for about 1/2 hour and turned off the pump.  When I came back another 1/2 hour later it was still where I left it so I knew all was sealed and ready.I then relieved the vacuum (this is important) as you can not put this type of coolant in a vacuumed system.  If you do, it will not work right and you will over fill the system (VERY BAD).  Don't worry about letting in a bit of moisture when doing this.  This coolant does not get corrosive with moisture like R12 or 134a and it will not harm your system.  After making sure the system was at zero pressure I went ahead and hooked up the small gauge kit and let the first can go with the engine off.  After that can was done I started the engine and turned the AC on high.Keep in mind when your using a gauge, is that when you first hook it up with the engine off, it's going to show a much higher pressure until the compressor kicks in.  I then let the second can rip and the clutch kicked in.  My truck originally took 2.75lbs of R-12 and this stuff takes much less.  My conversion was about 2 1/2 cans (6oz each).  By this time the AC was starting to blow good and cold.  I hooked up the third can and slowly put about a 1/3 of that can in.  Take some time before putting in the last of your amount of coolant.  It takes a bit for the stuff to circulate and balance out.  If you don't you can easily add to much.After putting in the right amount of coolant the pressure gauge was showing about 40lbs pressure on the low side (never try to fill the high pressure side).Now for those with older R12 systems you want to be real careful here.  A normal R12 system requires about 60lbs of pressure but this stuff will stop cooling if you take it that high (I learned the hard way trust me).  My first time doing this I put almost 60 lbs in and it was too much and the AC stopped cooling due to too much coolant.  I ended up having to pull some back out and ended up pulling just a bit too much and ended up having to buy a new set of cans just for a 1/2 can worth.  Too much coolant will act the same as too little.  Except the difference is that you can kill a good pump fast with too much.The greatest thing about this stuff is that it works at clearly lower head pressures.  The difference is huge.  When I was running the R12 and the clutch cycled you could really feel it.  With r12a and it's lower head pressure (amount of pressure at the pump) it cycles and I can't even tell.  This means much less wear and tear on the whole system.Also for those of you with 134a systems it not only cools much better, but has a much lower boiling point so it's a double positive for you.So now my AC blows colder than it did with R12 and it will literately freeze me out if I use the recycle mode.Also for those who are intimidated by the idea of using a flammable gas for a refrigerant please note, This coolant actually takes a higher temp to burn than even 134a.  Don't fall for all the fear porn as I call it, trying to keep you from a great  AC system on the cheap.  They use this stuff in all the rest of the world and have for years and they don't have cars blowing up or catch on fire because of it.For all of those that got a working system already and simply want to (upgrade) to a less expensive better cooling coolant that is better for the environment than any (freon type) coolant you still need purge you system of the old coolant.  Get a shop to evacuate it for you, do your homework and find out how much coolant your vehicle needs and your ready to go.  I got a nice gauge unit with my first set of cans and it has a gauge to let me see the pressure.  Please note that if the shop evacuates your system, you might need a can of oil to put in also as coolant mixes with the oil.  You can get those here on amazon also.  Just remember, Pag and mineral oil don't mix so don't try to add Pag  oil to a R12 system.  But if your system had a leak and just bleed out the coolant your oil is still going to be in there so your safe on that.So there's my story, hope it helps you in your journey to cooler air : )

I would assume if I am buying AC Delco parts for my GM vehicle I would get USA made parts. Wrong! They are even stamped "made in China" If this were the case I could have just gone to the local "chain store" and bought them. They seem to be OK and they are definetely NOT like the one pictured which is coated. I will update my review after I put some miles on these.

Six of these plus 1/4" stainless steel bolts (at over 100,000 PSI pull strength, IIRC) spaced around my trailer give me more than enough room for tie-downs that make sense.Used them to transport a 900 lb military diesel generator recently and think they were a good investment.

Installed these on my '08 Ultra; man what a difference in sound, heat, and MPG. Install was easy (first time I've installed pipes); took me by myself about 3 hours. After the install, I updated the PC V to the proper map. Since the install I'm getting around 45 MPG. This definitely helped with the other mods I have (SE Stage 1 intake, slip-ons, PC V).

This light is extremely bright, everyone who sees it out on the trail always asks what brand it is. I've taken it through some hard core mud, branches and heavy duty rain storms! Unfortunately my light went out but fortunately enough the manufacturer responded quickly and sent me a new one at no cost . Couldn't be happier with the brand or the customer service I experienced.

Just installed these on a 2007 Toyota Corolla S and they worked great. I just purchased this car from a coworker who was the original owner. Car had 180,000 miles on it and it needed a little TLC. The brakes that were on it would cause the whole front end of the car to shake when applied. The steering wheel shook so bad you could barely hold it if you had to brake semi aggressively.These brakes took me several hours to install. Not because of them but because of me. I had never done brakes before but after watching a half dozen YouTube videos specific to my car I had the confidence to do them myself. The one thing that scared me the most was where to apply the brake lube at. I knew not to get it on the face of the pad but I was unsure where all to put it. Some people put it in some places and some didn't. If I had to do these brakes again I could probably do them in a half hour each now.I did follow the brake pad "bedding" procedure exactly as recommended after installing everything. I actually wrote it out on a 3" x 5" index card and taped it to the dash. Then waited until later in the evening when less cars would be on the road and went and got it done. Since being installed I have not had one squeak, rattle or shake. I will be purchasing these for all my cars from now on unless something changes down the road. All my cars are Toyotas and these are pretty easy to do. Especially in the age of YouTube where hopefully someone has already posted a video of how to do it.All the clips and rubber boots they gave me with the kit fit perfectly. I was unsure whether to wipe the new rotors down with a brake cleaner so I didn't do it. Some people on YouTube tell you to do it and some if you watch them just install them. Supposedly rotors will have some kind of coating on them from manufacturing that needs to be cleaned off. Since they didn't say to do it in their paperwork I didn't do it. So far I don't think it has affected the brakes in any way if there was a film on the rotors.I have deducted from 5 stars down to 4 stars for one thing and one thing only. One of the ears on one of the brake pads was slightly deformed in manufacturing and it took me 15 minutes to figure this out. Once I figured it out I was a little pissed. I kept trying to install the brake pad into the caliper clip and it wouldn't go. I kept trying to change the angle and anything else I could think of and it still wouldn't go. I had put a little brake lube on both ears and it had disguised the deformity so I couldn't figure out what was going on. Once I cleaned the lube off and looked at it I saw that the ear on the brake pad was wider then it was supposed to be so it wouldn't go into the caliper clip smoothly even with lube. I took a metal file and spent about 5 to 10 minutes slowly filing it down to make sure I took enough metal away to make it fit perfectly without taking away to much metal to where it would be sloppy loose. Luckily in one of the YouTube videos I had watched one of the guys in the video had said that this was a problem sometimes with new brake pads and manufacturing so I was somewhat keen to the situation. It just took me 15 minutes for the brain to engage.I have not had these brakes and rotors long enough to really give any long term feedback but I will come back in 6 months to give my updated thoughts if there are any. All in all these are so far great brakes and rotors.I'm posting a picture of the deformed brake pad ear and a picture of how the rotors looks behind my new rims on a 2007 Toyota Corolla S.

Nowhere on the packaging did it say ZANheadgear..this is a very thin. I had my 9 year old try it on and it fits him along with my 6 year old. I too have a smaller sized head and this was snug.

The product itself is awesome. Very simple and effective design. I cannot speak to its longevity as I installed it this weekend. Since installation, it's worked fantastically. The installation of the lock itself was easy into the tailgate, running the wires easy as well (always a pain) but the instructions were garbage and the color combos given (all 4 combos) didn't even exist in my harness. 2 minutes with a test light and I had it wired up. I chose to use wiretaps with removable connections as I marked the wires but couldn't remember which was which. I reversed them at first, then it was easy to reverse it with the taps I chose. Overall, I'm very happy with the product; hopefully, it holds up! I've attached pictures with the wires I utilized on my 03-2500Update - 5-25-18 - thing kinda sucks. Takes hitting unlock several times to work. It was intermittent but now it predictably fails every time to the point of embarrassment.

I see why the instructions tell you to 'mop up' the results after spraying it on. IT DISSOLVES AND REMOVES ALL THE CHALK! If you let the 'mud' go over the side it would be a mess on the paint. And, it doesn't take much. I rinsed off the roof first and started spraying the product. With just a few mop sweeps, it dissolved black marks, all the white chalk, instantly. Rinse off the mop, and go back and mop up the residue liquid. Brilliant white result. I rinsed the roof with a hose after and then the sides. 42' Coach and I used 1/4 of this bottle only.Went back with the Pro-Tec Cleaner, which seems more like soap, much more mild, then used the Pro-Tec sealer (it was cheaper than the Protect All sealer, but maybe the Protect sealer would be better also). A plus for Pro-Tac cleaner was it worked well removing the white streaks from the side paint quickly with a sponge or mop! I wouldn't do the same with this Protect All, might be too strong for the paint.

I was extremely impressed with the quality of this product. As others have stated, the paint and fit are flawless. I work for Ford Motor Company and I wanted an OEM piece. Unfortunately, Ford does not offer a one piece spoiler kit for this vehicle.  This one truly has an OEM appearance, and I would settle for nothing less. Installation of this product was quite simple, about a half hour. I choose to purchase 3M Extreme 1" double sided tape instead of using the included tape. I wanted to be sure the installation would be as secure as possible without drilling holes. I couldn't expect better than this!

Not crazy about the finish, but it does the job and remained tacky even after I botched up the install several times. It also returned to shape pretty well. I prefer the non glossy type I've purchased before that was not as stiff, but this did the job and actually loocks pretty good when completed.The amount I purchased was enough for two hoods.

So finally had the time to make my grips for my BP40CC. I used blue tape as a template for one half of the grip (use the poly mating lines) and then mirrored it for the other side, added a length that would wrap all the way around the finger side and half way back across the left grip. This would keep my fingers from catching the edge and causing premature lifting/peeling of the edge. If left at the finger area, right palm swell (left for lefties) or rear of the grip, your fingers and/or hand will constantly be rubbing on the seam and cause early lifting of the edge. Remember this as I feel its the second most common reason for early failure and why I don't really like the 'pre-cut' grip tapes.I then cut the shape with a scalpel as one continuous piece. Cleaned the grip and gun with a paper towel soaked in rubbing alcohol, then the grip area again, again with a clean paper towel, making absolutely sure to get it very clean in all the little dips and valleys in the stippling. This is probably the most important part and the #1 cause of a great many of failures. Get it CLEAN.I then slowly wrapped it around the grip, starting at the left finger center line, matching it to the contours and lines as I went. Use a hairdryer on Hot temp, Low air to make the tape a little more pliable and easier to manage. Only takes a couple of seconds of heat. Dont press down on the tape at this point, however, as you may need to reposition it. I ended up needing relief cuts at the top and bottom of the rear grip (butt). Just cut 2 shallow 'vees'. It would have pleated (folded) if I didnt, especially at the bottom, but that one was small enough that it closed back up.Once done, heat up the tape with the hairdryer and press it down firmly. I used about 20 seconds of heat per area, then did it again this time making sure it contoured to the front and rear stippling grooves with my finger nails. Just 'cause I liked it, not that you have too.I then cut out the thumb areas, again using blue tape, and applied those.See pics.Only been a few days, but I have more than a dozen draws on it, and so far its holding up. Feels good in the hand and definitely gives a better grip. Feel much more comfortable shooting now.edit: re-uploaded pics. Not sure where they went.

Thes are amazing tires! They are much quieter than I had expected...enough so that I kept trying to figure out what was different until I realized how quiet my car was driving down the road! These things provide amazing traction in the rain (my Corvette is a different vehicle now!) and offer great dry road performance! The ride is nice as well as quiet!

awesome little gauge, and it works perfect... I got it for my E350 6.0L powerstroke van, installing the transducer (sensor) was a royall pain in the A ss...  Just so you know in case you are planning to get this for a van like me, this is what I encounter: Had to disassemble the filter and intake pipe assy. had to disassemble the intercooler pipe going to the intake manifold elbow, and had to hold the engine harness with a barr all the time, just to access the auxiliary port on the side of the 2ndary fuel filter housing , and you are going to need this if you have a ford diesel truck or van (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DKM4PU?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00)  In a van, I don't recommend plugging the sensor straight into the fuel bowl cuz there won't clear with the intake temp sensor #2 that is right on front and IN the intake manifold, what I did, I went to napa and got made a hydraulic hose with the fittings that matched the threat of the sensor and the adapter (a 2f long) put the adapter in one end and the sensor at the other end... and even then, it was very... very... VERY... hard and tight to threat that adapter with hose to the side of the fuel bowl (now I know better, if I ever do this again in a van, I am going the "L" fitting and hose attached to the top of the fuel filter cap... this version works exactly the same, and it will save you hell on a van) ... you also are going to need at least 3 of this for a proper and save way to connect to power, the ground can go straight to any metal of the vehicle  (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K17A2E6?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00)  ... Also, get some YELLOW (yellow = fuel grade) teflon tape for the threats (don't use the white one on any fuel system) the other end of the hose with the sensor I re-routed it near where the power steering reservoir is, for my convenience and easy access, it is your choice where you put yours. Other than that, the gauge has a very good lighting on daylight and the dimming at night is good too, and the magnified glas is a plus in my opinion.Here are some pics. (ps: I don't care for looks of the gauge on my dash, I just got for practicality)hope this helped

Recieved Tenneco steering dampner, I think I would be more hesitant to buy this product if it was described as Tenneco instead of Monroe. The box says Monroe but the damper does not. I see other reviews stating they received the same product and its working out good? Not sure about the legitimacy of this item but ill apply the damper and give an update on the product. Also, the nut is seizing as stated by many other reviews so I applied some WD 40 on the nut and threading. Update soon to come.Edit/Update Dec 3rd. I did a bit of research and I believe this product is under Monroe or Monroe is under Tenneco but after installing the damper, my steering is much more stiff and firm. Big improvement from my old factory damper. You can also see in the pictute that it is much more beefier then the factory damper. Besides trying to get the rust off the old nuts, installation was smooth. Overall, I am satisfied with the product and can agree with other positive reviews. Boot was not included I had to buy separate. Installed on a 2001 jeep WJ Laredo

**Mine was missing hardware when it arrived. I purchased the quick release pin and a few other parts separately, and Amazon gave me a discount, so I will not let that effect my review otherwise, but its worth noting**Installation takes for ever. I'm a fairly competent weekend warrior mechanic, and this took me a couple hours to get the torque specs right, adjust, readjust, etc.. Directions are terrible (mine were torn). If you use common sense, they eventually become coherent.The idea behind this product is brilliant. Its one of just a few out there that will let your child ride his/her bike and then reconnect them when they get tired. I didn't want a Follow-Me product because they cant ride independently. Love the idea of this, but its a little on the cheap side and flimsy.Lots of folks complained about the part that connects to the child's bike frame coming lose and turning. I stuck anti-slip rubber pieces under and torqued to spec with a torque wrench and I didn't have any issues. However, I do have the leaning issue that many complain about. I've read that if you change the rotation of the seat post connection piece that should minimize or eliminate the lean. I have had little luck after readjusting a few times. I'll give it a go once more, but I think its just a matter of fact with these.Either way, both my 3 year old and 5 year old boys love riding behind me. We just took this on the Peddlers' Jamboree in Iowa (22 miles each way) and they had a blast. The lean is a little annoying and can make steering a little awkward for the parent. I hit the gravel a couple times because my kids were leaning back and forth (intentionally). They didn't complain about it being uncomfortable or annoying, but its there. Its less pronounced with the lighter child.Its quick and easy to switch from towing to independent riding. Just undo a few quick release pins and you can switch in 2 min flat. No problem and I'm impressed at how easy it is, and how well it stays put on my bike when not in use.With that said, we're keeping it. Not the best, but fun and works well enough.

I received the retail version, with the mounting hardware and rubber foot. Even though I ordered the shorter 285mm option, I had to cut about 1.5 inches off to make it work on my Trek Shift 3 with a 16.5" frame. Aside from the cutting, the install was very easy. I did not need the top plate or the long bolt to mount to this bike.

Great concept, tissue opening is fine for my tissue boxes, good trash bag size, I line it with grocery plastic bags. The opening doesn't stay opened at a convenient angle, and the walls always seem to collapse on itself a bit. I wish the opening would lock into place, or that there were some structure to the edges of the bag.

These fit my 67 Impala beautifully.  I had air shocks on the rear originally, and they always leaked out so I had to keep airing them back up.  Super cheesy.  These worked great and my car now sits very level.  I'm really happy with them.  The handling is also much improved.  Would an adjustable shock be better?  Probably... but for the money, this works fine for me.

LEDs are only 6.5 inch long. The rest is plastic casing. Lights were NOT centered so it looks odd on the bike. Water proofing were the wires come out will NOT be enough to stop even a little water. And the tiny gauge wire trash. Very bright RED leds. Amber is good too. But not worth keeping.

Unit worked at first in my solar lighting system (see photo).  A few weeks later it started failing.  Called and sent it back. They were very accommodating and sent me a new one.  Unlike many warrantee's, they opened and tested the new unit before shipping.  The replacement unit works even better than the original.  I sent them a note from their web page and they promptly called back to make sure I was happy with the unit.  They even offered me a large discount if I wanted to purchase a more powerful model.  I declined since this one was working well now.  Only better outcome for my system is if the original hadn't failed.

I installed these babies in my 2012 Fiat 500 Sport.  They do require drilling to properly mount, so you do have to be handy to install them.They are perfect for the Fiat 500's as the OEM pedals are tiny and the gas pedal is spaced far from the brake.  The gas pedal on these babies has an over-hang that brings the gas pedal closer to the brake for easier rev-matching!Not only are they functional, they look great as well!  I was able to find some rubber grommets at my local hardware chain store that I mounted in the holes of the clutch and brake pedals for extra grip (you don't want your gas pedal to be extra grippy).  With the textured surface, the grommets are not required for grip, but I like the look AND the extra grip!Do yourself a favor and GET THESE PEDALS!

Purchase a set of these to pair with some Tokico struts for my 2008 Scion XB.  I was trying to choose between the KYB brand & Moog brand, but it's hard to determine what items actually look like from a stock picture and how it would fit.  The Moog brand bellows look a lot longer than the KYB brand bellows; so I decided to go with the Moog brand because 1. a longer bellow would obviously offer more coverage/protection to the strut and 2. because I plan to pair them with the Moog brand strut mounts.  Looks like the KYB brand strut mounts aren't the same anymore and are gaining negative feedback.  I had no problem with fitment at all.  It was a little difficult to insert the bump stop into the bellow, but once it's in there, the fitment is nice and tight.  From the bottom of the bellow to the top of the bump stop, the entire bellow measures 10" 1/2" in length.

My Truck 2010 Chevy Silverado LT Z71.My small factory mirrors had power option only.I plugged in and the power mirrors work.  In addition I  have signals and heated mirrors working too with no special wiring.Heated mirrors operate off of your rear window defrost button.  If you do not have rear defroster you can wire to a switch but I don't know which wires to tell you.* These mirrors do NOT need leveling* Driver Mirror- no vibration* Passenger - vibration is minimal on rough roads but not a deal breaker on purchase* Color of signal - Amber more red than traditional marker lights.* Rear lights- black to ground and red to reverse wire.  Find color of reverse wire at your tail light and trace to fuse box or wire to switch. Test them before putting on door panel by using a 9v battery.  Black - & Red +* Very well built.* installation of both took 1 hour.  Very easy and easy to break one tab on your door panel near your door lock.  I included a picture.For everyone who says my truck looked better before I agree with you.  I pull boats and farm equipment a lot and interstate travel.  My truck looks low in pictures but I am 67 and was holding the camera high.I will post pictures after I paint them to match my truck

This kit arrived very quickly.  It installed painlessly in my 2003 Sequoia.  The lamps were an exact fit replacement.  Make sure the shield on the lamp goes to the bottom and trim dust cover to clear new diameter of lamp housing.  The only items needed for install were a drill, adjustable wrench, razor, zip ties and self tapping screws.  Everything was plug and play, no wire stripping or crimping, grounding locations were easy to find.  After sanding and buffing my yellow headlights to clear again and installing this HID kit I have amazing headlights now at a very reasonable price.  If you have an older model Sequoia I would recommend this kit highly.  Thanks!

This winch work great! I've mounted mine to a car hauler and use it to pull cars onto the trailer, so I haven't really approached its operational limits. The only complaints that I have are that the connector assembly mounting bracketry is pretty poorly designed and that the base mounting system uses a captured square nut arrangement that would allow a thief to remove the bolts from the backside of the mounting location. I recommend to the manufacturer that a lock-nut arrangement would be better. The unit is made in China, however I have not noted any material quality or workmanship issues.In case you're looking for ideas, I've added some photographs showing how I've mounted the winch and added a protective cover.

I installed them yesterday and let me tell you it's the easiest break change ever... I'm not sure why you would need drilled and slotted on a keep tho but I did feel a big difference when it came to making those quick stops my gues is that it shortens the stopping distance by 20-35 feet... would recommend for anyone trying to upgrade their brakes especially when u have big tires like I do..

THE BRILLIANCE IS DAZZLING!!!!The first time I used this product I threw down a layer on my Camaro after stripping and claying, before the first coat of Blackfire Wet Diamond Paint Sealant. I topped that off 12 hours later with another coat of sealant than a layer of wax. My car's shine lasted for months. The next time I washed the car I applied another coat of Black Light so as to avoid the wax build up. What an excellent product this is! Makes the Camaro look brand new every single time. This is a quality, outstanding product that I would recommend to use between waxes and as an alternative to machine polishing on cars with hardly any swirls. Black Light covers up minor imperfections and holds its shine for months! Go for it!!!

I bought at a second hand store in my area for around 5 bucks... it's pretty good overall.  I washed with Eagle One Nano Wax in a foam cannon and applied Mags 205 last week and removed, it is more of a sealant than a wax.  First, I wiped my car down with a california duster (I live next to a dusty road) and I applied with a drill and 4" buffer pad and left my car in a very cool area for around 1 hour.Overall shine, eh.  I've seen waxes that make the car look brand new, such as NXT wax.  I'm not sure I'd spend $14 for the kit

As a bed extender, it works great.  Flipped out, straps lock into tailgate latches, does the trick.  Flipped in, fits under a tonneau cover easily, tailgate closes, provides a nice small enclosed area for smaller items like groceries from rolling all over the bed.  Then it removes easily with no tools for when you don't need it, goes back on just as easily.Installing the thing, the instructions could be better.  Here's some tips that will make it easier for you.  These are specific to the 2015 - 2018 Chevy Colorado / GMC Canyon.- The "tools required" section, you do not need a rivet gun or soapy water, no idea why those are listed.  Not listed, you need a file to remove burs and primer for drill hole edges (this is mentioned in the relevant instruction step but not in the tools required section).  Then a 21/64" drill bit?  Does such a thing even exist?  Instead use the common 5/16" bit.  It also fails to mention what size wrench(s) you will need but the answer is 13mm (nuts and bolts are M8 size).- There are two templates to show you where to drill the first holes.  Reading the reviews, there appears to be a lot of confusion about exactly on which pieces to line up the templates.  There are three possibilities but only one is right.  I've attached three pics showing the wrong and right positions.  The right one has the upper hole over the taillight screw (screw is already removed in that pic) and the lower hole over the bolt to which the tailgate cable attaches (not the bolt the tailgate latches to when closed).- You do have to remove your taillights but that's pretty simple.  However the space to squeeze in your hand to thread the nuts onto the bolts is very tight.  It is worth having one of those telescoping magnet pickup doodads handy in case you drop a nut and have to fish it out.The rest of the instructions are pretty straightforward so with the tips above the install should go smoothly.  Have fun.

Bought these for our 2014 Jeep Wrangler. We wanted something more secure to mount the mirrors when the doors are off. In addition to the mounts, we bought new mirrors. It is easier than relocating them. These hold up very well and I would recommend them over some of the cheaper options.

I am happy with the fit and finish of the Moog part, but time will tell. I am mostly an OEM parts type of guy and I'm really picky about repair parts in general.Anyway, I thought I would give a couple of pointers to those installing this Pitman Arm on GM vehicles. I remove the skid plate and sway bar (good time to check/replace the bushings while you are there). This gives you plenty of room to work. The challenge replacing the pitman arm is that there is a cross member on GM trucks and SUV's that prevent you from using a standard pitman arm puller. Even if you can get a puller on there many times they are stuck so tight that the puller will break. Some sites are advising people to remove the entire steering box to get a puller on there, big time waster.  Or use heat, a torch, etc. and your steering box seals will be destroyed. I don't do any of that.I use a cutoff wheel on an air grinder and CAREFULLY make a cut on the side of the pitman arm opposite the actual arm at a 45 degree angle almost through the pitman arm. You could also use an electric 4" grinder with a cutoff wheel if you don't have a pneumatic like this:http://www.amazon.com/Kawasaki-840788-3-Inch-Air-tool/dp/B003G3009Y/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1413520263&sr=1-1&keywords=pneumatic+cutoff+toolI make the cut at a 45 degree angle so that the wheel has more clearance and less chance of hitting the steering box. Do this very slowly, you are trying to make a cut that comes within about 1/8" inch from the internal splines on the steering box without touching them. Take your time, really take you time, you don't want to buy a new steering box. Did I say take your time?:) When the cut is made take a large chisel and put it in the cut. Then smack it really hard with a mini-sledge. That will crack the rest of the pitman arm steel along the cut line. Then just hold the chisel at a downward angle and tap the pitman off. Even taking your time this is easily done in 15 min. There are plenty of stories of people spending hours trying to do this job. Then put just a light coat of water proof grease on the steering box splines for reassembly and you're done. I hope this helps.

I've purchased two of these filters, one for me and one for a friend. This is one of the best improvements you can do for your motorcycle! Superior quality and function. Extra sealing ring is included with full instructions printed on the box. The service/shipping from PC Racing is excellent! Made in U.S.A.

This won't work @ least for the rear brakes on the VW.If your piston has grooves, it means it will get pushed in by rotation only and not with this tool.You can buy another kit that offers adapters for each piston head, or use a simple needle nose pliers, and hold it within the grooves and rotate the piston clockwise and it will go in easy. ( I saw a video on youtube showing this technique when I got stuck with this tool).

For $10, I now have: 2 led front running lights(2825), 2 led rear side-marker lights(2825), 1 led license plate light(168), and although the packaging says nothing about being compatible with 921, gave it a shot and these bulbs work great and fit well for my 2 reverse / backup lights(921). brighter than factory in all applications so far in my 1997 Honda CR-V. I have occasionally had to flip a bulb around while installing, but it really doesn't matter if you remember to try it before putting things back together. Used 7 out of the pack of 10, haven't encountered a defective bulb or had one burn out in the bunch, and still have 3 spares. They are cheap, but decently sturdy, and reflect well in housings designed for factory bulbs. I once tried to install one on the license plate light on a 2009 impala, and while it fit the plug well, the housing was designed for an even tinier bulb and so wouldn't fit. Only time I had an issue

I purchased the stripes for a 2003 Mini Cooper. The package arrived on time and in ok condition. The package did no thave any instructions what so ever adn both stripes were attached to a single roll. IN spite of the lack of instructions I was able to get a decent result. The product itself is ok as far as quality. The adhesive was not the best and the stripes are very easily scratched. I like the looks but the quality could be better but then the price was on the cheaper side.

I purchased Griot's Garage Speed shine on a recommendation of an auto enthusiasts forum I follow. I used it with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Griot-s-Garage-11153-Paint-Cleaning-Clay/dp/B003POLA84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Griot's Garage 11153 Paint Cleaning Clay</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Griot-s-Garage-Glass-Cleaning-Clay/dp/B002WDFDF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Griot's Garage Glass Cleaning Clay</a>&nbsp;and the combination works very well. The deposits on both paint and glass were removed without leaving streaks and without too much work on my part.Speed shine has almost no scent, provides good cleaning and is a good surface for the clay to glide on. I enjoyed working with it.The 35 oz bottle is fairly large. I am attaching a collage of two photos under customers photos. Photo #1 has the bottle next to a ruler for relative size. The sprayer worked well - a nice generous even spray. Photo #2 shows how much I used during one cleaning during which I only used it for claying the windows before I used it to clay the body paint. I was a bit surprised how much I used in one application.  Based on the amount I used I would guess the entire bottle will last me through 4-5 cleaning jobs.This kit comes with 3 micro fiber towels.  I find micro fiber towels an important part of getting great streak free results.  I use more than 3 towels in one car wash, so  I bought a large bag of micro fiber towel at CostCo.  However, I like these towels as a supplement because they are a different color.  This way I can use them for a specific job, such as applying&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mothers-06108-Back-to-Black-Trim-Care/dp/B0002U1TXK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mothers 06108 Back-to-Black Trim Care</a>on the plastic parts of the car and don't mix them up with my yellow washing/drying towels from CostCo.Thumbs up overall!Ali Julia review

Color looks great but that's all about it. It is not as bright. I have projectors and I never had issues with regular D2S bulbs but with these I get dark spots all over with no cut off. Unfortunately I am returning them, I ordered 2 sets for my headlights and fogs.Seller will try to con you into giving you a $30 Amazon credit and ask you to change your honest review into something different. After the review has been changed and 5 stars given, no credit is ever applied.

Once I had them in my hand and I felt them I was really surprised the quality is outstanding. Even the box where they came in, really good feel, it didn't feel like a $35 product. They can be adjusted in case you want them closer or further from the grips which is a plus.Good things:- Awesome quality- Great looking levers- Adjustable- Easy to installBad things:- None to meHighly recommended!

Very disappointed with light bar. I have had it on my UTV for about a week and have washed it once and light bar already has moisture in it. It looks like the seal was never installed properly and is not fully seated around the lense.Update: They sent me an email about the water issue and sent me a new light. Hopefully this one holds up better. Good customer service

I tried to fix 200 Rx8 Front Lead spark plug whole with this, and possibly I am not using it correctly. I don't want to cause more damage some I did about 10 soft passes, and still plug won't go in right. But I think the issue is the thread at the bottom is the issue, and so i will try again later. Great product if it works right. I think I can get it to work right, just need to be a little less timid.

Received the wheel a day early!! Tremendous difference in feel, texture, weight. Been playing DriveClub with it and you can really feel the road better and the grip to to drift or sling-shoting through bends with getter control. Though the button layout is on point with color, but identification would've been nice so you don't have to figure out which is what when changing button configuration. Love the center yellow line! Yellow stitching would make it like a wheel in a Porsche 997:-). Still the wheel deserves a5 star. Awesome  check out my rig upgraded add-on'sUpdate:Looking at the wheel very, very closely I notice a few scratches around the green, red, yellow buttons. When I first tried to use the d-pad for Project Cars it isn't wanting to be pressed!! I literally have to press the right directional button hard, to hard where it actually selects the down button:-(. Don't know if I need to return it or trade it for a thrustmaster F1 add on.

Easiest installation I have done in a long time.  Base plate is very sturdy.  Two different sized screws make sense. The ladder itself is sturdy enough, however the very bottom rung bends very easily.  Any debirs on ground level will fold it.  A slightly thicker piece of metal would probably fix this issue. I plan on welding a support across the bottom rung.

These are great! I see what people mean about the 'teeth' on back and worrying about it tearing up their carpet however I don't imagine they will move around enough to damage anything.  The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is that there are some areas that the plastic bows and doesn't confirm well (see photos) especially in the back and over the center bump.Also, we had to do a little work to get the holes in the front mats to push through onto the existing locks. But once we got it they look great, fit well, and for the most part conform!NOTE: I used these in a 2016 Rogue SL AWD

I installed this thermostat on my 1998 Dodge Durango with a 5.2L, I always had an annoying problem during the summer in Florida, the engine driven HD clutch was constantly engaging at 100%, making an unbearable noise, with increased fuel consumption.There was nothing wrong with the engine and its cooling system; the engine did not overheat at any time.After I installed this high flow thermostat, the fan now works more freely, the fan noise has decreased substantially, and the mileage has increased because the fan is not loading as much. The temperature of the engine remains constant as before.I tested both thermostats (the new and the one) side by side in a pot with boiling water, both thermostats were completed covered with water.Observations:The new thermostat has a larger opening that the original factory versionThe old thermostat, opened slower and partially (both thermostat are 195 F)Pictures below original OEM thermostat bronze color, new thermostat silver color. Check the difference on the diameter of the opening.Checking the old thermostat will help you in troubleshooting any problems that you may have with your cooling system, older thermostats do get worn down, and they open slower and partially after few years.Like the review?, give it a thumbs up

Installation went rather smoothly for my 1997 F150 XLT 4x4. Only replaced two front discs/rotors so it was fairly straight forward for a 20 year old truck.As far as installation and non-excessive braking, they are phenomenal! They look great and stop as they should.However my braking time/distance has slightly become longer. I bled my brakes, made sure to not get any lubricant on the pads or rotors, etc. I did not bother sanding/resurfacing the rotors. Everything has been torqued to spec and I am not losing any brake fluid.EVEN MORE, this weekend I drove down a long sloping hill in the CO mountains and I significantly lost braking power once the brakes became hot! This was terrifying as I was downshifted to first and I was slamming the brakes on turns (without riding the brakes) while not slowing down as much!!! I need to re-inspect my installation but man that scared the sh*t out of me. Shortly after the brakes cooled back down, my braking power returned completely. Will update if I discover any flaws or if the seller offers advice. My previous brakes did nothing like this on hills, perhaps they were not ceramic pads(?)...

The drawback, and it's a big one, is that now you have the weight of this unit, plus the weight of the light, all on two little screws that were only meant to hold a license plate.

I was simply installing the metal ring, that fit inside the locking tabs, there was a weak tab that broke right off, without force. But it got even worse...after pulling the first factory hubcap off; I could easily see it was smaller than these caps. I was buying these and other auto products on here, to spruce up my maids very first car, as a surprise, giving it a pink female appearance :)  I hadn't seen her tire size, so I  used Amazon car filter, to get correct sizes for her specific car, all were all the incorrect sizes. Now after trying to put the caps and other items on, I know the real correct size and hopefully won't have weak tabs that break off on second try... Stay tuned ;)One of the morals of the story...Don't take Amazon's Vehicle filter for factual,.make sure to look at the tires you want to put new hubcaps on. looking for the numbers next to "R", as an example in the picture  "P185/65R14", you have an "R14", so buy 14" hubcaps. What ever the numbers after the R is the size you buy :) That's it for todays lesson class ;) lol

These reflectors are crucial and a must have if you have either eliminated the stock Fender that comes with the bike or you bought the bike with a Fender Eliminator.To pass motorcycle inspection in Pennsylvania, The motorcycle has to have rear reflectors. These reflectors act as the requisite reflectors needed to pass the motorcycle inspection. When I took my motorcycle for inspection, I noticed a lot of motorcycles with similar reflectors.

I purchased this F16 series for my 2015 WRX DRL. These bulbs have natural brightness which are the main reason why I bought these bulbs. What I also like anout these bulbs is that it has a dual cooling system (heat sinks and fan) to insure it doesn't get overheated.

Does not work for my 2007 Tahoe.  This seal/moulding only has one side to seal the door and the body.  The factory seal is two sided to seal between door and body and to inset/cover the gaps with the interior trim pieces.  Not to mention the factor seals are multi-level pieces with internal components to aid in the sealing (see pics)

I'm not big on vehicle mods.  I'm also not not particularly handy when it comes to cars, so the thought of doing anything that involved the brakes on my car scared me quite a bit.  I watched many videos on how to paint calipers to get comfortable with the process and make sure I knew what I was doing.  I also looked at the various options (spray paint vs. brush painting) as well as reading reviews on the various products and manufacturers.  In the end, it seemed that G2 was the best fit for me and I'm very glad I made the decision.I chose to paint the calipers on my new Audi A6 during a stretch of days in January that averaged in the high 50's and low 60's.  Even the company warns that you should only apply the paint between 56 and 70 degrees F.  Given I was in the ideal temperature range, I dove right in!Given my car was brand new (2017), I didn't need to spend a significant amount of time to clean the calipers as they were already pretty clean.  I did, however, focus on taping and masking off the parts of the wheel that must not/cannot be painted.  I also purchased artists brushes that work with enamel paints.  I did read that the brush that comes with the kit can shed.  I honestly didn't see that, but never gave it the chance and used my brushes anyway.I was able to add four coats of paint to my calipers.  The first coat took some time and was a light coat.  The last coat gave it a final, smooth finish.  I chose black to match the black-out look I was going for with my A6.I didn't have any problems applying the paint.  There were times when loaded too much paint on the brush and it dripped, but I was able to fix it easily.  I waited at least 15 minutes between coats.  Truth be told, I purchased two kits.  It was impossible for me to put my vehicle up on four jack stands, so I was only able to raise one wheel up at a time.  I would paint one caliper, let it sit for 2 hours, then put the wheel on and move to the next wheel.  I have heard that some people have successfully cut the paint and the hardening agent in half to save for later.  I didn't chose to do that as I feared I'd not have the right amount of hardener to paint and eventually the paint would fail.  Once all four wheels were completed, I waited two days to cure.  G2 says wait 24 hours, but the temperature in my garage dropped at night below 56 degrees so I wanted to give it more curing time.Once cured, I took the wheels off again and applied high-heat transfer stickers to the caliper to finish the look.  I am very pleased with the results and would recommend this product to anyone - as long as you have the time to devote to the cleaning, prep and painting as required.

Took about 10 minutes to install all of them on my 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe. I have went through many car washes and have had no issues with them coming off. I love these because I can keep the windows cracked while its raining outside and still get plenty of fresh air. I have been known to smoke a cigar once in a while and this is perfect for that. Offers additional protection from the sun since it is above your eye level, has a bit of a visor effect.

PROS; First off - one of the best packaging of any Amazon item I have purchased. This product is of excellent quality - paint matches vehicle well and product is sturdy. I will update review only if I have any future unresolved problem (ie stitching or glue fails). Ive only had the tire cover on for one day but so far so good. The tire cover really adds value to your car. My bare JK looks rugged and tough with no tire cover. However, this cover raises the "class factor" ) for lack of a better term) of the Jeep. With this cover I would fit right in, pulling into the carport of the "W" Hotel in Miami, handing the keys to the valet, and watching it get parked next to the Rolls Royce. This tire cover gives my Sahara a very nice polished look like the Mercedes SUV. I have wanted to buy the cover for 2 years but never got around to it. My 2017's exterior paint is granite crystal - thats a difficult color to match - they matched it brilliantly. Again, if you want your SUV to appear on the street roads as if its purchase price was $10,000 more than you actually paid then buy this cover. In fact, I know the tire cover would very much help sell the vehicle if I ever decided to sell it, but I won't of course. Do not let the price/cost of the item give you any hesitation, its well worth the money and not only will it add value to your car and help its resale, but the Boomerang Enterprises tire cover its made of superior quality material and care in its packaging. I should note I have absolutely no affiliation with this seller.CONS; Cover fits my brand new/unwarn tread, 32" tire perfectly...but if its very cold outside (lower than 40 degrees F. then when installing brand new cover for very first time you have to use a little elbow grease. But it should not take you more than 5 minutes.MY PHILOSOPHY; I do not want to generalize, but, a man walks on the boardwalk shirtless with a lot of metal necklaces doing hand stands periodically and pumping his chest, in an attempt to attract women (that would be the SUV with too much chrome, jacked up wheels and NO TIRE COVER). His identical twin with a similiar personality walks down Park Avenue in NYC, obviously in excellent shape and wearing an expensive suit on his way to his successful career job (that would be the well-maintained SUV WITH a BEAUTIFUL TIRE COVER). Which gentleman do you think attracts more women.

They say they won't chip they chipped the second time I removed them. The locking heads stripped during second removal and had to get them ripped off. To top it off the spline key split in half and now and had to rip them all off and definitely putting on a different set of lug nuts. Why they would make an aluminum key is just insane.

First, the Instructions that clearly say "Radiator Installation Sheet" has absolutely Nothing to do with Installation, at all.It's about Maintenance. That's right. I now possess the 1st radiator in History, that Requires MAINTENANCE.Apparently, it does not work as intended, right out of the Box, and will require Constant Supervision, for as long as it's Installed in my car.Secondly, the Advertisement Clearly states, that it has 1.25" Inlet/Outlet Ports.Well, that's a Lie. They're smaller than that, at 1 1/8". (1.125")They Do include some rubber sleeves to make up the Size difference, but you STILL are not going to have a 1 1/4" Port Size.Because with the sleeves installed, it makes the Port Size 1 3/8".The only benefit here, is the Automatic Transmission Cooler Ports.I was expecting a Manual Transmission Radiator, and instead, I got an Automatic.Which is Better, because it gives you an Extra Cooler, at no Additional Price.-----UPDATE-----It was a 3-star product, until Yesterday (60 days after purchase).It sprung a Major leak while I was driving around, 40 miles from home.I had to stop every few blocks, to refill the radiator with Puddle Water, and HOPE it was enough to get home.Manufacturer Defect Caused a Major Problem, and NOW, I have to buy Another radiator, because this one JUST RECENTLY ran out of its Warranty.Garbage Product, I will never buy Spectra Again.I almost lost my $3500 Built and Tuned engine because of it ! ! !

Fits like it should in my 2012 Camry. I had been using this Fram filter for the past couple of changes -&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/FRAM-CF10285-Fresh-Breeze-Cabin-Air-Filter/dp/B001CEG90I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">FRAM CF10285 Fresh Breeze Cabin Air Filter</a>&nbsp;. The first thing I noticed comparing this Kootek filter to the Fram were the number of pleats. I counted 13 pleats on the Fram filter, compared to 22 on this Kootek one. That should mean more surface area and theoretically better filtering. I compared the recirculated air flow before and after changing the filter and noticed a higher output afterward. I attribute that more to the filter being clean, but it did show this filter isn't any less restrictive. Another difference is the Fram filter has a distinct carbon side, while this one seems to be embedded in the pleated material. The airflow on my Camry goes from up to down. There's an arrow directing which way it should be installed (down in my case), but because of how this filter is, it really wouldn't matter which way it's installed. So far it's working well and for just a little more than a single Fram filter, it's a better deal. I received a free sample for my review.

So far no problems, Be sure to warm engine, pull coil packs soak with Kroil or any penetrating oil overnight remove plugs next day works better as shown in pic, no plugs broke on L/H bank (CYL 1-4). Lisle Removal tool worked as advertised. #5 plug sheared at wrenching point had to use ez-out to remove plug. Used the Accel coil packs, 30-50mph shudder went away, I had long thought it was the OD/Tranny it was not. Idle was off after plugs and coil replacements disconnected battery idle got a little better, no codes present.A week later white smoke and fuel was coming out tail pipe (injector stuck) rich bank 2 code, and missfire #5, #6 and #8 narrowed it down to #8 injector. Now truck runs even better 205000 miles.

I replaced a burned out GE nighthawk bulb with one of these long life bulbs. I had been using those high performance bulbs but the bulb life of those was only a few months and I felt like I was replacing them often. I figured this long life bulbs would be the fix. Not quite... One lasted about a week and became cloudy when it failed. I don't know what that means but I know I won't buy these again.

Installed these on my boat this summer.  They replaced my halogen spreader lights.  Not only do they look great and use less wattage, but the lumens blows my halogen lights out of the water  Install was pretty straight forward, but getting the bracket on the first light proved to be a little bit of a challenge.  Once I got that figured out the other lights went much faster.  My boat is wet slipped, so it sits outside exposed to all of the elements and thus far no water intrusion issues.  The nice thing is, if I do have a problem they are cheap enough that I can just buy another one.

A very strong tote, this&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Aomaso-Auto-Trunk-Organizer/dp/B01F3ALUI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Aomaso Auto Trunk Organizer</a>&nbsp;is more sturdy than most every solid plastic laundry basket I have.  When setup (literally takes 2 seconds to unclip and slide the bottoms down), this organizer can handle just about any shopping trip or storage need for my car.  I like to keep things in the car for so many purposes, spare oil quart, spare paper towels, emergency items (blanket, pillow, etc.); this console organizer holds it all for me. The design has the outer walls being very strong and sturdy, after opening the bottoms folds down and gives the chest much more stability.  This organizer has a unique feature, a reflective traffic triangle, great for setting on the ground behind a disabled vehicle to make yourself noticeable/visible while you deal with an emergency on a busy road.The chest features lots of storage, two large open spaces, with a front pockets and mesh pockets on each longer side.  The organizer can be stored flat when not needed, but I will be using this thing all the time to keep my gear in the car from sliding all over. The handles are good and strong, and surprisingly it is easy and stable to carry this chest when full of items. Grommets on both sides allow me to easily secure this in the car.[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]

One of the easiest things I've ever had to do was install this product. The most difficult part is getting the old bumper off because of the clearance. I was able to install this on my creeper with an air impact and 18mm ratcheting wrench in a matter of minutes. I elected to add 1.75" front spacers the day before as seen in the photo.

I installed these on a 2016 Ram 1500 Crew Cab Laramie ED. I am giving 4 out of 5 stars because I think the directions are definitely lacking and the hardware is questionable. The 8 x 25mm bolts that attach the boards to the mounts were mixed (different brand/mfg???) forcing me to use a 13mm socket on some and a 14mm on others. Installation took me over an hour for the drivers side and under an hour for the passenger side. Total of ~2 hours.I installed them biased towards the front. Others may have installed them biased towards the back, but things didn't seem to line up as well when I did this.The boards themselves are great and really do make it easier to enter the vehicle.  I was originally going to sandblast and repaint the steel mounts with POR15 for corrosion protection, but decided to cover everything in fluid film instead. I sprayed the frame areas down prior to bolting up the mounts and then hit the mounts/bolts/nuts/etc. after the boards were on and everything was tightened down. I hit every bolt with anti-sieze too.

...in order for it to function as it should gets knocked to a 50 percentile status in my opinion. So my initial rating for this lock is 2.5 stars. It crept up to four stars because it does function well and looks factory original. I installed this lock on my 2006 GMC Sierra.I included some pictures of the "out-of-the-box" condition of the locking mechanism. The device is made in Taiwan. The assembly and finish are just a bit off and relatively crude; a typical cheap third world product. If you look at the pictures you'll find the key slot is not perpendicular to the ground. This means the locking arm is not perpendicular either. Ultimately this means the locking arm is not positioned to provide optimum security. To improve on this I removed the locking arm from the lock cylinder, loosened the lock cylinder retaining nut and repositioned and re-tightened the lock cylinder. After reinstalling the locking arm it was in a much better position and capable of providing a stronger level of security.Installation was relatively straight forward although it took me a couple or three attempts to get the locking mechanism positioned correctly. In removing the factory trim, I would recommend using a plastic putty knife or the equivalent rather than a screw driver ...less chance to scratch the paint.*Strong Advice* - if you have a tonneau cover that latches inside the truck box, open it and roll or retract it back from the tailgate to allow you access to the lock mounting screw. In order for the locking mechanism to be positioned correctly the tailgate has to be in the closed position. If for some reason you failed to read *all* of the instructions *before* doing the installation and you installed the lock with the tailgate open ...and you subsequently shut the tailgate ...you might find you can't get the gate open. A word to the wise ...I found the supplied stainless mounting screw to work just fine. It is just long enough to do the job so it's important you get the locking mechanism positioned correctly. Once installed, the locking device worked okay. The tailgate latch was a bit "gritty" in opening but adding some grease to the "wings" (see photo) and a bit of oil to the pivot point smoothed things out.Overall the function and security of the lock is good. Will it stop a determined thief? Probably not. Consider this lock more of a deterrent than bonafide security. In my case I was able to pull fairly hard on the tailgate latch, to the point the handle began to bend a little, and the lock held. I think maybe the plastic tailgate handle on my truck would break before the lock would fail.Overall this is not a bad lock but spotty construction/poor quality control may render some of these locks less secure or even totally ineffective. Also be aware this same lock is marketed under both "Bully" and "Pilot" or "Pilot Automotive" trade names (they are all the same company). Based on my experience I would recommend this lock with caution. If you are someone who can "fiddle" something to work better then this lock will be okay. If not, then don't be surprised if things don't go as anticipated.

First off, this thing is really bright! I wasn't sure how good it'd be when I ordered it, because the price seemed too good to be true, but I went ahead and got it, and I love it!A few downsides about this thing though, is that the brackets that came with it wouldn't fit on the roof of my truck, but I am a pretty good fabricator and made my own brackets. (And that's not really the bar's fault it was too long with the includes brackets)Second, like others said here in the reviews, after about a few weeks of rain and a truck wash, sure enough, I started to see condensation inside the bar.. And lots of it. I took off the lens and ran a bead of silicone around it, but that didn't seem to fix anything.. So now I'm going to try and put a few silica gel packets in there and see if maybe that helps dry it up. But that's kinda a shot in the dark.. I'm not even sure if that'll do anything..But in the end, if you have the extra couple bucks, and have the few extra minutes to maybe try and seal it off, then get this bar. It's great for the price, very bright, and looks really nice on my truck. (as long as there's no condensation on the lens.. Haha)

Color me not impressed. Does not fit 2018 Tacoma even though it says it does. Back bracket on driver's side off by at least 1/4 of an inch no matter what I do, I spent an hour trying different solutions to try and get them to line up. I don't have the patience nor tools to modify it myself to fit (nor should I even have to think about doing this.)

Application: 2003 Toyota Sequoia SR5The keyring hole on my OEM remote finally snapped. I looked on eBay for used OEM units but they all look beat up and I feared the keyring hole would break soon after purchase. I decided to try just the outer shell of the unit. Reason being the circuitry inside is from my OEM remote and should work just as good. The item came to me already in in two halves, which in hindsight was a good thing. Once you snap it together it is hard to come apart. The outer case of this unit is textured slightly unlike the OEM. The buttons are exactly like the OEM remote, down to the dimple on the 'Lock' button. It does have the waterproof membrane on the inside, as well as a sealing o-ring. Fit was perfect and accepted the circuit board without issue. Buttons are responsive and have no problems operating.In my photos the KeylessOption is on the left and the OEM Toyota remote is on the right.

Great purchase.  I read that others build their own from PVC pipe, but I don't see how those would survive the blows I landed on this.Not only is it great for installing the seal, it also is used to hammer in the axle only the knuckle, and will stop when the seal is installed just far enough, based on how the to was made. See pics.

This light is mounted on the top of my truck and it looks great! It's so incredibly bright I can hardly stand driving at night without it! It's so durable and strong, I do some pretty serious off-roading and this has stood up to every ounce of punishment I've dished it. I've driven through tree branches, mud holes, terrible downpours, snow storms, and various insane elements that would normally take out other LED bars but hasn't effected this in the least. Wiring isn't included other than the wires coming directly out of the unit but you don't need to be an electrician to install these things. Bottom line: Great light bar, great price, incredibly durable, and EXTREMELY bright!

Looks just like in the product picture.I installed this in my 2016 Ford Fiesta ST along with the following products to get the look in my photo:*&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Torque-Solution-Billet-Reverse-Lockout-Collar-Subaru-Universal-12x1-25/dp/B00GXXK0HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Torque Solution Billet Reverse Lockout Collar: Subaru / Universal 12x1.25</a>* Bend Shifter Extension Toyota Scion Lexus Suburu M12X1.25 (from eBay)You need the lockout collar for the reverse lockout to work. No shift ball will work on a Fiesta without the collar.With this setup I can slide my seat back farther to get comfortable clutch action and still reach the shifter comfortably.Also my elbow no longer hits against the armrest when shifting.The ball itself is heavy, gives a satisfying heft to shifts and it feels great in my hand.

Bought for a 2010 Lexus RX 350. Fit great. Quality piece. I use same brand on my diesel truck. Makes oil changes easier and less messy. BUT on the Lexus it is the lowest point to the ground. I don't plan on off roading the car. You just never know. If we happen to hit anything ever it would bust off or open easily. Not worth the risk to me. Wish it would've worked out. I do like having these on my vehicles.

Wasn't a perfect fit but it was acceptable.  That's why I gave it four stars.  In my photo, the two red circles it didn't cover that area so it wasn't a perfect fit.  But it looked nice and I'll accept that and keep it so it was worth the money.

All in I'm very happy with these, after 2 - 3 hours futzing with connectors and wire placement. Installation was a snap with the PIAA 30330 brackets from Amazon, and the kit contained the minimum additional items needed.Pros?Bright white light in a vertically tight pattern that you can easily aim where you wantDirect replacement for stock Jeep JK fogs in OE and aftermarket bumpersCrazy low power consumptionCute little illuminated switch - if yours worksWorkable kit with a reasonable minimum number of parts to get you connectedDid I say white light, like cure-for-seasonal-affective-disorder white?Cons?These aren't long-range or driving lights. If you're pre-running the Baja look for something elseWiring is very light gauge, and the harness is short for anything but a WranglerThe switch will work while you're shopping for a real oneNeed to be mounted on the level; pattern is vertically narrow and broadThe white light output will make you start shopping for a headlight upgradeI'm going to ding them a point for the switch, since mine's ground broke off and the LED doesn't light.All in all, I find them to be a very usable close-in light source that's pleasantly white, not yellow. For lighting up the trail 50 - 75' in front of the Jeep they're going to be terrific. Not enough fog here to check that aspect.Regarding the install:If you're moderately obsessive like me (and didn't have the stock lights or wiring) you'll like a roll of split loom to route and protect the tiny wires, a fuse tap pigtail (Pico 0956pt) the Daystar firewall boot and probably a Rugged Ridge rocker switch, all available here. If you're using the stock fog light wiring and and switch you can wire them direct.If you're using the PIAA brackets load the lights in the brackets (the mounting ears face front), take the top panel off from below the grille / behind the bumper and reach down to screw them in. To use PIAA's wiring, route the wire harness up the side of the radiator toward the fuse box / TIPM. Ground the black wire under one of the body grounds or to the battery.If you're brave, drill a 3/4 hole where you want the switch. The A pillar works fine, Thread the switch wires through, and pop the switch in. I routed the wires through a punchout in the firewall below the steering linkage, and up across the back of the engine cowl inside the rather loose rubber seal there. The Jeep forums can school you on the intricacies of wiring into the Jeep's system; it's not the most intuitive.Wheel in light!

I couldn't be more pleased with these.  I've used them to haul my girlfriend's SV650s and my Hayabusa.  The 32" length has fit perfectly on both.  The bike stays stable in transit and there's no damage whatsoever to the grips, bar ends, or controls.  I'll never haul a bike without these.

The lights needed slight modification to fit into the headlight.  I had to cut back a tab about 1/8".  But after playing with them a little bit, I was able to get them to work.  The headlight heat sink is adjustable, which is key to get proper reflection out of the headlight.  It comes with a small allen wrench to adjust.  These are pretty much plug and play, as advertised.I attached a photo to compare the LED lights installed next to the halogen.  Look at that difference!  Next I will replace the high beams!

I mounted this onto a new bumper and it was real easy to install, the instructions are really clear. All the wires are color and letter coded so if you screw it up you shouldn't be using it. The wires to the battery are definitely long enough to route around the engine compartment to conceal them nicely. Overall real easy install and a tough winch, looks great too!

So far so good almost no dust.They don't rust and stopping is good.The break in procedure can be a little tough pending where you live.Multiple hard stops from different speeds.7-8k on these still better than the other options in the same price range. No dust issues and stopping works well but it's not a huge difference that I've noticed. But my stock set went 130k. Last pic different wheels same brakes.1/5/17Brakes still work like new 14k I will be getting these again!4/29/17Had to remove brakes due to a piston on the caliper blew.Wish I had taken pictures but the power stop pads and rotors show no sign of wear.Cleaned them up and reinstalled them they looked as they did new.Very pleased with them.Update!So I thought I was being proactive by doing both calipers!The caliper that did not need to be replaced but I did it also seized!!!,It took some life out of the pads and kinda discolored the rotor. Cleaned everything up and relubed replaced caliper with another from our local advance and they still work as good. I wish I gotten the powerstop calipers when I purchased the kit.

At first this was a good product.  After six months of using this product the top bar has rusted bad.  I live in San Antonio where there is not much wet weather and I only use it when I store the RV.  It is very unsightly.  Not real happy.

Well for starters it didn't come with all the needed hardware and the hardware it did bring was not the best as it takes a special size allen rench to tighten the screws and to add insult to injury they are extremely short for their purpose as I was unable to use any of the supplied nuts for the screws.

After asking about this product and whether it would fit my Softail Deluxe 2013 with my pillion (passenger) seat, I decided to go for it. It turned out to be very nice. Product is of very good quality, heavy and firm. Chrome finish is great and the pad is comfortable and nice looking too.Installation was easy after I figured out that it has to go between the Driver seat and the rounded chrome frame fitted into it as can bee seen from my first photo. The rest was a piece of cake. It also looks very nice on my ride as can be seen from the rest of the photos.There is more to wish for from this product as an adjustable height or angle would have made it Perfect. This is why I rated it with 4 stars instead of 5. In any case, compared with HD products and other after-market quality products, it is almost half price if not less which makes it a pretty good bargain. At least now I get to enjoy sitting back (with a back-rest to rest on) especially for those long trips.I would definitely recommend this product.

Great product. Fast shipping. They are tall flairs. Not the whimpy thin ones. Thats what I was worried about.  They are very bushwacker esk.  Which is exactly what I wanted. Great product. Great price. Great company. Wish I vould get one of their stickers for my truck because the logo is even sweet!  Will be buying more products from them too. Already have their tow mirrors and they are great as well!

This Tekton digital tire gauge is defective and innaccurate. I checked my motorcycle tires and both tires kept reading 0.00. Only once did this tire gauge read 3.5 psi on my rear motorcycle tire. I am so sick and tired of seeing frugal and feeble products online that is there to waste your money. I am returing this Chinese junk. The company never gave me a recepit nor anything in writing that explains how to return this product.

I ordered 2 to replace my tail light circuit since both over heated and melted the top bulb casing.  I have a 2008 Trailblazer and was easy to take out the old and replace it. I will be ordering some more in the near future since these are cheaper then going to the auto store, dealership or a junkyard.

What an absolutely poorly made POS !!! This pump quit within 2 weeks of being installed and the rear one(2007H) is working at 1/2 the PSI it should be making,. I pulled the front pump out and found this crap on the contact points.

Save your money! The one on the right is the OEM part and the one on the left is the "grey" one they sent. I decided I would keep it since it is so much cheaper than buying a new OEM one, but it is so poorly made that it broke on the first use. I wish I could rate it zero stars.

Purchased these for my 2007 FJ Cruiser.  Paid $173 INCLUDING SHIPPING!  Was a little hesitant because of the amazingly great price for drilled/ slotted rotors AND pads, but I researched all over the web for any bad reviews and could find only positive.  So, I took the plunge and couldn't be happier.  They look cool, the stopping power is wayyyy improved and brake dust is no worse than with the stock pads.  Another nice feature I noticed is that the anti-squeal shims are built into the pads unlike on the stock pads.  You won't find a shop that will replace your PADS for this price, much less to turn or replace your rotors. I've added some pictures of the rotors installed on my FJ in the product photos section.  Buy these, you won't be disappointed.

...the jury's still out on durability.Here are a few first impressions on the strut install and function. First off, I obsessed way to much on the price vs. performance of the products that do basically the same thing - hold the tailgate open. Finally settled on this thanks to a little help from previous reviewers.The part arrived fine; looks good, with beefy brackets and quality looking coated self tapping screws. No instructions were provided, but are available at http://rampageproducts.com/instructions/interior/86618-interior.pdfOnce piece of advice: make sure your tailgate is open to its full travel, then assemble the thing and make sure it's level and located where you want it before drilling holes. I didn't follow the 13 3/4" offset in the instruction sheet illustration and was glad I didn't.Pre-drill the 1/8" holes for the self tapping screws - make sure you don't punch all the way through and dink the outside skin of the tailgate. The sheet metal is thicker than you'd expect behind the spot welds.Gate is easy to close, and pushes itself open pretty doggone quick, although the last bit of travel has a nice soft stop before the lock drops in. It'll take you a while to get used to unlatching it before the tailgate will move.

My husband is a volunteer fireman and needed emergency lights for his truck.  He didn't think one would be enough so we purchased two and he put them side by side.  He actually flipped the bracket around and hung one upside down so the lights would be in order (blue/white/blue/white).  Whatever makes him happy, I guess!  lolThe lights affix securely with the attached suction cups and have 18 flashing modes so he had plenty to choose from.  He has had these for about a month and we have had no issues with them.  They are very bright and can be seen easily.

I have had this wiring harness since February and i honestly think it is the best one for your money. It is meant for 2 lights but I spliced in a 14" light bar and the really and fuse are fine. Could probably wire up a few more lights to it and still be fine.

Great product. I used it to replace the old rotted air duct hose on my 05' MB C230 SS (M271 Engine). As any Mercedes owner know, parts can be on the $$$$ side. An OEM replacement would have cost me in the neighborhood of $125-150. This item cost only $20, and in my humble opinion, looks better and is a lot more sturdy than the stock "cloth-like" hosing. It's highly configurable (expands/contracts like an Accordion) and comes with two durable rubber couplers for snug fit. Overall, very please with this product.

Once bolted up, the flat surface is not level with the body of my new Jeep Wrangler.  The bend that creates the right angle is off, causing the antenna to lean 4 degrees off vertical.  This part is machined poorly.  Don't buy this one!  By-the-way, Amazon is fantastic about dealing with stuff like this!

The stinger works great for installation, but the bolt/bridge extractor - well - don't spend extra money for it...The instructions say to drill a 3/16" hole through the frost plug to thread in the self tapping bolt.  There is no way that size drill bit will work. I used multiple sized bits moving up from 3/16" to 1/4" and I was finally able to get the bolt to self tap into the plug.Here's the problem fellas - when you start drawing the center of the plug - it actually TIGHTENS the plug in the bore. Eventually it just rips the bolt out of the center of the plug - leaving you with a tighter plug.  Use a small cold chisel and hammer along the inner edge of the frost plug (not touching the block) to tap one side of the plug into the block. This will allow you to get hold of the opposite side of the plug with a pliers to pull it out of the block.  Clean/dress the holes with fine sandpaper and lacquer thinner to remove all traces of grease/dirt/water - then paint the hole in the block with Permatex liquid gasket sealant just before using the Stinger to install the plug.Now the good part -The stinger will work at multiple angles to drive the new plug (don't cheap-out on the plugs - use BRASS) into the block.  You will need a good sized mallet to drive the plugs home.  I use a 5# lead maul as it does not peen over the end of the Stinger.  If you use steel hammer, you will peen the Stinger..Now obviously this tool is not magic. You need to have line of sight to the block plug to use the tool.  You may have to raise the engine up and remove motor mounts, etc. That makes it tougher, but unless you remove the engine from the car, it just will not be an easy task.Take your time, keep your cool and you will get the old plug out and the new one installed.Believe me when I tell you that this tool is FAR superior to the old "bang the plug into the hole with an old socket" method..

Yep, they're bright. They put out more light than the OEM incandescent DRL bulbs in my Tahoe. They light up 20+ ft in front of my truck at night.EDIT - 3 MONTH UPDATE: Downgraded from 5 to 3 star. One of the bulbs is now flickering.EDIT - 4 MONTH UPDATE: Downgraded from 3 to 1 star. One bulb is now constantly strobing and flickering. When I pulled the bulb out to swap it from right to left and confirm it was the bulb and not my truck, the lens on the end of the bulb fell off. Also, the problem followed the bulb, confirming that it's the problem - not the truck. I've removed the product and replaced them with a Sylvania variant.

These bars are nice and takes maybe an hour total install time with a ratchet. Maybe an extra half hour to get everything level. They're painted more of a flat black. Not shiny but they have a hint of shine. The plastic pads are really cheap compared to rubber pads you'd find on other more expensive models but they hold up well. Make sure you put the right brackets where they need to be. They're all labeled so it shouldn't be an issue. Other then that great buy for the low price!

These may be ok in a dome light application or any application that has short or limited run time. But I used them in a license plate lamp application. That can result in hours of run time. After the first outing I noticed they were no longer working. My first thought was, fuse. But everything else still worked. Pulled them out and they were very hot with obvious scorching on one end of both LED's. Put the old yellow halogens in and they fired right up. I'll be sending these back. It would have been great, had they worked longer than a few hours.

I purchased this due to my factory antenna hitting my garage when pulling in my truck after my leveling kit. If you can install a lightbulb, chances are you'll have no problem installing this. It's a one minute job. Looks great and no noticeable loss of AM/FM signal.Update: I moved to three stars due to excessive wind noise on the highway. It almost sounds like a windy partially opening and "whistling". Still serves its purpose.

Back pain / sciatica and possibly a herniated disc in my lower back for the past 10 months. I've tried everything from Chiropractic, deep tissue trigger point massages, physical therapy and dry needling, X-rays showed nothing, I just recently got an MRI. Waiting for those results currently.Anyway, I own a 2013 3 Series BMW with sport seats that have a extremely deep bucket seat especially where the seat bottom meets the lumbar area. I specifically look for a wedge-shaped seat pad such as this thinking it would take up the gap but after a 15-minute ride this cushion has completely collapsed and does not provide the support I originally thought it would. Keep in mind I am only around 5 foot 10 inches and 165 lb.I'm sure this seat cushion works for a lot of other vehicle seats but this one does not meet my expectations on what I thought it would provide comfort and Pain Relief wise. Even when pushed as far back into the lumbar area as possible this cushion still leaves a gap under the front of your thighs which is where you need the support. I thought that the tapered cushion would go from about 3 in and taper down to nothing but I still have a gap under the front of my thighs which causes just as much pain as it does without the cushion.This particular type of foam is also very temperature-sensitive so it's hard as a rock in cold weather and way too soft in warmer weather especially when sitting on it as your body gives off a good amount of heat to transfer to any other surface it touches.I would also like to add that because of the thickness of this pad it actually raises me up a little bit past the side bolsters of the seat compromising driving and handling quality since my body weight shifts side to side and is not being properly supported by the side bolsters on the bottom and vertical sections of my seats.... unfortunately I have been looking into going to the BMW dealership and testing out there Comfort Seats for this particular vehicle and selling my sports seats which will sell to the mass population of the BMW community. I am definitely willing to sacrifice to look of the sport seats for my back not to hurt anymore. My back pain is debilitating, I am borderline ready to sell my motorcycle because I am unable to ride not to mention all other physical activities are extremely difficult as well.There's probably way more information than most people require in this post but hopefully it gets some helpful insight on what this cushion can actually be used for. This probably works for the general population of vehicles in the wide variety of seats available in today's modern vehicles but for the BMW sport bucket seats it does not meet the Mark I thought it would.J

Great fit for my 1999 Kawasaki Vulcan 500. The bike is a dual fire system so this tach works well! There were 4 wires that came off of it. I had to crimp automotive wire to the existing wires since there wasn't enough extension on them.The instructions were very simple. One of the wires I crimped a small male spade connector to and place under the female spade connector that connects into the ignition coil. Simply connect the female spade connector to the ignition coil and power is tapped without a loss in current! Its also easy to fix or remove the tachometer this way. Two power wires I crimped together and hooked them up to the rear brake light wire under the seat. The negative wire I hooked to a free ground wire under the seat. Very easy and simple and now I have a great looking and functional tach!

Must be a guy who measured this to be 7 inches, which it is not (and I'm a guy). Why the one star you ask? as you can see by the photo, it is about 6 1/4 inches long and that is including the case. The actual light is about 5 inches. Secondly in the description there are two different mounting brackets photographed and documented. Yup, you guessed it, only one bracket. On the positive side it is a solid product but I cannot get over being misled particularly when I was looking for a SEVEN inch light to fit in a defined space.

Seems to be a well built starter.  Turns my mild 351w over with no problem.  Time will tell on how long it will last.  I am using this starter with a 351w and 1998 3.8v6 t5 transmission, bell housing, and block plate.  If you use the 3.8 bell housing you need to use a 164 tooth flywheel and this starter.  You will have to grind out the starter hole in the block plate about .030  for the starter to fit.

Does not fit my '05 Avalanche 1500. Similar in design, screw mounting holes are not the same. Tried to do a return, they wanted to charge almost as much as I paid for the unit, for shipping it back to them. I ended up creatively engineering new screws,  utilizing one of the factory ones. The unit would fit fine if the screw tabs were like original equipment. It's installed, it does work, but had to tinker. Not thrilled about that really since it's advertised for a Chevy 1500, which the Avalanche is essentially a 1500 pickup with added crap to the bed.

I'm reviewing the 1-15psi Liquid Filled Gauge.This is exactly what I was looking for to install on an inline hose setup.  I have a TBI (Throttle Body Injection) and on these type of fuel systems, there are no schrader valved for testing purposes.  I like to be able to diagnose my vehicle with known factors, one of which is the fuel pressure.  The TBI is a low pressure system, which by factory, most are regulated to 9-12psi.  Although I find them to run better at 13psi.  The gauge has the perfect increments to be as accurate as I need.  If a gauge has too big a spread, such as 1-60psi, it's hard to get an exact reading for this system.I've bought 3 so far, 2 were these from Jegs.  This time I installed 1 before the fuel filter, just after the pump in the tank, and 1 after the filter, just before the TBI (see photos).  This is to further assist in diagnosing , in case the filter is playing a role in the lack of pressure.  Ethanol now in our fuel is tearing up old school setups.  Rubbers break down prematurely, unless they're specifically made for modern day junk fuel.Another great feature is the liquid filled factor.  This keeps the needle from fluctuating too much, 1 for a more accurate  reading, the 2nd, to prevent premature failure from excessive needle movement.  I should also add, this gauge is perfect for Carbureted vehicles... there is no way to check pressure besides an inline gauge.This certainly has met my needs and expectations and a great price compared to those similar in quality.I bought this from the seller "Jegs", which I feel is important to list this info. I've come across sellers with variances in their items, including knockoffs, even if listed as same brand.

As stated by many others, the packaging for shipping could be greatly improved.  It came with the bar wrapped in cardboard, but the brackets are completely exposed, wroth the paint chipped off all the edges. This will require touch up paint to prevent immediate rust, but would be easily prevented by improving the shipping method.The installation is straightforward on a 2014 Town and Country. I didn't even look at the directions. I removed the bolts holding the last two muffler hangers, then the five bolts that are used to mount the hitch. There are no bolts with the hitch, you use bolts that are already installed on the vehicle. The installation took less than an hour with the rear of the vehicle on ramps, working by myself. For my particular vehicle, I needed three different metric sockets, and a couple of swivel extentions to get the bolt above the muffler. The fit was pretty good, but the receiver is actually pushing up on the underside of the plastic bumper cover by about 1/4". This isn't a big deal, and some people may even prefer that, since it makes the receiver less visible, and shouldn't affect the function. It is also recessed from the back of the bumper a little, and it's very clean looking.

Compared to older designs (that would often kill your battery by overcharging), this model is sweet... Larger units can do an express charge faster, but then their price point is higher. Recommended for use by a home owner or amateur mechanic, and with features belonging to units that are much more expensive, easy/affordable to justify having, to keep in reserve...Follow-up [October 2016]: Schumacher has changed this model from the SC-1200A that I bought [and reviewed]. My recommendation and review is NOT for the SC-1200A-CA despite what the review title may say.My original review and 5-star rating applies to original model, not the new one.One of the reasons I got the original charger was its ability to safely handle gel batteries [like those used in UPS units, generator, etc.] - current model cannot handle those batteries, and in my case, I would drop to a 2-star rating for that omission. My current feeling is to drop rating to 1-star - current unit has much less flexibility in control. See attached photo and compare controls with current unit.Other, more expensive Schumacher units (that I cannot comment on) may be able to duplicate functionality of my 1200A...

This set may cause your rear leaf springs to sag even more, but I was still able to fit some meaty 31's on my XJ. These guys answered the phone when I had issues, which is more than I can say for the the crap from China with no customer support. Included in the package were stickers, the spacers, shackles, a key ring, and photo instructions. The photos were not of a high enough quality to be of much use, and some details were left out of the instructions (remove shocks in the rear), but the customer support put them over the top.

Just got these in the mail for my 2012 Toyota Tacoma TRD Sport Double Cap. They fit perfectly! I know it says 05 on the title, but they fit Tacoma's 05-12. These are very low profile visors and highly recommend them.

This is one of the highest quality tops available and the price point is pretty decent. The twill top is the same quality you would find on a high end import convertible. Of course, we'd all like to spend less money on the things we want, but most times you get what you pay for. The installation instructions are a bit hard to follow in some spots so we had to rely on Youtube for some installation tips. Took 3 of us about 3.5 hours to get it in place, but now that it's on, it's very easy to flip the sunroof part back and remove all of the windows.

Works great for my ATV, I have it hard wired for just plugging in when I am down plowing, then unplug and go when needed. Very simple operation and indicator lights tell you whats happening. For it being low priced but having three different options for mounting it is nice, and it is name brand.

We  got this for  our 2013  silverado.  Hubby and his brother  installed it.  Not  sure if they had any trouble  ,(they didn;t  say)  it was in good shape  when we got it.  We did have to  move the license  plate  and he has installed  fog lights  on it.  it  is  priced well

Looks good, just dark enough to still allow light through for turn signals and reflectors. I wouldnt cover your headlights up but thats up to you. There is some orange peel though, its not a perfectly smooth finish unless its streched a little

But it fit my 2011 without issue. My old filter was actually starting to smell. My Mustang is not a daily driver so I wanted to find something the might work better than the OEM style filter. I found this FRAM filter with Charcoal and Baking soda and thought I would give it a try. So far so good. I have had it in for just over a week now and my funky odor is all gone. I will give an update after I have had it in longer. For now I would recommend it. If this review has been helpful to you please vote yes.

These worked great to replace the old stock incandescent bulbs on my gauge cluster. These lights give the interior of my old 94 civic a nice modern 21st century feel. Keep in mind that these bulbs are polarized so it matters which way you put them in the socket. When I first inserted the 6 bulbs, wired up the cluster, and turned on the lights only 2 of the six worked. This doesn't mean that the other 4 were bad so don't be discouraged if the same thing happens to you. I simply had to pull them out, rotate them 180 degrees and reinsert them into their provided sockets then they all worked. I wish there was a way to tell which way is the right way in from the beginning, maybe there is and I missed it, but I just used a trial and error method. So be sure to test the lights before you put everything back together again.

The mounting adapter didn't fit on the plug without shaving the plastic down. We broke one trying to get it on. The bracket may need to be mounted next to the old bracket or connected to the old bracket. It is a good alternative to many slightly different variations of OBD mounts.Update. I have managed to work the mounting bracket onto the plug by depressing the side tabs. It was a challenge but I anticipate a more usable product.

This meter (B013PKYILS) is a great addition to your purchase of any solar panel to be able to monitor the amount of energy going to your battery or load. The voltage readings are comparable to those read withUni-T multi-meter  (B00O1Q2HOQ) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O1Q2HOQ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3I highly recommend this panel mount meter.

This is a great deal for the price. I have had one for 7 years and now I am going to purchase another one. The hinge broke on the old one, which was my fault for over-packing it. The product is actually quite durable. The lights were never hooked up and the plastic red-orange band was removed, but could have painted it. The box is quite large (41 liter?) and can hold two helmets. It will also hold a lot of groceries, including a couple of twelve packs. The lock works well and was never a problem. The keys are strong. The trunk easily removes from the rack when the lid is open, in case you want to ride without it. The mounting bracket fit easily on my Suzuki DL650 wee strom rack, but I did use some longer bolts. I added some tie downs to the trunk to carry stuff on top of it.

I'm impressed for the price - i mean they aren't DOT, and they say made in india on them, but that's a lot of decent fog light for $50. I was looking for factory USDM fog lights for my 1997 honda cr-v: turns out that factory usdm fogs for the 97 cr-v are $250+ Piaa fogs, about the same size as these.the one thing that kind of sucked was dealing with the wiring, as I've only installed 3 sets of foglights before, never with a relay. the instructions these lights come with are universal, including driving lights, with partial instructions on how to hardwire them into your headlight assembly.pictured are the usdm factory fog option for my car, and my car with these hellas mounted on the bumper, with covers and yellow shields. i love them.

I installed these on my Jeep Cherokee and they fit perfectly. They work great, and they're much better than the old sealed-beams. I installed Auxbeam LED H4 bulbs and the light pattern is perfect. This setup is so much cheaper than any other sealed-beam LED conversion and it is just as good in my opinion. I would highly recommend these.

Nice bright upgrade for a 2000 Cherokee Sport!I always hated the stock Cherokee headlights. They were never bright enough. Always left the high beams on and have never been flashed by on coming vehicles.Came across these accidently. Checked out a bunch of others and settled on these as the were the most economical at 39/pair.Some of the headlight screws were hard to get out. I think they were the original bulbs. But I managed to get it. Sprayed some contact cleaner inside the headlight plugs. They needed it. Let it dry as it is flammable. Installed the Avec's and wow! Finally, I can see on dark roads. Street signs and road reflectors can be seen from pretty far with these. These will be great to be able to see deer from a distance. A lot of deer where I drive.

Nice cover that fits well. Its tight, but not like that bed sheet that just doesnt fit.  Its the perfect size for my C7.  I appreciate the softer, felt like inside that seems like it would prevent the sand paper type rub if there happens to be some unexpected dust on the surface when covering.  My only regret is that I didn't order one with some color which would assist with putting it on easier and knowing front from back so to speak. Overall....nice product.

This is the third one I bought from stores and online. They only last one season. I am very picky about how I keep it on my seat and how I maintain it from shifting. The first one lasted one winter season in Chicago. The second one I thought would last as long, but no because it will not turn off when it hits a selected setting. The last one did not last a week and I ended up taking it to local store for trade on newer one and that one went back ina week because it died.If manufacturer would be more accommodating on warranty returns, I would promote these. However they are not interested when I contacted them regarding the ones I purchased.The material is nice, but the electronics is still sub-NASA.Would reconsider purchasing again for returning after 90 days use to get past the winter season.

I recently replaced my license plate bulbs with these LEDs.  The color difference and appearance is amazing.  The old bulbs were the dull yellow color, and these LEDs are a bright clean white.  These would be good brightness for lower to medium light applications like interior lights, license plate lights, or marker lights.  They aren't overly bright and blinding, but do provide an ample even white light.  I received these LEDs at a discount in exchange for testing and reviewing the product. I stand by my review and do not give discounted products great reviews if they do not deserve them. I count on honest reviews when making purchases as much as you do!

I'm glad someone bought this and had a review saying it fit the Ford Focus 2012-2014 models.So I bought one and I can vouch for this model Curt 11158 fits for Ford Focus 2014 SE HB.Curt even has a YouTube video showing step by step instructions on installing this hitch and included you do get picture Instructions and required tool list. Instructions says 20mins for professional and 40 mins for novice. It looks me about 35mins by jacking up the back of the car and having a person help me hold the hitch in place.I advise you to screw up the hitch and drill holes through the mount instead of marking then drilling. I love that 4 of the 6 screws go into factory bolts because it saves lots of time.I have included pictures of the finished product and it has a pretty sleek design and looks OEM because it fits very nicely under the bumper.

All of the screw holes lined up just fine. I subtracted a star because 1) when you put the dash back on, you have to lift the dash kit exterior up so they fit correctly (the dash naturally goes over them when it should go under them) and 2) There is a small empty space between the face of my receiver and the front tabs, since they are somewhat curved and my receiver face is flat.

Well here is a story that needs told. I have used this product for 2 years and it saved my 1986 Grand National last week. Took a trip of 385 miles in that awful rain two weeks ago. Changed oil the the morning I left and set out on the trip. some where during the trip I blew a head gasket and did not know I was pumping coolant in the oil. I arrived late and drove the car the next day and decided to check oil. It was awful. completely whipped brown milkshake. It is common knowledge that when this happens the motor is toast within a few miles. Drove that one hard and the following day with no sign of damage. Had to replace the head gaskets and flush the oil 6 times to get it all out but the 'ngine is fine. I drove it back home and it runs like a watch. There is only one reason only why this engine did not seize, Tuff Oil. I almost didn't put it in that day. sure glad I did.

I was worried these might be too smoked, but they're not.  They have a little smoke to the lens, and actual reflective backing inside the housings.  I think they look great.  These housings so far seem well constructed.  The retention clips are on the thicker side, so they seem sturdy and clipped solidly into the mounting brackets.  Each light housing does have two tubular vents capped with a rubber U shaped tube on them, I assume to let moisture out.  My experience with aftermarket lights with those vents is make sure there isn't any moisture in them already, then cap off those vents.  I used small vinyl thread protectors to cap them off, they fit perfectly, are $0.23 each, and can be removed to dry out the housings if needed.  4/5 since I have no longevity data yet.The videos are DRLs, regular turn, regular parking, parking with turn etc...  The left turn signal pulsing in the video is not something detectable by your eye, just the camera.Hope this review helps for any/all of these products.  I'll review each one separately.

As others have said, petcock fuel outlet is smaller than the carb fuel inlet (thus the reason for only 4 stars).  This was easily remedied by inserting a short section of 3/16" Tygon fuel line into a length of 1/4" fuel line, then hooking up the 3/16" end to the petcock and the 1/4" end to the carburetor.  Petock is function well, so far, on my 1985 Honda Big Red 250 3 wheeler.

1 of the 4 has different mounting hardware than the others.  Regular head bolts instead of allen bolts.  But more importantly I only have had time to mount 2 of these so far and after just one little rain there is already condensation inside the light.  Another Chinese knockoff failure.

This is a great product. You must understand that it is bare metal to be properly painted once you install it. It comes shrink wrapped to keep the bare metal from rusting before you use it. It is perfectly square and the end cap is welded on nicely. It worked great for several of my projects where I needed to weld it on for a winch mount.

I got these bulbs and it took me about 30 mins to install but it was my fault because it could have been 10 mins or less. Anyway, I previously had the crappy OPT7 H11 Cree Led DRL which were just useless junk. These bulbs however are very bright and it really shows on the road. I'm using these as fog light bulbs in my 2015 grand cherokee and the extra light is phenomenal. I've attach pictures since they speak better than words. The pictures with the yellowish light on top are of these fog light and my factory hid headlights in use. The picture with just the crisp white light is these lights only.Update january 2017:My passenger side bulb failed. Fine, things happen no big deal. So I've contacted OPT7 numerous times and no reply. They have no contact number and the only way to get in contact with them is through web form or e-mail but no one replies to them. Will give it another week to see if they reply then will update.Update february 2017:First I would like to apologize to OPT7 for my above comment. OPT7 did respond to me but it was not to my primary e-mail address so my mistake. They replied to every single one of my e-mails and were quick to send me a replacement bulb. However, after I got the replacement bulb and went to install it; I discovered that it may not be the bulb after all. Apparently and probably because of water, road salt and such the connector that connected to my fog light harness shorted out and destroyed the harness, capacitor and igniter for the led.After informing Opt7 about what had happened, they've promptly mailed me replacement parts which should arrive any day now. They have been very helpful during this and never once ask me about what I've done to allow this to happen or to send in proof.  I've since replaced my factory harness which was about $5 and installed my factory bulb until the replacement parts arrive.  After replacement parts arrive I'll do an update.Update 2/19/2017So the seller sent me new cables and my passenger side light is working again. And as I had suspected it was not the bulb that failed but the cord because I'm still using the old bulb even though opt7 send me a replacement bulb.  Excellent product and great customer services and would no doubt buy from them again.

They cut the interior wind tremendously. I love having my windows opened but in the X, a little too much wind was forced into my face ruining my locks of hair and drying my skin and eyes to the point I had to keep shea butter on bulk supply. No but for real they are nice quality. The same if not better quality as my Weather Tech deflectors that I have on my SAAB. I like that they are also held in with adhesive instead of friction like the Weather Tech ones are. I had to eventually double side tape my WT SAAB ones.

Perfect fit on my 2014 Tundra SR5 TRD.  I was able to reinstall the tow hooks as well.  Totally awesome looking, changed the way my truck looks from the front.  It looked good before now it looks like attitude.  I'm pretty mechanically inclined but picky as all get out.  Took every bit of 15 minutes to install.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to dress up their Tundra without breaking the bank.

As other reviewers noted, the manufacturer only supplies (4) lead wires for (6) bolt that you need to install.  Be very careful with the first four that you use for installation and you should be able to reuse at least two of them for the remaining two.  If you are NOT using a lift or ramps, you do not need to tie up the muffler after you release it from the car, just lay it down carefully on the ground (on a towel/blanket etc) as at this slight angle you won't be stressing anything.  Make it easy on yourself and at least have someone help you lift/hold the hitch in place while you attach the nuts to secure the hitch in place, otherwise this is a fairly straight forward job that you do not need to be a "mechanic" to complete.

Got this to go along with my noico butyl sound dampening material which is better then dynamat FYI. This cuts very easily and is very sticky making for a great install experience. I removed the water  vapor from my car doors and used this in its place. Granted the 80mil butyl sound dampener works much better but this product, but it really can't be compared to that because they have different purposes. I combined the two for the best outcome.

It is a great winch for the price. It was quick and easy to install. The directions are terrible, but the picture on the box made it easy enough.

This is a fine product, but it did not fit my 2002 Ford Ranger truck with the 3.0 liter engine.  The product description on the Amazon page says it fit my truck but is doesn't.  Since I had the fuel lines disconnected and I had to get the truck on the road quickly, I went to a local auto parts store to get the filter I needed.  When the cleck pulled up the fuel filter on his computer it showed two different fitters for the 2002 Ford Ranger, a 3" diameter filter, which is what I received from Amazon, and a 2" diameter filter, which is what fit my truck.  If you are going to order a fuel filter from Amazon take a look under your truck to see what size filter you need.  The filter is located on the drivers side of the truck on the frame rail under the door.

Just finished installing The Stubby in the 03 Xterra. Had to replace the OEM antenna due to damage obtained in a parking lot by an angry stranger - haha! that just gave me opportunity to buy the Stubby finally. It comes in cardboard packaging - be careful when opening the connector screw is separate from the mast itself and must be screwed on for installation. I found it easiest to use rubber pliers to ensure a snug fit while not stripping the aluminum. This antenna is strong, sturdy and feels like it will hold up in the carwash well (I will test this out and update the review once I wash my X). As far as reception I have hit a couple areas where it cuts in and out but nothing major. All in all this a great looking low pro antenna for an Xterra.*Car Wash Update*After rolling through a carwash I will say the antenna held it's own and suffered no damage.

i've been looking at these on cars and in pictures for years... even had a few sets (at least one of which was an original-esque ink-printed (non-digital) set). in the early days of dici-reproduction, it was easy to spot the difference and the printers would leave "tracks" across the surface and the digital production was easy to spot.these stickers are very, very close to an original ink-printing... except maybe they're almost /too/ clean + perfect. :) with the originals, you'd see a fish-eye or two or an errant spec... part of the process. these are flawless, but you can't fault a printer for being too precise... there's not a trace of texture on the surface (see picture) and the edges are clean with no digital artifacts, ink-spray or jaggies. the cut-contours are smooth with no odd angles. they're pristine.in fact, so nice, i'm now ordering a second, smaller set just to hang on to (and i might get another to store for a future, hopeful car)well done, SBD!

Great product. Great customer service. Looks amazing too! I received one switch DOA but the seller was very quick with responding to me and they didn't even need me to return the dead switch. They sent a replacement out asap and I was able to continue setting up all my switches for my jeep. Would recommend these switches to anyone!

Does it's job for me holding 33" tire on my Jeep TJ, sturdy, well built. I will add, that I still have stock wheels and run spacers on the wheels, I also have after market bumpers so for me I had to shim an 1/8th washer behind the wheel to clear the bumper, shouldn't be a problem with after market wheels because the offset will kick it out plenty.

Almost a decade ago, we belonged to a classic car club. In 2005, when the wonderfully intelligent folks in Washington DC decided to require that gasoline must be cut with ethanol, classic cars starting breaking down like crazy. About the same time I began to notice a loss of power and rough idling in my 2005 Mustang GT. Strange coincidence? Nope...Our mechanics found no problems... they basically told us that Ethanol sucks. To be more exact, Ethanol sucks energy out of your car by generating lots of water vapor that condenses and turns into water inside your engine as the engine cools down. This then leads to all sorts of bad things happening inside your engine including rough idle, corrosion, reduced power and a failure to easily start.Ethanol is really just a form of alcohol produced from distilling plant matter, and that alcohol picked up other decades-old particulates in the gas tanks and fuel lines of the classic cars... moving all that old junk to fuel filters and engines, causing them to clog and seize. Alcohol also breaks down plastics and many rubbers, including those used in gas and oil lines & hoses of most lawn equipment and many older vehicles. What a mess.Across the board, our club's mechanics recommended a two pronged attack on Ethanol's detrimental effects: (a) regular use of STA-BIL to remove moisture from the tank & line while stabilizing the Ethanol in the tank to minimize further moisture production; and (b) periodic application of a fuel system cleaner like SeaFoam or BG44K (our choice, which I have used every three or four months since).Our mechanic recommended using the marine version of STA-BIL in our cars, saying that it just seems to work that much better than the regular stuff (but you do pay a bit more for it). Sometimes the marine version is tough to find around here so we use the regular STA-Bil too. Since we have been using STA-BIL to remove moisture and BG44K to clean the system and enhance performance, both my Mustang and our 1930 Ford Model A seem to have run much smoother.Thankfully, the EPA has now recognized that data actually shows ethanol is not as environmentally friendly as ethanol advocates claimed it would be (surprise, surprise... look who made money on that scheme) and the EPA has cut back Ethanol requirements starting 2014. Even if the EPA gets rid of the Ethanol requirement, STA-BIL and BG44K have proven their worth to us and we will continue using them from now on.If you have something similar going on and you know it is not a mechanical issue, give this stuff a try. Totally recommended based on our experiences in the cars we have owned.Go for it.

This is a nice product and much easier than the other option of  painting the calipers. The front went on easy  I gave it 4 stars only because I was a little disappointed on the design of the clip for the rear ones they didn't go as easy as the front did, MGP could of thought this out a little better hopefully all 4 stay attached to the car, only time will tell. but overall a nice appearance, and only took about a 1/2 hour to install with the wheels still on the car.

Extremely bright headlights. Built very well. No issues so far. These mounted without having to switch any wires on my 92 chevy s10 pickup.Low beam is top row and single middle led lightHigh beam is whole light lit up. I would give 5 stars but the lens was placed upside down, and now the "TOP" stamp is upside down.

When they finally shipped after wait two days I got them 2 business days later. Not bad tho packaging was good being double boxed. Removed old shocks and had these installed in less then an hour by myself. I limited the amounts of cussing by using a jack and a 2x4 to get the bottoms in place.  Work Top to bottom last otherwise you will have a harder time like those videos on YouTube lol It made the rear end maybe 1/2 taller and feels better. My old shock were pretty soft and didn't take much to compress.

Alright about a year in with this cover and figure now is the time for a review.Look no further for your Harley Trike. This is a solid, durable cover. It holds up excellent anything New England could throw at it. No rips, tears, frays or anything. The TriGlide was outside all winter under this Covermax cover (I know, I know, I'm a horrible person) and upon removal looks no different, if not a bit dustier, then when it was put away.The cover itself still feels as it did the day I received it. Strong and pliable, and very soft on the inside. The UV rays did fade it quite a bit, but i'm not knocking a star down for that, as color was the only thing it took away. Other covers I've used in the past, a few months in the sun and they become weak and start to tear.If you're in the market for a cover for your trike (or bike even as I've never found one this durable), look no further. I'll be ordering one for my Sportster very soon.

This tool is great for threading in spark plugs.  It can be very easy to cross thread a spark plug using a wrench or ratchet.  The flexible wire handle doesn't allow enough torque to cross thread the spark plug.  So if it starts to cross thread, the flexible handle will just twist, not tightening the pug and damaging threads.  I have always used a piece of vaccum tubing over the end of a spark plug for this, but this tool is much more convenient.  This comes with 9/16",5/8",3/4" and 13/16". This is a quality tool that should last a long time.

This tool is a usable option if you do occasional work and need something inexpensive.  I would not use it if I were doing brakes all day. The tool is a nice concept - hand held, compact, etc - but it has some engineering flaws.First off, read the instructions.  The tool will probably not work out of the box.  There is an eccentric on the moving handle pivot that allow you to set die spacing and crimp pressure.  If you have it set too high, two things will happen:  1. the dies will cam over, i.e. toggle, and your flare will be off center (see my pic) 2. your tube will get crushed.  The stationary turrent die has a weak detent to hold it in place, and high pressure will cause it to move.  You don't need a ton of pressure to hold soft tubing, especially something like copper tube, or copper-nickel brake line.  Second, you'll probably want a RoFlare DF style adapter if you do double flares. You can't easily fit a standard button style flare adapter next to your tube to measure the initial stickout.You can turn the tall hex shaped towers with a wrench to fine tune the initial die alignment, however this is mostly cosmetic. This tool relies on the tube to align the die blocks. Light pressure on the die faces is required to align them right before you close the handle. Turrets need to be checked to make sure they don't toggle.  If you do all that, it makes good centered flares without deforming the tube.  It does leave light marks in softer tube, but it does not affect function.  You'll want to grease the threads on the clamp, and make sure you use the correct lube (brake fluid for brakes, etc) when making your flares.If you switch sizes - like going from 3/16 to 1/4 - you may have to adjust the cam again.  You'll also have to adjust it if you switch tube types.  This is why it's ok for home use, but not for high volume use.... too much adjusting.  The whole tool flexes when the clamp is tightened, and since it puts pressure on the edge of the die blocks, they do "splay" out. This results in a somewhat pinched tube neck just under the edge of the flare.  Again, not pretty but functional.  If I had known all this, I probably would not have bought it, but since I have it I'll use it.

I own 2 Gibsons guitars: a 2013 Les Paul Standard and a 2001 ES-335.  Both of these guitars are coated in nitrocellulose, a beautiful but somewhat temperamental finish (reacts with many chemicals). Nitrocellulose is only found on vintage and the most expensive guitars, and requires special treatment.  Many have said that Pledge furniture polish works wonders but this is a silicone containing product which is an absolute no-no for these guitars.  Many in the guitar community and professional luthiers swear by a product called virtuoso.  I agree it's a good product but ridiculously expensive.  Gibson sells a "Pump Polish" but really it's not a polish at all, but more of a cleaner only.I noticed that Zymol recently released a special guitar polish formula, and I went back to the boards to read about it and I discovered that many people have been using the car polish version with excellent results.  It is an all natural formula WITHOUT silicone. I tried it on a small area of my ES-335 and I was really impressed.  I ended up striping all the hardware and giving it a full polish up.  The guitar looks brand new!  It took some elbow grease but that's exactly what you want, something gentle to prevent you from overdoing it.  I believe this fits the bill perfectly. The best part is its relatively cheap compared with Virtuoso and Zymols dedicated guitar polish, which is most likely just a similar formula to his one.5 stars!  Great on guitars!

Have yet to use, but it's larger than I expected. It will be difficult to use in some of the more restricted spaces I have to deal with, but construction seems solid. I'm pleased that it shipped with replacement parts that will extend it's useful life.Update: have used it more than several times (truck,  lawn tractor and boat trailer bearings). This has been a real time saver. I just wish it was a way to make it a little shorter for tight spaces, but can't have everything

Even though the Escalade isn't listed on the vehicle list this bar fits perfectly. Obviously the 2 brackets that mount to the top don't fit as the Escalade has a completely different grill, but from what I've read very few people install the top brackets anyways.Sturdy enough to stand on, no play at all. I should have bought this a long time ago.

Works great for front turn signals on 2011 Subaru WRX. Flasher will be fast but "8-Pin 81980-50030 066500-4650 Electronic LED Flasher Assy Relay Fix For Lexus Scion or Toyota LED Turn Signal Light Bulbs" by iJDMToys fixes the issue. The white is really close to my factory HID headlights which is nice. I am impressed how bright these are even with the fewer LEDs compared to others. The LEDs are large which is likely why they work so great. I bought these because another brand had defects upon delivery twice. These worked even under heavy load on the alternator and did not fail. They are longer than other brands so be sure you have plenty of length / space in the light fixture.

Pros all around, but there is one con, the throttle side is just a bit too long for the KLR's throttle tube, it's a little squishy on the end but has no effect on drivability. Alas, that con doesn't override anything for me and I will keep purchasing these every time I need a set for both my KLR650 and XR650R.

Very good quality with a snug fit (as it should), but my wheel seems to be thicker than in their product photos.  There pictures show the cover touching under the thread whereas mine does does not (see my picture).  I ended up pulling too tight (leather stretches, right?) but pulled too hard and ripped out the stitches in the wheel cover itself, so it is garbage now... I am checking with the manufacturer to see if there is another option and update this review.I also agree they could give you more thread....  We are all novices with this stuff, so a little extra thread would make it less stressful....Its a good quality product, with helpful materials like the scissors, etc. but just not for my car.

In lieu of a more expensive trailer, I opted for this trailer hitch motorcycle rack and so far, it's an excellent solution:Pros:- It's easy to assemble.- Heavy paint should last a long time. (If not, a little spray paint will fix it up)- Heavy, rugged construction holds by 250lb bike perfectly. (Holds up to 500lbs)- Sensible design makes it easy to load/unload your dirt bikeCons:- Bad instructions which weren't useful. The most useful part for assembling was a simple picture. My concern was not assembling it correctly and risking dangerous conditions- The anchor bolt is a bit confusing, not even sure I'm using it properly. This is the bolt which slides into the hitch-mount part and the screw slides into. You have to bend the thing to make it hold in place for tightening down. It seems to work.Overall, I'm super happy with this setup.My dirt bike (Honda CRF230F) rolls up onto the thing, clams down with ratchet straps so it's secure.It cost the fraction of a cost of a trailer plus it's more easily stored in the garage.I'll post an update if anything goes wrong of I need to update this.Update: 7/25/2016Found my first grievance about this product: Removed one star- They include the little ramp to roll the bike up onto the rack. However, they failed to design into it a means to keep the ramp from sliding off left or right while you're rolling the bike up onto it.- The result is that often times, the ramp slips off left or right leading to dangerous conditions with a heavy bike injuring the userSuggested fix:- Slightly modify the ramp design to prevent it from slipping left or right. Something like a simple notch and channel would do the trick, or even a bolt through the center.Whatever the case, this product may be an initial version but it needs a fix for that.With two people rolling a 250lb bike up on the rack, it almost slipped of onto my buddy.

This a great product,I should have done it sooner,it makes washing out the black tank fast and painless.It is easy to install,and works great. The instructions are very limited and it says to use a 1 1/8 inch hole saw but a 1 inch will do just fine. I would suggest making a test hole in a piece of wood  first to see the fit,then go to the tank.There is a youtube video that shows how to do it that is a great help. I also put a 90 degree on the tank end and fastened the hose to it so that I had no kinks as seen in the pictures I sent in.

It worked great for a 2 week driving trip throughout Switzerland, France, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, and a bit of Germany. Basically the trip was in a big circle encompassing all of the countries, 2 days per city to give you an idea of how many stops. I preprogrammed all of the addresses before leaving on the trip. Some highways and some secondary routes.The navigation never took us on the wrong path, after reading reviews I was expecting at least one random route error. Also it would continue to work (i think it guesses) through the long tunnels, even a corkscrew tunnel! The display will dim in the tunnels, basically night mode. Some days we'd start out in an underground parking garage, it would naturally take about a minute to get the signal once at street level with buildings around. That minute seemed like forever if there was traffic, but we just drove a little slower. While it's doing that, it is grabbing the signal and display will jump around the map, then stabilize. It also asks if it should resume "from last known point" if there isn't signal.  For the most part, it kept up with short city blocks too.Several of the hotels didn't have parking, so we used the "closest parking garage" option and it was great! We didn't trust it at first a few times, our mistake, we learned to trust it.The speed camera indicators worked, just familiarize yourself with the TomToms alerts, I didn't and didn't know what it was doing at first. Posted speed limits might be inaccurate at times.We also had an iPhone with an international data plan, once or twice we would use it for a detour so i didn't have to tap the address into the TomTom. It's not hard, but the iPhone is quicker to type on, naturally. The TomTom gave a better experience than risking that much phone data over the 2 weeks.OH!  Mounting is GREAT! It's so easy! Never had a problem, we never were missing brackets and it never fell. Actually it holds really tight. I also added stickers to the bezel for quick reference, see photos.I took off a star, they don't have a map of Iceland. So I have to find another solution. Searching shows they have been working on it for 4-5 years, taking a while.

This Universal bumper does not really fit well on a Nissan D21 Hardbody truck (1986 to 1997). That truck ran for 11 years. You'd think someone would make a bumper that fit it nicely.My Amazon experience with this has been horrible.

You can't just take those off. I took this Receiver hitch to a local truck accessory shop that specializes in mounting bumpers and receiver hitches. They verified this was the correct part through CURT, but they could not get it on either.

This jack is well built at 33#.  The screw Drive is smooth and the included tool is large enough to give you the leverage you need to lift a full size Motorcycle. The 2 adjustable frame standoffs screw up and down to adjust for any offset in the bikes frame, and they also are completely removable if you have a sturdy flat surface like the 3 mm thick Skid plate on a Yamaha Super Tenere XT1200Z or BMW_1200_GS.

We have the 22 inch blade on the passenger side wiper for our 2015 F150 truck - just FYI the F150 takes the 22" wipers on both sides, but not every vehicle has same size wiper blades. I had recently replaced both wipers with a pair from Rain X and wasn't unhappy with them. However, I think I actually like this one better after using one of each at the same time for a week now.This one installed in just a minute or two with no drama at all - just snapped on and done. There's a neon green cover over the actual wiper blade to remove and that's it. The blade sweeps across the glass smoothly and quietly with no streaking or missed spots. It doesn't bounce or stutter or squeak going down the road either. Hopefully this wiper will last two years or longer like the original ones that came on my truck.

You can not go wrong for the price, needed a smaller bar to fit in my lower grille and after owning a 30 one I was worried that the light output simply wouldnt be enough for the price, I was very wrong. This small light performs exceptionally well and is very nicely made, I cant believe it was so affordable. Will update this if any problems develops!

I installed these on my Kubota Zero turn mower.  They are very bright and look great.  I have not had them long enough to determine how they will hold up.  They are aluminum cases and look to be of very good quality.  I am very happy with my purchase.

Works great. The part that goes into the tailgate did not install like the instructions said it would. I had to use vise grips on the expanding nut to keep it still while using a wrench to expand the nut. Other than that, everything works great.

I searched hi and low for a socket rail.  I looked on eBay & Amazon & seen many different types.  But none, that had it all in one.  Lots of room for an entire socket set, security & peace of mind that you won't loose your expensive sockets, the ability to add more sockets to a rail through the use of extra clips & also a hole to hang them on a wall organizer.  I was skeptical about getting this at first because I thought to my self, "How is a plastic rail going to lock in metal sockets?  Lol!"  I figured there must be some obvious truth to that.  Especially seeing that these are made in the USA & have lifetime warranty.  Another review of a different model of this rail is what actually made me decide to get these.  Which was the fact this rail can hold my entire SuperKrome socket set which is 6mm-24mm with no sockets missing on one rail.  There isn't enough clips to fit that many sockets, but there is enough room on the rail to hold that many.  So I had to purchase an extra set of clips, which I haven't received yet, to accommodate the 23mm & 22mm socket.  So those aren't shown in the pic I posted.  Aside to that, I was pretty surprised that the sockets really held securely.  I even tried to pull on one to see if it would come off, and it wouldn't.  Which was a locked one.  The plastic locking clips aren't your ordinary plastic.  They seem to be pretty close to the plastic used in the back of flatbed trucks.  I kinda feel like, now if I go to a junk yard, I'll be showing off.  Lol.  I am very happy with these and will be recommending them to anyone I know.

Ordered 2. The first one out of the box installed perfect, works great. Opened the next box to install the second unit. The motor that opens the vent was dangling and could not be re-attached as it was ripped right off the base. Screen had a hole in it. Frame was damaged. Bag holding mounting screws was cut open and screws all over the bottom of the box. Didn't count to see if there were even all there. Just returned the whole mess. So 3 stars for a good product, but minus 2 stars for crappy QC. I already removed the old fan and tossed it off the roof. Now I'm hoping to get a new unit before the weather hits the 14x14 hole in my roof.

Amazing....installed these on my 2010 C14 Concours as a replacement for the factory " city lights" they look great and match my LED headlights which are 6500k. Simple installl by removing the front faring chin panel over the front fender.I'll update on durability of the new LED's the lights I removed were orriginals that were still operating hope these can last another 7 years. and 65,000 miles.

TPI (20 pcs) 1/2"-20 Premium Chrome Closed Bulge Acorn Wheel/Lug Nuts, B403542HT-20, 1.4" Tall, 3/4" / 19mm Hex Size - I can't see how I can give anything less that 5 stars on this review.

I've included a photo of them installed, sorry no before and after but take my word for it....HUGE difference!

I used this to seal a car trunk that had water running the door  gasket and into the ribs that hold the gasket to the metal.  That resulted in the water coming out at the lowest point into the trunk.  It is runny so make sure you tape off or cover things it could drip on... it also required me to be fast and operate in sections.... NO LEAKS now though.It dries a hard dense rubber so you won't be pulling it off and putting it on.... it is not a flexible gasket feel.I had some left over... so...1) I did glue a sole back onto some sneakers... put it in the clamp over night to dry and it has been great for weeks.2) It says it is electrical compliant.. I had a car USB charger I bought on Amazon that fell apart in our hands before we ever used it.  The plastic clips that held it to the metal plate broke... I used this rubber to glue the two together... knowing it should not create short.  It worked Great glueing the plastic to the metal.Shelf life... you can see in my photo that I had some dry chunks after about 3 weeks of post use sitting.It skims over quickly so you want to get your bond before that happens.

I needed to replace a halogen bulb on my 2011 Harley-Davidson Street Bob. My headlight housing requires a H4 bulb. 9003 is equivalent to H4 and will meet your H4 requirements. The MotoVision bulb is definitely brighter than the stock bulb I replaced but that could be because the stock bulb was 4+ years old, not sure. I also have not tested this on the road yet due to the current weather (Northeast in March 2015). I will try to update the review when I do. As for the orange reflection feature, I can see an orange tint at some viewing angles, but I do not notice it when looking head on. Also there does not seem to be any orange tint on objects the light shines on. I'm not sure if I will be able to tell if the orange reflection makes me more noticeable because it will be hard getting feedback from oncoming traffic. We might just have to take their word for it. That said, the MotoVision is bright enough for me and there is a noticeable difference between the high and low beams to make me happy so far. Like I said, I will try to update the review once I get my bike on the road.

I have a 2006 Harley Davidson Sportster 1200 Custom which is in the listed compatible bikes.  Let me tell you, it took less than 5 minutes to put the new bulbs and covers on my bike, all the right parts in all the right places.I gave this product only 4 stars for one reason....  they are barely smoked out, you can still easily see the bulb with the bike turned off.

A few minor molding defects in the rubber texture, but overall a good value. The mat dimensions are almost perfect, and it is a heavyweight rubber that should provide excellent protection.

We installed this approximately 1 1/2 years ago on a 1965 CJ5 we are rebuilding and it has already fallen apart. The Jeep has almost no miles on it so it would appear the rubber mixture has issues. Omix-ADA has offered to replace it and some other parts but how long will they last? The air cleaner hose and transfer case boot also cracked.

There is nothing confusing about the instructions with these bars. I do not understand the other reviews unless the product instructions have changed. It took 55 minutes total time to install these, but I did use a small electric impact driver on the nuts. You need 5/8 and 19 millimeter sockets. 16 millimeter should be the right one but is often not in a tool set. A 5/8 spark plug socket is great. I did accidentally swap two of the brackets. The rear bracket is different than the front / center. Be sure to check those out. They were clearly stamped on the side of each bracket. I just missed that and had to swap adding about 5 minutes to the install. Just put everything on loosely including the running board then tighten the lower holes that go into the truck and everything will work out.Some more expensive bars have an extra brace that runs from the bottom out to the bracket. That would make it more firm but these are fine.Pre-assembled the clear washers on to the brackets so you don't drop them in the frame and pre-stack the lock washers and washers onto the bolts. That will save you time.The clear bag brackets are driver side and green bags are for passenger side.

I recently received my Motor Trend FlexTough 2 Tone Rubber Car Floor Mats in black and gray from Amazon. I was surprised at just how heavily made these mats were. At less than $30, these mats were a great deal. I have seen mats similar to these at the big box stores sell for twice this price. These mats are all rubber. No carpet inserts in them so they are easily washed. The mats are extremely heavily made. I was really shocked. I wasn't expecting anything this heavy for that price. The mats do have lines around the edges where you could cut them and still look good. I opted, for now, not to cut them. I wanted to give them time to kind of fit themselves to my car. I have a 4 wheel drive Blazer, and of course, there is that hump in the passenger side floor that makes floor mats a little difficult to fit. The mats that came with the Blazer are carpet and I really don't like messing them up. The previous owner had clear rubber mats on the floors but they looked pretty bad, so I replaced them with these Motor Trend mats. The mats have a beefed up section where the accent color is to give you that little extra padding. I also like the fact that the accent colored part is smooth. Since I wear work boots on days I have to work, I don't have any problem with my heels getting caught on and ridges that are parallel with the dash. These are a great set of mats. They look better than most of the high dollar mats that come with new cars.  I received these great mats at a discount for my unbiased testing and review. If you need a great set of mats, then look no farther.

So I replaced my lower ball joints with Moog and didn't line up the hole for the grease fitting exactly right inside the lower control arm.  So using the ones that came from Moog were short and my grease gun couldn't connect properly.  Using these makes that connection work now.  Yeah.

This made a huge difference on all the plastic and trim on my truck. I used it on a black 2012 GMC Sierra Denali that sits in the sun most of the time. The truck isn't very old and the paint is still in great condition but the trim always stuck out. The trim also had wax on it that I could never get out. I've tried different trim restorer products, "back to black," trim cleaners, etc and none of them ever worked. This stuff is almost more of a stain and right away turned the trim back to a nice dark black. Did all the trim and seals on the truck in about an hour and used less than 1/4 the bottle.

I love this stuff. If you apply an amount to a microfiber towel and rub it on the car, afterwards using a dry microfiber towel to buff your car; this stuff will make your car look brand new off the lot. It covers most smaller scratches and rock chips and almost makes them disappear completely. Its a shame they stopped selling it at my local stores so I had to come online to find it! (That's how great it is!)I've attached a photo of my car after washing and applying the product to show the shine it creates. (Notice the mirror like reflection it produces)

I used this to remove crank pulley bolt on 1996 Toyota Avalon. There were no 8mm1.25 bolts included which I needed. I tried with the included dowels and one of them broke. It held fine with bolts but bent the bolts. I used black and also grade 8 bolts both bent. I think the metal dowel damaged the outer threads too. I would buy again because I may use it for the cam pulleys another time. For this car there is a better model specific holder available the same price as this universal one. I wish I had that one. Also I did not fully tighten the bolts to the pulley, I will check the length I need to just go through the pulley and not stick out the backside. I will use washers and keep the tool tight against the pulley to avoid bending bolts. Also I had to use a clamp spreader to hold the tool's arm perpendicular to the pulley.

Awesome product to follow up with after M105. Leaves a mirror finish. I'm used to CG products though which always smell pleasant so I don't really care for Meguiars flammable smell their cutting polishes seem to have. But I'd never dock stars for something as unimportant as smell. It does it's job well.

I bought two of these for our cars on the basis that they seem like a good idea in theory, and that they probably couldn't hurt anything. The former probably still holds true; the latter very nearly didn't.The repair manual for my wife's car states a torque of 28 ft-lb for her drain plug. Mine says 30 ft-lb, but I always just set my torque wrench to the same as for my wife's so that I'm never in danger of forgetting which is which and accidentally over-torquing one of them.Installation on her car went smoothly enough, with the usual level of excitement involved in an oil change. I tightened up to the usual "click" without thinking twice about it.On my car, the plug's thread stripped well below the torque expected of the OEM plug. I set 28 ft-lb as always, started torquing, and never got to the point where the wrench clicked. I knew something was wrong from the feel of it; instead of feeling a steadily increasing force, this peaked very early and then dropped off in that sickening way that usually only means one thing. Backing out the plug, my fears were proved right.From the feel of it, I doubt I made it to half the torque that's expected for the OEM bolt before the thread stripped. I'm basing that on the feel of the torque applied when installing new spark plugs, which is about half of that specified for the drain plug.At first I thought I'd damaged the oil pan, but I did get the old OEM bolt up to torque after cleaning out the pan's threads and flushing with a quart of oil. At first glance it appears no damage was done, but we'll see how this affects things in the long run.I'm willing to grant that It's possible that these plugs expect a lower torque than the manufacturer's bolt. However, there's no mention of that anywhere to be found either on the packaging or on Gold Plug's website. If these are supposed to be installed at a lower torque, then I'd expect that information to be written clearly on the packaging in 30-foot letters of fire (or something similarly eyecatching).To be fair, the magnet on the tip of the plug does appear to be quite strong. It's sufficiently so that it makes getting the plug into the oil pan a bit of an embuggerance; the magnet wants to grab a hold of the steel pan at every chance it gets, pulling the plug off centre from the hold. It badly wants iron hugs, and seeks them out at every opportunity.I suppose the plug did have one saving grace: the magnet caught the majority of the bits of the plug's threads that stripped off, which was very considerate of it. If only all abject failures cleaned up after themselves so thoughtfully; nice touch, that!

First, getting the suction cups into their places on the mount proved challenging. Considerable force is needed, as is finger dexterity. When you mount the light housing to the mount, screw the bolts in tight; otherwise, they will quickly come loose. Hand-tighten them as tight as you can.Other than that, they are bright little lights. Good bang for the buck. I don't anticipate them lasting longer than 1 year, due to the fact that the light housing cover is entirely plastic. It might not take the Texas summer too well.It'd be nice if the power cord was longer; my truck's 12v DC outlets are near the floor.

Installed in class A RV (30 Amp Service).  Used 100 amp shunt.  Wired with 22/4 stranded alarm wire purchased at home depot for .30 cents per foot.  Mounted flush adjacent to rv systems control panel.  Unit works as advertised and I am very pleased.  Another reviewer mentioned using a DPDT swith to use one meter to monitor both charge and discharge readings.  Sounds like a good idea to me.  I will update after I install the switch.  For now, I have the meter measuring discharge.  Wish I would have bought this years ago.Update 14 Feb 2017:  I installed a double pole double throw (DPDT) on-off-on switch.  This allows one meter to measure discharge or charge rates (or measure voltage only in the off position).  Works perfectly.  Just wire the switch to swap the two conductors hooked to the shunt.  In my case this was the green and white wires.  For info only....your situation may be different.Update 6 Apr 2017: For what it's worth, my generator draws a max of 79 amps (momentarily) when cranking the starter. So the 100 amp shunt is adequate for my rv. The generator starter is my highest 12 volt house battery draw. Using this monitor, I've learned having my rv plugged in to shore power, while the use/store switch is in the "store" position will cause about a 13 watt constant power drain. If I disconnect the shore power, the draw goes to zero. I don't know why this is. But, its nice to know and explains why I had low batteries a few times in the past.

Put a set of these on a 2013 Toyota FJ Cruiser with a 3 inch coilover lift. If you have a lifted Fj you know how much the handling changes after you lift it. Mine walked all over the road after the lift was installed due to the ball joints being at such a bad angle. These bad boys bring the caster back into spec, and bring back the handling that is lost when lifting the Fjs. The instructions are very thorough, some mechanical aptitude is needed for sure. The seller had these on my door step in about 4 days! I highly recommend these!!!

I bought 4 of these tires for my Camry in March of 2015 . Today is July 19th, 2017. Currently, I'm sitting in Walmart getting the second one replaced within a week and a half of the first one. Both tires have less than 20k miles and both formed knots from broken belts internally. I've heard these tires used to be made in Korea and were good tires. Production has been moved to China and they're crap now. I replaced both tires with AMERICAN made Douglas tires, including lifetime balancing and rotation, for less than two of these junk tires cost here.Buyer be warned.

Washing a car is both an art and a science, and this Starter Wash and Dry Kit from Griots takes a lot of the guesswork out of the equation. I've done a LOT of research on car washing and by far the most recommended solution is the "Two Bucket Car Wash". There are videos out there detailing it. The problem with this kit is that it really doesn't give you everything you need.While there's a microfiber detailing mit in the kit, you really need 2 mits (one for the top of your car and another for the undercarriage) you can&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/pick-them-up-pretty-cheap-on-Amazon/dp/B00R54ULN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">pick them up pretty cheap on Amazon</a>. The mit in the kit is a good one, but it works much better for interior than exterior.The bucket is of nice size and it has a grate at the bottom which is very important. as it'll trap dirt as you go and keep the dirt from scratching your car as you work. I like that there's a cap in the grate to easily measure how much of the wash to put in. It's very handy! The bucket/ troff is on wheels and is well constructed. There's an additional grate that you can put on top of the bucket so you can your mit on it while working. It's too bad the bucket isn't divided into 2 sections as it's helpful to be able to wash and then rinse one after another.The microfiber drying towel is excellent, and is a better alternative to the leaf blower dry that's recommended in "Two Bucket Wash" (a little bit of overkill).Also there's no foam or foamer like the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Gilmour-Foamaster-II-Cleaning-Gun-Sprayer/dp/B000Y190WE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Gilmour Foamaster II Cleaning Gun Sprayer</a>&nbsp;which is key to the Two Bucket Wash. Having said all that, what you do get is quality. I just wish it was really an all in one solution.

Great gauge for a great price. I have been trying to get a replacement temp gauge for the past couple of weeks.. no one had the exact one so I had to settle for this one. I expected to have to rewire it to work but to my surprise the connections were identical.  The only thing missing was the chrome bezel but I can live with it. I posted a picture from the rear so people can actually see what there working with before you order it.

I installed this in my 2007 Mazda 3 Hatchback with a Kenwood receiver.  This is a reasonably priced kit, but ultimately, you get what you pay for.The plastic is cheap, the instructions were poor, the color doesn't completely match the dash, and there is a small gap between my climate controls and the bottom of the kit (nothing horrible, but I notice it).  I could not get the double din trim plate to fit my Kenwood without pushing the receiver back, so I just left it off, but it looks alright.  Also, I have an automatic climate control system and the kit does not accommodate the LCD panel, you only receive a display replacement pocket, so I will need to custom mount the LCD panel.Overall, this kit works but I would prefer to spend more money for a higher quality product.Pros:InexpensiveEasy to install (once you figure out the instructions)Cons:Cheap plasticPoor instructionsDoes not accommodate climate control LCD panelGap between kit and climate controlsColor and texture do not fully match

I only needed a T20 tamper-proof bit.  But that's today.  I'm sure in the future I will need some other obscure bit, so when I saw $13 for 100 security bits, I figured I'd get something that "at least works once."  I was pleasantly surprised when I received this little case of bits!Only one little guy escaped in transit; the rest of the bits were in their proper places, so reorganizing them was a cinch.  All of the holes for the star/torx/hex/etc. tamper-proof bits appear to be dead-center, or near enough as makes no difference.  The extension is nice because my other one broke, so bonus there.  All-in-all this is a fantastic value.  If you need one, get them all!  You almost certainly will need another down the road.  Worst comes to worst, you have some extra regular bits in your arsenal.  Good job Neiko!

They fit our 01WJ. Ordered two packets and replaced them all... you will need two sets!Definitely not plug and playTook about an hour, had to assemble and then after trying them, only two worked, then one at a time had to rotate and play with the connections till they finally worked...Very happy with final result!

Leveled out nice, looks great! Front is 1/2 lower than the rears measuring floor to upper wheel well, I'm good with that for when I tow. Fought getting the strut back in but it will go, I put the top in first then pushed hard on lower arm. Don't need to remove the lower strut bolts but might have been easier. The top A arm will be a pain reconnecting, I used ratchet straps. It looks like it's wrong because the A arm hits the coil, but don't worry once it's back together and on the ground the A arm will go back into proper place under the trucks weight. ONLY issue is it should come with washers for the 3 upper bolts (allen heads) to mount the strut back in. I had some on hand.

They are great. Need more blue than white but would have sacrifice viability. The quality looks top notch, packaged great, came with quartz tube protection but wish they had color filament tubes.  Brightness is way better than stock & so is distance, what street cat claims is proven. Fans in the light assambly are great & quiet than others I returned. Highly recommended

High quality LIGHT SMOKE. This is a tinted cover, but not as dark as some I have owned. However, the good side is that you get a clean custom look, but aren't dark enough to upset cops.Great product!

I was excited to use this product on my Camaro SS but it had an issue. The spray nozzle was faulty. It would spray water from the twist flow control. I ended up getting more wet then the car.  I know that handle was faulty but did not want to complain since it was not good quality anyhow. It is practically a metal handle with a orange plastic clamped on it. I went to Home Depot and bought a red soft handle with better quality which worked like a charm. Do yourself a favor and upgrade the handle if you purchase this. After that its a great item.

I bought these and was shipped an aftermarket part not a genuine VW part. they are not OE quality coils. The part numbers were not the same. they are light weight and plastic is cheap. one out of four even arrived broken. I paid OE prices for a generic part that came broken.I wouldn't buy these coils again.

Once I finally recieved the magnet I was disappointed. This decal is poorly made. It is simply a scratched up large black magnet with a piece of blue vinyl stuck to the center. The blue line was placed on the magnet with a slight curve rather than straight through. There were scratches and pin holes poked on both the black magnet and the blue decal, there was no damage at all to the packaging it was shipped in

I got this to install a single DIN Kenwood deck in a 2010 GMC Canyon (=Chevy Colorado). My past experience with Metra kits has been good.Positive aspects include the pocket (helpful in a standard cab pickup), and overall finished look.Negatives, though, are more than I would have expected based on previous experience.* First, the instructions really require a lot of close examination because of the number of vehicle and deck combinations supported by the kit. Nor does the manual indicate what the difference would be between a plain DIN installation versus an ISO DIN installation. I had to figure it out online.* Second, the mounting ear on the right side is VERY fragile. The left side one is quite strong, with a solid 1/8" of plastic supporting it, but the left has much less. I nearly broke the left side off seating the deck into the frame. I ended up using 2-part epoxy and some fiberglass mesh (from a body kit I had around) to reinforce it. Otherwise, I think it would have broken off on any kind of rough road. See the photo for what it looks like. Fortunately, it's not visible, but definitely a disappointment.* Third, the rear of the deck needs more support, as at least one other reviewer has noted. (The factory radio has as plastic post that engages a metal slot in the dash.) I used some cardboard spacers wedged between the deck and the pocket to give some support, but Metra should have some kind of peg or support to help out.As you can see from the photos, it looks good installed. I just wish it were better than what it is.

I bought this filter for my 2001 VW Golf TDI.  I was impressed with the quality of this filter.  It was manufactured in Germany.  It fit perfectly in the air box and had a nice good seal.  This is the "cold climate" filter which I prefer because I have removed the snow screen which can get restricted over time if not cleaned.  Having this extra layer on the filter eliminates the need to have the the snow screen.  Amazon was great to deal with.  They have fast service and great prices.

Nice solid hitch for my Honda Element 2006.  Went on pretty well, had to tap one " bolt through unibody- had issues with the included U Bolt, as it would not go through the two pre drilled holes in the hitch. Had to hammer the U Bolt together a bit so it would fit, which did ding up the threads a bit- causing a hassle to get nuts to thread on.  Also, you will need a  LONG socket- or a small adjustable wrench to snug up those " Flanged Hex Locknuts because a regular socket will not reach all the way up.  Nice hitch cover came with it.  :)

This generator arrived in 3 days, drop shipped from Smarter Tools in Virginia, via one of the big box stores at a significant savings. I found out they also carry them in the stores.It comes with a 400 cc bottle of no name (literally) oil, a spark plug wrench, and a screwdriver. A 12 v charging cable is included. There is a USB charging port.In addition to a Smarter Tools manual, there is a Yamaha engine manual and a Quick Start Guide. There is no funnel. You'll need a narrow one, or one with a flexible neck.I chose to use my own Mobil 10w-30 using only 300 cc. 400 cc is called for in the specs. You can look at the oil level by opening a small port on the one side (no tools), but the access for filling or changing is so much easier by removing the side panel, unscrewing 2 captive screws at the top. The panel hooks onto the lower part of the frame. I also checked the air filter and moistened it with oil.The engine and muffler are Yamaha marked, and there is a Made in China sticker on the engine/inverter inside.I like the construction: it seems solid and looks so much like the Yamaha EF2000is (check out the maintenance videos on youtube). In every detail with small differences, they are like brothers, if not twins.I started this in 1 pull, much like when I started my tiny by comparison 700/800 watt Earthquake IG800W inverter generator.It's very quiet, maybe slightly quieter at idle on Smart Throttle (ECON mode in other generators) than the little Earthquake. Of course this has a lower tone, with twice the displacement. I don't know how it compares to the Honda EU2000i, but it is probably a bit louder than the Honda, due to the smaller displacement (Honda has a 98 cc engine), and the need to rev higher under load. The sound levels I measured were: quietest was on grass with Smart Throttle on, no load: 53 dBA (iPad app) at 23 feet. On concrete, 57 dBA no load. Loudest was on concrete, 63 to 64 dBA, Smart Throttle off under a Haier 6,000 BTU A/C load (4.5 amps/540 watts running). It was 61 dBA with the ST on.It is best to get the compressor of an A/C (and probably a refrigerator) running before switching to Smart Throttle ON mode: if you cycle the A/C cool off then on again, the generator will sag and overload, not having time to rev up the amps to get the A/C running in time. So if you run an A/C, start with Smart Throttle OFF, leave the A/C on COOL and low fan and turn the Temp down to keep the compressor from cycling off and on. Then you can switch to Smart Throttle ON to quiet the generator.I had no problems running a variable speed drill or a 500 watt halogen lamp. I probably won't stress the generator much before I break it in for 20 hours, when I will change the oil and then up the wattage. You might be able to run a 13,500 BTU RV A/C with 2 of these units in parallel.I like the Yamaha connection, and I think it is mostly a Yamaha design with possible licensing of the electronics and inverter. This engine has a 500 hour EPA rating.I like the parallel capability, something that you can grow into.I will upload a review on to Youtube under my m60mgman name. Just search for AP2000iQ.If I encounter any issues I'll update this review. At this time, I highly recommend the Smarter Tools AP2000 iQ inverter generator. It's quiet, easy to start, seems to have the power to run what I want it to, and you can buy another one when and if you need more power without needing 2 people to lift it.Edit 6/28/2014I have broken the unit in with 20 hours of use, and changed the oil.So how much load can this unit handle?It can handle 1600 watts, and maybe a little more. Then the Overload light blinks, and it sags, and goes into a low output mode, 110 volts and no more than about 1380 watts. Then you have to unplug everything, stop then restart the unit.Then it will be reset. I could not get anywhere near 2000 watts peak. Not that the peak is critical, but I do like to be able to get every watt I'm promised. It does seem to run close to or at 1600 watts.I never intended to run it at 1600 watts anyway, but there is no overhead with my sample even if I wanted it.So it is a decent price for an inverter generator with 1600 running watts and parallel capability. Just don't expect it to deliver any more than that.Downgraded to 4 stars for inability to deliver advertised peak output.

Faring went on very easily, it took me and another maybe 10 minutes to get it on straight. I was very pleased to see Inno included 4 clear vinyls to put on your roof to prevent the faring feet from scratching the paint. I have experienced little to no noise or rattling from this product, and it adds a nice look to your car. The Inno sticker that comes on it is also very easy to get off if you don't want it on there. I mounted this to the Subaru OEM roof rack on my 2011 STI hatch.

I put a new electric start engine on my old mower that was originally recoil start only.  I needed a cheap battery and this was about the best deal I could find.  Arrived fully charged, I put it on my Shumacher smart charger and it showed fully charged. Mine doesn't look anything like the picture, it's yellow. Came with some brackets/stand offs that can be screwed into the battery's terminals.  Has + & - terminals on both sides with plastic plugs in them so you can pick which side of the battery you want the to attach the wires to.  Also came with a little plastic bracket that clips onto the bottom, I assume this is some kind of mounting bracket, though it's not secure enough to be the only mount in any kind of mobile application.  I'm pleased so far, and it cranks my new 190 CC Briggs & Stratton 875 with ease.

LOVE IT! The coloring was amazing and so easy to figure out which wire where it goes. I needed a wiring harness for my 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer and it worked perfectly. It took me 7-8 minutes wiring the cables and 1 minute to hook  up my ground cable. This is my first time installing stereo! So I was pleased with how easy it was. I just used electrical tape to secure the connections. NOTE: This harness has extra wires for speakers etc that aren't needed, so don't think you missed anything.

worked like a charm on my 2007 toyota Rav4 V6.  i was a little bit worried when i pulled the originals and they were a different Denso part number.  But previous reviewers said it worked in their Rav4 V6 so i tossed them in.  I've had them in for a week and they've been running great.  i also replaced my ignition coils at the same time, and immediately noticed an improvement in acceleration.  this was probably more due to the 11 year old ignition coils being replaced (at 142k); but i'll take what i can get.  I do believe there is a special ring in Dante's Inferno for the Toyota engineer who decided you have to take apart the entire air intake system on the Rav4 just to change the spark plugs.  and good luck trying to get a socket extension on the plugs in the back of the engine compartment facing into the firewall.

The Avalon has 3 O2 sensors so do plenty of research on which one of your codes it pointing too. This sensor is connected on the catalytic converter and resolved (P1150 & P1155)  2 of the 3 codes that I had on my car. I did purchase the other Denso 02 Sensor 234-9021 which resolved my other engine code P1135.  I will say that this is the best price available anywhere compared to Advanced Auto Parts or Autozone, so please save your money and buy this from Amazon. The sensors should be the same for the 2nd Gen Avalon's (1999-2004) so this will guaranteed fit on your Avalon.Key things to know for the replacement of this sensor, remember to disconnect the ground terminal off battery, you will need a O2 sensor tool to remove the old one and install the new one and the passenger seat has to be un-bolted to disconnect the sensor and run the sensor through the small hole.

This battery worked just fine for almost two years. I bought it on March of 2016, and installed it. You would think it shouldve lasted a bit longer, but no. The mechanic at the Chevron where I work said the battery had a bad cell. Well I dropped the original 5 star to 4. Because the battery didn't last as long as Id hoped, but it lasted long enough.

2004 Silverado . . . someone said it doesn't fit, and it doesn't.  Here are some problems...1) The outer ring of the hinge on the tailgate sits flush to body of the tailgate.  There isn't room for the lock band.  With a screwdriver and hammer, and maybe loosening the bolts to the tailgate, you can make some room.2) The bends in the lock band will not slip around the outer ring of the tailgate hinge.  You can rebend the lock ring so the straighter side is even straighter, or even bent back a little more than that, so it can slip by that slot you made to solve the first problem.  Then you need to adjust the bends on the other side so the holes in the band line up so the lock will grab both of them.3) You can't install the lock band like in the video.  Instead, leave the tailgate closed and slip up from below.4) You'll find the band will slip into an unusable position unless you put that included washer between the band and the tailgate.5) After all of that, you'll find that the lock body hits the tailgate mounting bolts (one on the tailgate, one on the truck body) so you can't close the tailgate.So, it doesn't fit.  However, I had a small Master lock that I could hook through the band holes, and doesn't hit when I close the tailgate, so I think it's now secure.  I took this picture and then covered the keyhole with electrical tape to keep out the elements.  (And for some reason the photo insists on being sideways...sorry about that.)Epilogue - purely coincidental I'm sure, but now the tailgate won't open!  I dug into the latch and found that one of the plastic clips that holds the latch rod is totally brittle and fell apart.

We loved our first set of FH Group Leatherette seat covers that we had on our 2014 Kia Soul that we decided we had to get some more for our 2016 Kia Soul. A few after they've been installed the seat covers really start to conform to the car seats. Most people are surprised that these are not factory leather seats.Installation Tips: Rather than struggle with trying to tie the loops under the bottom of car seat I found it much easier to use two small black zip ties to tie them loops together. Of course I snipped off the excess. Also, the head rest doesn't seem to fit well on Kia's so with this set I actually sewed them together to make a tighter fit. I have photos showing the before and after of the headrest. Another added feature of the FH Group seat covers is the map pockets. Kia Souls don't come with them so this is a nice touch for junk that would end up on the floorboard.

Ordered a 15.5 in for my E450 Motorhome.  I heated it up for 5 minutes with a blow dryer per instructions,  it was a tight fit , but not overly difficult to get on.  The cover is shipped folded in half, it appears a little deformed when you first look at it.  After installing it the deformities disappeared.  I really like it.

Here are some photos of what this looks like mounted in 3 different family cars.  The cutter design is nicer than the original LifeHammer.  But unfortunately this new version is Made in China and the plastic handle is actually hollow, and you can see the gap in the seam where the two halves of the handle are snapped together.  I guess this hollow construction helps keep it light weight so it is less likely to fly out of the grip of the holder during an accident.I wanted something better built than a toddler toy for my own car, so I also bought the BLACKHAWK! HawkHook Silver Handle Knife - Serrated Edge, which is smaller than this one.  The HawkHook is a "pro" pocket-size emergency window breaker and seatbelt cutter popular with police and paramedics.

The hose was ripped and brand new. not a hole that maybe one could not see, completely ripped.But....  Not sure what you could actually do with the hose anyway its so short and junk.  My regular dump hose fits, so I will use that, they should loose the storage compartment full of junk pieces, and it would actually be a quality tank.

Works perfectly. It's designed to work with the rear seats at their OEM angle, so if you've installed bracket spacers to lean the seat back it will be touching the back of the chair. Wasn't an issue for me though. I just bent the brackets forward about 3/4" after I mounted them so they didn't rub the seat.

Works well but not for a 2016 Sabura XV Crosstrek. These bulbs had to much resistant that it blew my fuse which was on the same board as the starter switch so it wouldn't let me start my car. I had to spend $600 to get it to the dealership to have them find the issue.The brake light for the Subaru is a 7443CK so I don't think this is.SO BE WARNED!!I will be returning this for a refund.

Fits very easy, the steering wheel looks nice, cons: It says "Protects hands against hot and cold EXTREMES" that is not even close one day was 68 and my hands were sweating, another day in the morning was 35 and the cover was cold, so I give 5 stars anyway because of the style, but if you want something weather proof buy a memory foam, I have one and the weather doesn't matter and you feel like the steering wheel was made of cotton.

Better than 3m 1080 and dinoc, more realistic. You really need to plan what you are wrapping to get the most out of the vinyl. If this is your first time using Vvivid's vinyl (it was my first time using their vinyl) Then you may notice that it's easy to apply and the air release technology is there. However: in some applications I feel like the adhesive is a tad weaker than 3m or oracal, not a huge deal, but it does make a difference in tight corners. This vinyl looks the most realistic at a distance and around curved surfaces. Use the tech art carbon for interiors for the most realistic look. This is great on spoilers, lips, and smaller things. I feel like the bigger the surface area, the less realistic it looks.It has a nice semi gloss coat and mild texture, unlike dinoc/1080. The carbon weave is fantastic, and definitely is high quality. This is my go to carbon vinyl for most projects. Don't hesitate to try it. It's cheaper than most of them out there.

I got them and put them in to find out the plug end slides together but doesn't snap in. They worked so i left it be. That evening both headlights would not turn on because the plugs vibrated loose. I put 2 zipties around each plug and they still vibrate loose leaving me with no headlights. I will be going to find the brand i used on my previous truck and buy them since they worked awesome and clipped together. Till them i will be putting my regular headlight bulbs back in so i am not driving down the road at night and randomly loose my headlights.Attached is pic of the zipties and how i just got them both working and 1 is already not coming on unless i hold the plug, as soon as i let go it turns off.

I like this carrier very much. It was easy to set up and strap down. The straps are very secure and reinforced where they attach to the bag. Kept everything clean and dry, even driving in rain. Road noise was almost not noticeable. This holds much more than you'd think. I put several sleeping bags and several fold-up camp chairs in it and had room to spare.

This bag is very nice for when I have to run errands or when Im going somewhere so I can just put all my gear in the bag instead of having to bring a backpack with me. I can fit a medium size jacket with hard shoulder and elbow pads and a foam back pad and a pair of gloves. Its a fairly tight fit but I never found myself struggling to fit both those items in it. It also looks pretty good on my GS500F

I bought these to replace identical ones that I bought maybe 20 years ago.  The old ones were definitely more comfortable with thicker more plush cushions.  However for the price I'm happy.  Important note: as others have mentioned the plastic base that comes with these seats is absolute junk.  I was able to utilize the sturdy wood bases that came with the old seats. The cheap bases is the reason for my three star rating.

Got this bad mama jama in yesterday and amazed at quality.The overall build is a nice solid piece with some weight to it. I plugged it up and it lit up my entire back yard. LEDS over tradional all day.At this price you need to buy 10 of em.Shipping was fast, shocked at the quality of product. Very bright, sturdy, I like that the bolts on front allow me to tighten, unscrew etc.And this price thoughhhhhhh..Best part is that the power cord comes straight out the back, not the side like other cheap bars

This Polaris fuel filter kit came in fast for free shipping.  Cheaper than anywhere else online for two filters.  Road 60 miles at a off road park the next day I put it on. never leaked a drop and didn't let any water though when I went through deep water.  So good deal.....

6 weeks and 940 miles ago installed this product with the products listed below in my 95 Jeep Cherokee XJ 4.0L and it runs so much cooler with no leaks or any other problems. Before it ran around 210 and would start to over heat during extended stops. Now average temp is 165-170 and never heats up above that... This performance water pump seems to curculate so much better then stock. Installation requires novice experience, not for beginners... I'm completely satified with this design..

Very poor quality. The switch broke the first time I mocked up the wiring in my living room.I guess I would rather have it fail on first testing rather than once I got it all installed. An issue like this is really unsafe, as if it had all been installed it could have caused a short and possibly even a fire.

I have always loved detailing cars, my own that is.  Of course, I've always looking for even better products.  I go back to the 60's when  Mirror Glaze by Meguiars's was hard to get.  I have vacillated between Meguiar's  and Mother's, and tried numerous other brands of related products.  After all of these years, I have finally found the product that I will be using from now on.  I like to apply a very thin coat about once a month.  EzDetailer gives the depth of shine that is unsurpassed.  The icing on the cake is how easy it is to use.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought this directly on their website at [...]  I originally was given a can by a thoughtful neighbor who knows how obsessed I am with detailing my cars and boats.  He found it at one of the demos that Ezdetailer does at various Costco stores

This is a really good product! Im very happy with the fitment and quality of the material they used. It really only takes about 20 to 30 minutes to install both the backside and of the bench seat. I had no problems getting the correct color that I selected. I have read it for you product reviews from other Buyers mentioning that they received in the wrong color or it was not as described. Im happy to say that I had no issues or concerns with the product other than that I wish they offered more color choices. I attached some pictures of when I first put them on. Theres a few wrinkles and creases because when they send it to you its folded. Anyway keep up the great work!

Decided to invest in some Husky Floor liners for my 15' Camry SE after getting tired the difficulty of cleaning the OEM carpet mats. Can't believe those things were quoted as $299 on the car invoice...lol..And the dealer wouldn't let me excluded them in order to save $$.These Husky's are definitely worth it. They fit perfectly & the spikes underneath keep each mat in its place. The only negative is that the drivers mat covers the trunk & gas opener but am fine w/ that or might just cut a hole there later

Not only did these fix my sagging issue (the one that seems to plague every single TB out there, making them look Old and worn out), it also gave my TB a small 1" or so lift when used with Bilstein HD shocks.Once the springs settle, will be about even with rear.

Fits right in, took about 1.5 hours to complete. BE SURE TO KEEP RUBBER BUSHINGS FROM ORIGINAL, the new one does not come with these bushings they are also referred to as isolators. Be sure to also put down a bucket to collect spilled coolant and dispose of properly. Flush out radiator prior to installing to rinse out any packaging materials that may have fallen into the radiator. Plastic tank so not solid aluminum, but at this price you expect that.I recommend replacing thermostat and radiator cap at the same time doing this. Also, has a lot more room when everything is already out. There is a great help video on Youtube by Admiral Off-Road called "Jeep Cherokee XJ radiator replacement", very easy to follow along with. Be sure to clean out your coolant overflow tank as well, mine had about an inch of rust sitting on the bottom.Difficulty level - IntermediateTools Required - Torx bits, metric sockets, A/C disconnect tool, pliers or screwdriver depending on hose clamp styleSupplies Required - Radiator, Fluid, Thermostat (recommended)

This purchase was a HUGE win for my wallet. In November 2015 I purchased a used 2012 Chevy Silverado, unfortunately it only came with one key and one remote. After recovering from the small heart-attack I had when the dealership said they wanted nearly $500 for a second key and remote I went about finding a cheaper way to get the job done. Found these on Amazon, ordered them, and then discovered I could make the keys work with my truck but not the remotes. Apparently, GM removed the ability for owners to pair new remotes with their Silverados in 2010...I wonder why! I'll give you a hint, the word starts with M, ends with Y, and is commonly denoted by this symbol: $. Again, I called the dealership and somehow the price just to program the two remotes I now had in my possession was still nearly $500! Again, I set out on a cheapskates' hunt to find a better (read cheaper) way to get the job done. I ended up finding a local automotive locksmith who paired the remotes to my truck for a reasonable fee of $75. In total I ended up spending just under $130 for the purchase of these two keys and remotes, cutting of the keys, and programming of the remotes---a huge savings over what the "stealership" wanted! Both remotes work just as well and have the same range as the genuine GM remote that came with my truck. I am very happy to have 3 remotes and 3 keys for my truck for a reasonable fee.

It does it's job well. What more can I say? For $20 this is a good budget tool for the average electrical enthusiast. I used it on a weatherpack pin set and works great. Just make sure to use the correct size for the wire gauge you are crimping. The numbers on the jaws are 1 through 5, which I'm not familiar with. I would prefer if they listed the gauge number instead (I.e. 18awg), no big deal though. I also like that the pivot design keeps the jaws parallel to each other, a nice touch.

I liked the idea of this product and I used to think Dee Zee made nothing but quality. So I added it to my wish list and my wife gave it to me for Christmas. Turns out they came up with a great idea and then sourced low quality parts. Installation was easy, there was enough clearance on my truck for it to fit nicely, but when I was installing one of the nuts the threads stripped out before the nylon was on the stud. When it got to the point that the nylon should have threaded on the thread of the nut stripped instead. There was still a gap behind the nut, it was not cross threaded, just low quality material. I was ok with this. I could grab another nylock nut tomorrow. Then I lowered the tailgate for the first time and it barely slowed down, still hit the retaining cables with enough force to give the truck a strong jolt. The gate on my '05 Silverado easily overpowered the gas strut. I figured there was still a slight chance that I happened to get one with a weak strut AND a bad nut, so I came here for reviews. The other reviews made me realize this was a low quality novelty item at best. I believe the strongest way to let a producer know that they need to improve is through returns, so unfortunately it had to go back. I hope Dee Zee offers this kit with improved quality parts someday, I really like the idea of a soft open gate and it's a good design. But it's currently not a quality product.

Initial results are good. Quite hydrophobic but not glassy smooth like wax.Does not address light scratches though, that's a different product. This C2 spray is good for a surface that has been treated with Crystal Serum, Crystal Serum Light or Crystal Lacquer... or other top coats or wax.Also think this product might be too expensive to use routinely after every wash - it is supposed to last many months anyways. Might save this for when we show off the car, or prior to the rainy season... like now in Florida.

I do like to carry a lot of emergency equipment in my car and towing straps are one of them.  I have had to be towed with them, but also like to have them on board just in case someone else needs to be pulled out of a ditch.  This is exactly the type Ive had used on my small truck to pull it back into my driveway.  When theres ice or snow, theres no knowing which way a vehicle will move.These are not recovery straps, but rather simple towing straps.  If you do a lot of off-road driving, take a pass and head to recovery straps.  There are plenty of cautionary notes right on the front of the carrying case, something you should heed, especially if you haven't used them before.  Ive broken down before (who hasnt), but its so much easier to use these than call AAA and wait.  If you have someone else to help, they are very easy to use, especially in snow emergencies.One thing I do like is the fact that theres a carrying case.  I found it easy to curl them up and put them back into the case after trying them out.  Each and every time you use them, especially if youve never used them before, check out those straps.  The hooks should be placed on the tow hooks on a secure part of the frame (hooks)  Most do have tow hooks, but refrain from using them on a fender. I have two tow hooks in the front and one in the rear of my vehicle.  They are easy to spot and equally easy to access.FEATURES:'  Has a heavy-duty polyester 1-3/4 x 20 tow strap'  Capable of pulling up to 10,000 pounds'  Two quick-release safety hooks'  Easy to hook up and remove'  Perfect for towing most smaller vehiclesThese straps are very heavy-duty, well-sewn and designed.  Each of the hooks is has a quick-release design. They came off quickly and easily without any struggle save a quick tug to get them around the hook.  I consider this type of strap to be great to have on hand during the winter.  Sliding into a ditch or into a snowbank happens all the time around here and these can be lifesavers. If you get stuck, these are a great bargain that will pay for themselves the first time out.Sample provided for review.

One star because I can't put 0 stars.  I Followed the instructions on the back of the bottle and added this to my freshly rebuild engine .  The additive had a chemical reaction with the bottled water that the instructions recommended.  The additive was creating a gas that was creeping past my radiator cap while the engine was cold. Car was sitting for 3 days .After releasing the pressure and draining my cooling system , A white  powdery residue was left behind in the entire system.  Had to take it all appart and flush the system.  According to other horror stories I have read , Royal purple claims that the chemicals can react with minerals in water and create pressure . This product is dangerous and can harm you and your  car.

So I was all over amazon looking for the right ones for my 2017 JKU. I am so glad I got these and I love them. They arrived today and installed in 5 min each side. They are heavier than what the photos show. The grips are soft and give a good feel in the hands. The instructions are pretty basic but a helpful tip is look at both handles and have the top hole angled out towards the a pillar. You will know if they are backwards. The visor makes contact but that's fine. It still works properly.

I might have missed the description stating that this bracket was plastic. It seems that it will do the job of holding the shower wand.  I should have checked the weight, and then I might have suspected it was plastic. The metal coating seems quite thick. I have not mounted it yet and will update as soon as I get it mounted.

Alright, 1st let me start out by saying these are by far the best headlights you can get that don't look yellow. They are a solid white / bright blue which look better than stock AND after market HIDs (yuck) IMO. Reason I bought these was because both of my old Philips Crystal Visions burnt out the same day! So after a friend recommended these I went for them!  They've been in my car for about a month now and they're doing fine as expected. I'll keep this updated if anything changes

Nice looking and functional!!  Just what I needed to reduce my fuel pressure to the level needed for the carburetors - AND still keep that pressure up when I stomp on the gas pedal.I use 3.5 PSI, and a quick throttle hit causes a dip down to 2.5 PSI (fully acceptable!!) with a quick recovery ( < 1 second).I'm pleased with it.

This product works excellent for me. I couldn't find a sealant that would work efficiently to seal freshly restored headlights until I happened upon this product. I've read several reviews of this saying it doesn't work and to just carnauba wax. I can honestly say that it does work and I've yet to find another product that does. I do agree that before applying that you must spend time restoring the lenses properly or you will end with horrid results. I didn't apply it directly to the lens but to a microfiber cloth and wiped it onto the lens. After dry time I applied a coat of wax atop and my results were beautiful.

I've had some experience with LED headlight kits now for a little while. Ordered these earlier this year for a Honda Grom which didn't work out as they flicker due to lack of proper power. That being said when the engine was revved these were super bright!I now have a 2015 Honda CB300F and these worked out beautifully! They are VERY VERY bright and the light is directed where it needs to be. The high beam works just as well by adding additional light further down road and not just being a "bright / brighter" scenario.Color is about 5500k, not too blue and not too warm. Good on the eyes at night. Simulates sunlight.The construction seems to be good and I'm very satisfied with my purchase. Anxious to see how they last long term and I will report back if I have any issues.Can't go wrong here.

I got this for my 2014 Jeep Wrangler JKU to replace the transfer case fluid, transmission fluid, and power steering fluid. The owners manual requires that ATF+4 fluid be used for all three. The part number on the Mopar bottle is 68218058AC, but the part number that Amazon recognizes as the right fluid is Mopar 68218058AA which is a different part number. They are both the same thing, just different part numbers. Fluid is red and looks to be the correct fluid that is needed. Can't go wrong with oem Mopar fluids!I wasn't sure at first so i had to do a little research to confirm.

1997 Nissan D-21 Pickup Truck. PERFECT! I used (1) of the included threaded brass studs & matched it to the almost 3 feet long factory antenna. I also used 1 of the included rubber O-rings. I screwed it right in tightly using  the O-ring between the antenna mast to keep it from backing out. It also adds just a bit of flex enough to NOT HAVE TO REMOVE IT if I desire to use a mechanical car wash. I turned on my radio & it picked up the stations with clarity. Possibly better than the original. The carbon fiber is REAL and not a decal or print. If the anodized black aluminum ever fades, It's super easy to unscrew by hand & refinish with some Black Satin spray paint. One way to avoid any anodized aluminum from fading is to use a UV Rated clear spray paint before installation. UPDATE: The "NISMO" logo didn't last a day but I didn't buy this for "street cred" & don't care about names just good values. If it becomes stolen or damaged, I'll gladly purchase another for the $8 and change. No problem.

My battery in my DuroMax MX4500E died over a year ago. Originally, I looked for a replacement, and they ran about $40-$50. It's an oddball size battery that is hard to find anywhere, and if you do find it, it costs way too much, considering more powerful batteries (i.e. this battery) costs much less. While searching, I came across this battery, and it was only a fraction of the price, so that got me thinking about how to place it into my generator. I needed to extend the battery tray a half inch. I cut the left side of the tray off and welded in a new piece that would fit the new battery. After a little welding, re-wiring, and a some powder coat, this battery fits perfectly. I wanted mine to look like it was like that from the factory. You could probably get away with just cutting one of the sides off, re-wire, and a bungee cord. Worth it either way.

The product came in and was poorly cast. One of the mounting holes had, what appeared to be, splatter from a weld which kept the bolt from being able to be inserted. Also, the threaded mounting hole wasn't threaded deep enough to allow the factory bolt to go all the way in. After correcting those issues, I still had a check engine light. Just received the AC Delco part and it was much better.

Not very "good looking", but they are functional, they fit well, very snug and secure on my 2014 Chevy Silverado. Even slamming the door doesn't misadjust the mirror position. Much better than the older design of the CIPA mirrors. And they're removable for better looks and theft deterrence.

These BA15s LED bulbs I used in my motor home to replace the older "regular" bulb in all my overhead lights. Those bulbs were number 1156, a normal car bulb,  usually a tail light or a back up light bulb. My motorhome  uses 1156 for back up lights. An 1157 is a 2 contact 2 filament bulb usually used for a tail light stop and turn light.NOW,  The letters in an LED bulb such as this one, Ba15s. The Ba 15 is the base size and all Ba15 are the same size as the twist in common bulb for vehicles,and the s means single contact single filament bulb(1156). If it were a Ba15d it would be a double contact two filament bulb(1157). The letters SMD (surface mounted diode) mean LEDs and the 2 numbers preceeding SMD in the bulb description are the number of LEDs the bulb has. So this bulb has 28SMD, so it has 28 LEDs. The more SMDs the longer and brighter the bulb is. This bulb is about 1/2 inch longer than the 1157 bulbs I took out. It is A BRIGHT WHITE. No yellow tint at all, and barely fits inside the snap on lens. I would not use anything over 28 SMD. If you want a little less bright use bulbs with a lower number SMD. Example 25SMD  I believe there is a  Light bulb buyers guide on Amazon. It is worth while to look at. So this is a bright white light but I like it bright inside,so yes I'd buy this 10 Pack again. Hope I ve helped a little. : )

Could be better. I bought it a few months ago. I have it install on my Scorpion EXO-R2000 it's a little uncomfortable and on my LS2 FF348 was better. I live in a heavy rain country and the Sena works excellent, the only bad thing in a heavy rain, is that if it gets wet between the base and the Seine, begins to fail, must be dried and put back to keep it running smoothly.The voice command somethings can be an issue, but works more than it fails. The 20S has a lot of good functions, the bad thing is that most of the just work with other 20S, since my friends doesn't have the 20S (they use the smh5) I can't use it a good as I could.The better thing is the battery, I use it every day with music and a ride back to home of 40min on a intercom with a friend and I charge it one time per week.Summary:If you want to have the last technology of SENA, bought it, if you don't want to spend a lot of money on this. Buy the other ones, the met expectations and work as good as this but less functions.

I attempted installing this product on my motorcycle, a 2014 Suzuki Boulevard C50 BOSS. It didn't work out. My headlight was to big for the windscreen to rest in front of it, instead, it rested behind it causing it to be too close to my handle bars. The seller was generous enough to accept the return, the shipping at my expense, but that is to be expected. This product is shipped from China, something that is not stated so it was too my surprise when my ETA was given to me after purchasing the product. However, it took twelve days to arrive to the SF Bay Area. The quality of the product is what one should expect for the price. I ordered the smoke tinted one, which does appear as a grey color, but when the sun hits it, it appears purple, like the cheap tint you see on some cars. It also had several swirl marks on it. It downgraded the aesthetic look of my bike so I'm glad it didn't work out. Overall, I bought this only as a temporary installment on my bike to blow the winter wind away from me, so if you're okay with the look on your bike and you're on a budget, the go for it. This wasn't for me. I'll attach some pictures that the seller sent me to demonstrate how it should look since it doesn't come with instillation instructions.

I really like this LED brake and turn signal light. I bought it for a gift to install on my dads Harley for better visibility, can never have to many lights on a motorcycle IMO. They installed easy on and are very bright, brighter than expected.  They were packaged well, the case lens is tented but not too dark and appear to be very tough and water resistant.The brake and turn signals built together are a nice feature, it made the bike much cleaner while providing good visibility from behind.  I am very happy with my purchase and believe you will be as well.I often rely on reviews to help me make good purchases, if you have any questions feel free to comment to my review and ill reply.

Looks great, and was more than enough for my Suzuki S40. Keeps the pipes considerably cooler too.

The shipping box was damaged but the had the bumper wrapped up really good in bubble wrap and the bumper looked great. It was a easy install and it looks awesome on my 2015 rzr 900 xc I highly recommend this product it is built well and is very sturdy. I would use this seller again.

Great product. Solid steel block. Installed in about 1 hour by myself in the garage with air tools. Can be done with out air tools. I bought the to lift the back of the truck, the front had a leveling kit already installed. The rear end is taller then the front now. Before the front was taller then the back.

Used the "chock the wheels, put it in Reverse and listen to them clicking" method to determine I only had one bad sensor. Bought this 2-pack so I could have a spare. Have to admit for $17 total I was very pleasantly surprised by the robust packaging, general feel, and overall quality of these Made in China (yes, that's on the package) sensors.Bottom line: it got the job done and I once again have a fully functional back up warning system.

I just installed these on my 2015 Ram 1500 Laramie Crew cab. My truck has the 5.7 Hemi/ 8 speed auto/ 4x4 drivetrain.  As some other reviewers have posted, installation may not be "straightforward" on all models. On my truck, the lower mounting holes did indeed already have nuts welded to the inside of the frame.  Rather than drill them out or knock them out, I opted to retain these nuts and instead attach the brackets to my truck using new 8 mm x 30mm bolts that I bought from the local hardware store. Since these bolts are slightly smaller than those supplied with the running board, I opted to purchase shoulder bolts so that I could use the supplied lock washer and flat washer. Although this meant using only the attached stud to retain the inner mounting bracket for the iBoard, I didn't feel that this would create any problem and proceeded to mount the passenger side board without any additional issuesAs I moved to the installation of the driver's side board, I found a surprise.  The front bracket could not be installed due to the presence of a steel brace/bracket that ran from the frame (just above the upper mounting hole for the iBoard) to the driver's floor pan.After consideration, I decided to proceed with the installation. In order to make the front bracket work, I had to grind a channel in the top of the iBoard bracket, so that the bracket could be positioned under the floorboard brace stiffener.  Next, a slot needed to be cut into the bracket to allow one of the floorboard brace bolts to be removed then re-installed, passing through the iBoard bracket.  Finally, 3 fender washers needed to be placed behind the iBoard bracket and aligned with the lower mounting hole, in order to make the bracket sit flat as it was now positioned on top of the steel brace floorboard brace (which is roughly 1/4" thick).After some major fabrication to the front left bracket, I managed to mount the driver's side iBoard and align it satisfactorily (thanks to the slots in the iBoard brackets).  It did add a couple of additional hours to the installation.  The manufacturer could easily modify this bracket to use the lower two frame mount holes for 2015 and up Rams and this would solve the problem.Before purchasing these running boards, I would suggest looking under your truck to see if this brace/stiffener is present.  If it is, and you are not willing to do the modifications mentioned, you may want to steer clear of these boards or have a professional install them.Other than the above, it seems like a good product but based on the difficulties I encountered with mounting them to a model that they were supposed to fit, I can justify no more than an mediocre rating.UPDATE (12/12/2015) - The boards are holding up well with this installation method.  APS customer service have not responded to my email regarding the installation issues (its been 30 days), so if you have any problems you may not receive very good service from them.UPDATE (04/23/2016) The boards themselves are holding up fine, however, the brackets are badly rusted (the rusting started shortly after installation). The coating on the brackets is of very poor quality. I would suggest having them blasted and powder coated locally if you want them to remain looking nice.

This is an excellent and sturdy decal. Some vinyls are hard to transfer and stick to the paper, but this was easy to put on while still sticking securely to the box I put it on. Not a long to say about a decal, but if you're in the market for a Mythosaur skull, this is a good one.

installed on 2007 Chevy Avalanche. 2" is definitely just right for the offset on some standard tires. After installing I noticed much less body roll during cornering and improved stability! Gives a great look as well! Rear wheels are nearly flush with body flair and stick out minimally in front!  An improvement all around!

Heavy duty snow busting power. This thing is huge and you may need it for where you live. This is the second Warn plow i have purchased, one stays at my camp, this one will be at my house. I have used the Warn set up for a few years now, and it can't get much easier to use. The only thing you need to replace is s***ty plastic piece that winch rope/cable goes through. I have no idea why it would come with plastic.... But you will find installation very simple, the blade and mount come with directions, the push tube will not. All parts you will need will come with a part of the kit (blade, push tube, mount). Also look at Warns website to see if this fits your quad. Amazon says this won't fit my 2016 Polaris Sportsman. This picture says otherwise. The one thing i would recamend is getting extra lighting for the plow, which the top of the blade is already pre-drilled, so you can mount a light bar to. Anyways my old warn kit is a few years old, and does its job well I will continue to buy as long as their winches quality stays the same.

Great product and easy as can be to install. I got the 8000k bulbs for headlights and 4300k for foglights. The headlights are super bright and the perfect amount of blue in my opinion. The high beams are not even needed because the low beams are so bright! As for the fog lights I could barely see the light on the road in front of me with standard halogen bulbs but now with the 4300k hid fogs I can very clearly see the light on the road right in front of my Subaru Forester. 4300k is almost the exact same color as halogen bulbs to. I'm going to order 4 more kits for my family for Christmas presents. I think every car should have these because they make driving at night so much safer!

First it is shown as a black case but I was sent a white one. This will no longer be discreet on my motorcycle and draw attention to the fact I have an EZPass or something in it. The cover does not snap shut as some have stated. If I use this on a motorcycle i need the cover to snap shut tightly so the EZPass does not rattle and pop-out. Will attach photo of white case.Update (6/10/2016): Tonic concepts sent out a black one to replace the white one I received and it worked fine at first but the suction cups weren't that good.Update (10/13/2016): Suction cups do not hold in cold weather and as a result I lost the cover and my EZPASS when I hit a bump this morning and it popped off and is sitting somewhere on I95 near Baltimore. I do not recommend using this on a motorcycle.

Ordered this to replace the faulty starter on my 3.0 4 cylinder Mercruser. Looks just like the picture (without the gasket though). Was worried once I removed the old 1 and realized the new 1 was half the size and had 11 teeth instead of 9 like the old 1. After double & triple checking part numbers and engine model numbers and what not, decided to install it and just see what happened.... and it worked great. Taking it to the lake tomorrow.*Update*Have taken the boat out several times and the starter has performed flawlessly. I do a lot of inner-tube towing with my kids, so I am constantly turning the boat on and off and I haven't had any problems with the new starter.

This is my second helmet. The first helmet I bought was a Scorpion, a decent helmet, but I was sized wrong, as both myself and the sales person didn't know much about proper sizing procedures. I got a 2XL in that and discovered much later that was too big. After research and sizing the right way, I ordered the DLX Qualifier in XL. At first it seemed like a tight fit, but it was tight in all the right places, and over time it has conformed to my head and face, and no longer squeezes my jaw. I like that it's set up for the Sena communicator, but I haven't tried it out yet. The color scheme is awesome, I get comments on it all the time. It seems a little bit louder than the Scorpion I have, but I wear the plugphones ear plugs to listen to music and cut down on engine and wind noise, so it's not too bad. I think my favorite part is the transition face shield. It tints to a dark smoke in the sun, and at night it's clear, no more toting around an extra clear shield! It transitions fairly quickly too, so going into a tunnel it lightens up enough to see. It doesn't get dark enough to not wear sunglasses underneath though. I also didn't like how they covered up the pin up devil may care graphic with the DOT sticker. I ended up heating it up a little and peeling it off. See the picture for that. Overall, great helmet.

The initial setup of the top portion was not easy. I would imagine that having a second person would be ideal. Once that top portion is in place, the EZ zip is named appropriately. It's a snap, well zip actually. Seriously, this is a good product. I have also read other reviews about the 12v power awning. So far no problem for the awning motor or the size of the top portion rolling up.

I've had this light since 2015, and it's still holding strong, no moisture has gotten in, and trust me we've had plenty of it, just look up floods in magic valley Idaho. The only thing I did wrong was didn't hook up a 40 amp relay and burned up a switch. That was my fault. I recommend this light bar

"Fixing a hydraulic clutch slave cylinder in a 2007 Wrangler" I did an install video online under that title.I LOST MY CLUTCH.. AGAIN!  Different Jeep though. There is that monument when you start the jeep and it just takes off, it was an indication of a problem. The clutch had very little action and that only near the floor. As I left and headed out in 5 oclock traffic I soon discovered that shifting and stopping were going to be an issue. I drove home in 3rd gear slowing to avoid a stop and stall. Under the transmission bell at the seam there was some fluid dripping. This was my second clue.  Here is the list of tools and part numbers to get the repair done.Pros:Quick shipping.Perfect fit.Easy to bleed.All parts included.Cons:It needs a zip tie thing that snaps off after inserted like on a YJ.Getting it to compress and line up is hard if pre-bled.Tools needed:13 MM deep socket6 inch extensionRatchetSmall flathead.DOT3 fluid.Drip pan. Place pan under cylinder to catch fluid.Step one:Remove two nuts holding clutch cylinder to transmission. Unhook any cables in the way.Step two.Use small flat head to remove retaining clip on top where line connects.Twist and pull, watch out to make sure rubber fitting is not damaged, you may need that.Step three.Attach new cylinder and secure with hairpin clip. The line needs to be pushed completely in or it will pop out.Step four.Bleed cylinder by pushing plunger in slowly till you cant hear air bubbles passing through to reservoir. This took around 15 times for me. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE FLUID IN THE RESERVOIR.Step five.Make sure plunger is properly aligned and push towards mounting bolts. Check to see if line bracket is lined up with holes on side of cylinder.Step six.Tighten bolts and secure all disconnected components.Step seven.Bleed cylinder as needed. If needed have someone push the clutch in as you open the valve to let any air bubbles out.  Just like brakes.Check to see if clutch is properly working and no grinding occurs when shifting.  If all goes well there should be no fluid on the lower portion of the transmission bell and you should be good to go.

Seems to work well.  Not as easy to install as what it appears, but not as hard as you could imagine.  Took about two hours because I was particular about where to run the air lines.  Bags hold air well so far, we will see as time tells.  Really does add weight capacity and stability to the rear of my JKU.

I've been a automotive finish enthusiasts for 30+yrs. I've used a bunch of different waxes in that time and frankly 99% of the time you get exactly what you pay for. And diffrent waxes tend to be engineered for different strengths. IE cheaper spray waxes tend to be quick and easy with short lasting results.  More expensive paste tends to require more skill and effort to apply but the results last longer with a much deeper gloss.Enter Yellow Wax Paste.Pros: Gloss comparable to $60+ waxes.  For paste the application is fairly easy  Durable finish  Smell is not overpoweringCons: Can be hard to remove if left too long  No applicator included  Builds up in edges and corners if not careful  Gloves should be worn till your used to working with it. Avoid coating your handsThe wax is an outstanding value. It behaves like a much more expensive wax. And even for a paste its not an overwhelming task.  There's a learning curve. If you apply and buff too soon it will haze again requiring a second buff. If you wait to long the wax will set hard and can be very difficult to remove. Let's be honest everything including this wax leaves scratches on your vehicles finish. It's how those scratches are arranged and how fine they are that brings in the final result. With proper application this wax gives amazing results.  I clay and wax every 3months. I do not use a mechanical buffer. I do not use a mechanical applicator. I do sponge foam apply thin coats (2) and remove with a micro fiber. I hand buff with a new flannel polish cloth. The car pictured is 4yrs old and garage kept. It does sit outside during the work day. As your viewing it the application is 1mo old, maintained with quick detailer/micro fiber and buffed with flannel.

Great quality sticker! Vinyl is very durable and has already lasted one trip through the carwash with no troubles. Only time will tell if this holds up in the outdoor environment. I purchased a couple other Molon Labe stickers to see which one would work the best, and I am sure I made the right choice. Shipping was very quick and arrived within 4 days. Glad I bought 2!

This is a great duster!  A previously used duster left behind lint that I hadn't at first noticed all over my dash, but this picked it right up!!  And DIDN'T leave anything behind.  I'm sure this time haha.  Being the one always in the driver's seat, I just hadn't noticed it before, but this last weekend I was in the passenger's seat and omg it was REALLY obvious!  So I used this and it not only got rid of new dust, but also the little pieces of red duster lint left behind from that other one that I THOUGHT I liked *argh!* This comes in a plastic case with a rope handle that you just pull out to use, and just stick it back in when you're done.  It is washable and has a comfortable handle.  It also has a lifetime money back satisfaction guarantee!I purchased this duster at a discount in exchange for my honest review and opinion.

I the contents of this 6 pack box leaked out.  I am not sure how this happened since the bottles have an aluminum seal.  I assume the product is very old and deteriorated the seal.  This review is not about the actual Techron product itself which is very good.  Packaging or age is the issue.

I found the best price for these airbags here on Amazon and Amazon allows you to make sure that a certain product will fit your vehicle before it is purchased.  But after I was on Firestones website I knew that 2535 would fit my particular truck but amazon said it would not.  I could have ordered the one from firestone listed here&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Firestone-W217602535-Ride-Rite-Kit-for-Ford-F-250-350-Diesel/dp/B004BS0M50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Firestone W217602535 Ride-Rite Kit for Ford F-250/350 Diesel</a>&nbsp;for a bigger price tag, but I took my chances knowing what I saw on firestones website and order this one even though Amazon said it wouldn't  fit and that it was a Prime product helped too.  When it arrived, it was brand new and made for 2011 - 2013 Ford F250 SuperDuty Trucks with 4WD Diesel.  I did order these bag with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/AIR-LIFT-72000-Wireless-Air-Leveling-Compressor/dp/B001OMVCN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AIR LIFT 72000 Wireless Air Leveling Compressor</a>&nbsp;to complete the install, but I was a bit worried about this product as well, because the picture stilled showed the older version of this kit, when they do have a Generation 3 Air Lift kit that doesn't have the extra barrel fuse wire and it makes for a simpler install.  So when it arrived it was the Gen 3 and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  Do yourself a favor and get these bags here and the Air Lift wireless controller.

Worked very well on my '91 Accord.  I cut the old boot off the rectangular wire frame under the console plastic, and whip-stitched this new one onto the wire frame with heavy black thread, lining up the slits in the new boot with the wire.I took the standard shift knob off (unscrewed after pulling the old boot down; prying the chrome ferrule down off the shifter clips; yes it's really hard to turn!).  Next, clipped the two tabs of the know that engaged the chrome bezel on the original boot, and carefully filled the protruding plastic cylinder very thin so that it would fit into the black ferrule at the top of this new boot.  After I slid the new boot over the shift lever, I turned the boot inside-out and attached a couple of nylon tie-wraps around the shift lever to hold the ferrule up tight against the knob.One thing to note - the boot is asymmetric; it leans towards the driver side - make sure you clamp it in with the correct orientation - if not, just unclamp and rotate a half turn.

These lights are great. My hubby put them on our golf cart. They look awesome. These LED lights are pretty bright. They make riding the golf cart at night even better than the factory lights. I would recommend these lights along with the seller.  Seller was very knowledgable and kept in contact with fast response time.** I received this product for free in exchange for my thoughts, experiences, and honest written review

71150WUGTBL._SY88.jpg
OVERALL THOUGHTS:Not as bright as others I had/ have, but a this price (currently under $10 for 10 bulbs)you can't beat this value. The best ones I have are from LEDMOD_DOT_COM and were $5 for a pair.  The LEDS I bought here from JTECHnow are only maybe 10% dimmer than the super bright ones I own.  Most buyers will not notice this and if you use them in pairs, should not have any issues. Some quailty issues were noticed, but they did not keep the LED bulbs from working. I will be buying more of these from Amazon and this seller over the other brighter ones I have.WHAT I GOT: (See my image for reference)The bulbs come in an easy to open display packaging. Mine were neatly organized and had a small foam layer behind them that kept them from rattling.  The entire package was then placed in an padded envelope.  Not the best packaging for shipping but it arrived safely.QUALITY INSPECTION: (See my image for reference)The LED's looked very nice.  All were clean and free of residue from solder or other films from the manufacturing process.  I did notice on two of the LED assembly's that they were made at an odd angle.  This might affect use if the tolerance is tight for your application, but not for me. (See my image for reference.)I could not notice any cold solder joints and all solder looked shiny and clean with good contact.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I give the solder job on these a solid 8. I tried a light twist test to see if the circuits would easily break off the plastic base, but they seemed well enough secure.  Your not going to have any twisting forces when inserting or removing these bulbs.TESTING: (See my image for reference)My testing was semi scientific as I used a DC power supply with 3VDC, 4.4VDC,6VDC, 7.5VDC,9VDC and 12VDC.  Each were tested at 7.5VDC, 9VDC and 12VDC.  (I could not get them to light on any voltage lower then the 7.5VDC setting of my supply.)  I did this to verify that each worked, and to verify if they are polarity sensitive (they ARE) and to note which side is the positive and negative for later use. At 7.5VDC the LEDS lit up.  You could see each individual segment clearly.(each LED assembly has 3 light emmitting segments)  At 9VDC you can not look at them without hurting your eyes. The LEDS were bright and full. 12VDC was full brightness and blinding after just glancing at them quickly.  Within seconds I felt like I was looking into a camera flash. Unfortunately this was hard to photograph, because the varying output would affect my camera's focus and apeture. The higher the voltage, the darker the background seemed.  I did manage to get a few decent pictures for reference.  All the bulbs were left running for about 5 minutes before removing from my test jig. All bulbs appeared to have the same color (PURE WHITE) and all were the same intensity, to my naked (and somewhat blinded) eye.PRACTICAL USE: (See my image for reference)I bought these to use in my restored 1995 Celica.  I had replaced the head lights with JDM ones from Japan. The stock 194 bulbs would illuminate the "City Lights" (small white marker lights within the headlights themselves) with a dim, yellow hue. The LED's fit right in the OEM socket, as snug as the original bulbs did and were a nice BRIGHT WHITE. I regret I did not take a picture with one 194 bulb and one LED bulb for a 'side by side' comparison, but I did get a decent shot of the white light within' the headlight.PROS:*Very bright white color*Uniform color & brightness from one LED to the next*EXCEPTOINAL value at less than $1 each. (including shipping!)*High quality construction & materials (rival or equals the more expesive LED's I have)*OEM fit into bulb socket (at least on Toyota Celica's!)*Easy open package that cam be reused to store unused LED bulbsCONS:*Some assembly issues/ quality control*Packaging material a bit weak in my opinion. (Shipped in a padded envelope)*Can't find out what warranty is (90 day? 6 months? 1 year?)CLOSING:  I hope to update this review wth a longevity report and if I have any issues.  As of right now (10-9-13) I and extremely satisfied with this purchace and the seller "JTECHnow", but I reserve the right to change that if they turn out to be duds!

Great inexpensive lock designed to keep your lid with your bike. I like the ability to set your own combination so you never have to worry about a memory lapse. The dials can be a bit of a pain to rotate but that's not a huge problem. The Helmtlok 4101 feels like a temporary while you are out solution while you are commuting, visiting or shopping. This lock is not a permanent solution for long term storage and shouldn't be viewed as such. I don't believe this lock is intended to be left on the bike with the helmet in situations where there is not normal foot traffic and/or security. The materials feel solid enough to provide convenience and a peace of mind but will not hold up to a well equipped determined thief. Don't leave your bike and helmet in a place where a thief will be shielded from view while tooling your lid off your bike.

Looks great on my 2014 Nissan Frontier.  I replaced the stock emblem with this.  I'm giving it 4 stars because there are minor flaws in the chrome plateing and casting, not to mention the tape on the back its hard to remove the backing tape without ruining the adhesive, so take your time...mind you the flaws are only visible from up close.  It's been on for 6 mo now and been through summer heat, rain and freezing snow and still holding strong....Helps set me apart from the rest of the Frontiers on the road.  I would definitly buy again

Ordered 26296SC011 however received 26296AJ02A  Same difference but without the copper grease pouch and some shim difference. But I will make it work, I had to use them pronto. Unlike previous deliveries a few rubber bands would have held the pads together preventing bent ends punctured Molykote pack and smudged "photo copied" instructions. Good thing I knew how to install and had some Molykote hanging around in any event.

They look great on my 2016.5 Mazda CX-5 GT! I expected a more dramatic look, but after installing them I appreciate the subtle look of the front guards. The rear guards are a little bigger. It took a little while to install the first one, but it was much quicker on the remaining three guards. Be sure to read the instructions!

Excellent mount.  I mounted a 42" light bar on it. Clamps to the gutters above the doors on my 1985 K5 Blazer perfectly.  You can mount virtually any light or led bar that you want on this mount.  The mounting surface can be rotated 180 degrees for different light positions.  Very sturdy.  The middle bar is heavy steel and the end pieces appear to be cast aluminum.  Made in USA.  I would definetly buy this product again.

Rack & Pinion Tie Rod Boots were too small to use. I bought from a local auto parts store so I could complete the replacement and get the CR-V back on the road.The rest of the parts seemed to be of good quality.

This is a must have for older 8.8 IRS. I made the mistake of buying the cobra ones with the synthetic fiber material on the clutches. Never worked from day one, I could manhandle the wheel around and work the spider gears... turns out the bigger spring is required because their carrier/spidergear pack is larger.. I ended up breaking it trying too Get it installed. Lesson learned, use the old wetclutch type and now I leave 11s again.

These are a nice upgrade to my 2006 F350 front turn signals. Please note that you will also need to upgrade your flasher relay to an EP27L (for LED lights). I had to do this to stop the rapid blink issue. They're nicely bright at night. I highly recommend them.

Spills happen, and with kid's spills will happen.  This vaccum is great for cleaning up snack cereal or lost french fries in the car.  It's also great for sucking up all those rocks and pebbles that collect in the carpet.  Great for keeping the vehicle in great shape.I use this on the seats, vents, floor, rugs, between the seats, under them, all over the car.  The extension cord is long enough to reach all over my car and I love that.  The included attachments are great for the vehicle and as I mentioned earlier detailed cleaning too.  All of the contents store in a soft carry bag great for the trunk or a utility organizer.Love the performance, it picked up everything in it's path and even the smallest rocks and pebbles, very precise.  Easy to clean out the container and then wash the filter and dry as needed.[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]

Fool me twice. I ordered this bucket before thinking a cheap little bucket would be perfect for a certain application.  First time it came totally cracked and destroyed.  Well it's been quite some time and I had the same thought, I figured maybe the shipping was just rough and A. has seemed to have gotten better with packing.Well see the picture.  I just don't think this bucket is durable enough to stand up to shipping.  It's like paper thing and sure a light cheap bucket might be handy for certain applications, but you'd be better off picking it up at the $1 store.

Bought this from K/N. This fits my 2003 Chevy Astro van 4.3L V6 without any problems. Easy installed for me best part that the logo doesn't go away when gas hits it. These filters are less restrictive than other fuel filters. My Astro now accelerates even better with this on. Pump makes less noises. Getting more MPG.  If you change your fuel pump best bet is to get one of these with it. Common problems with GM trucks and vans are overheating electronic fuel pumps. Filters gets too clog, causing Fuel pump to work harder than usual. Helpful advise is to keep the gas gauge above a quarter to keep the fuel pump  free from sucking up debris from the bottom of the fuel tanks.

Bought these for my grandsons LEM 50cc and they fit perfectly. Really think they are universal. He is 5 and enjoying his dirt bike already. With him using these, he should be able to ride it without them next year. People that are saying they make it hard to turn have them set to low and not letting the bike lean at all. I have about 2 1/2 inch gap underneath one when the other one is on the ground. He steers his bike like normal.

This takes literarily a few minutes to replace, there's no reason not to do this yourself and save big money over dealer prices. If you've never looked at your cabin air filter, you'll be amazed at how filthy it can get in just a few months. Replace this regularly at very little cost. There are lots of instructional videos on the internet that will show you how to do this. This will not shrink! It can't. The sides are made of semi rigid material similar in thickness to a plastic ruler.

I love this tool, it is so simple but works so well.  Just poke the tip between the hose and fitting, rotate it around the inner circumference of the hose, then pull the hose off.Just don't be too aggressive and sloppy when pulling hoses off with this tool.  It is possible to accidentally pierce the hose with time point of this tool.  I had this issue once while working on my boat, it was a seawater hose that I couldn't see and I did manhandle it.

Nice product, I have had them on my past 2 Jeep Wrangler TJ's. The fitment and finish is great, and they install pretty easy. I feel they are a great buy for the money. I will say I had a problem with one of my tail lights not working each time after installing them, if that happens make sure there is no dirt in the connectors and that they are plugged in all the way, and if that does not work try running a ground wire from the metal on the inside of the tail light to somewhere on the Jeep. That fixed my issue!

I have had the on two of my vehicles my accord and my explorer. They are well built and are in a metal housing not plastic which is a big plus for me. They are super bright and are a great value. To get the most out of them install them with a proper wiring harness with a relay. Now for the negative... they failed on both my vehicles. only one out of the pair failed.

Installation sucked because I did it in the cold. Otherwise they are fantastic. Hardware thats supplied it great. The machine stays much cleaner. I bought them because I put an enclosure on the machine. The enclosure stays clean unless you do 40mph into a pond.

Just installed these today, so I don't know yet how they will perform. As you can see from the photos, the Osram on the left is whiter and brighter than the standard halogen on the right. A comment on the product description on the package: On the front they proudly proclaim (in symbols) "up to 110% brighter, up to 35m more distance, up to 20% whiter light" than a standard halogen bulb but then on the back little graphs represent the same claims and an added graph shows about half the life expectancy without any explanatory text. So I guess Osram should be commended for disclosing that little tidbit about lifespan at all, but the lack of text saying "up to 50% shorter lifespan" makes it seem like they hope you don't notice.

My car has a ceramic coating on it and Reload helps maintain the slick surface that repels water so well.  I use it after every wash, and the great thing about it...the surface is so slick that using a Ego Leaf blower makes drying the car quick and easy.  In a rain storm as I drive you see water fly off the hood.  It's really impressivd

I hated the long, metal antenna on my Ram 1500. I have the new Night edition in black so everything is blacked out, except for that ugly antenna. This antenna looks sooo much better and fits with the more aggressive look of the truck. I wasn't worried about signal loss because I use satellite radio or Bluetooth my phone rather than FM/AM. I did test out some FM channels just to see if they work and I was able to still pick them up and they sounded fine.

Good price and perfect fit,added this to the project after adding a SYE kit to my 231 J transfer case.  Cheap and easy install, nice peace of mind as well since the chain is a critical part to the transfer case and transferring power to the front driveshaft and differential.

Very, very bright and very cool looking!  I get lots of compliments on these.  Quality seems OK (for a $40 pair of color matching lights) but the light output is perfect.  I still haven't fine-tuned the aiming of mine, but even generally aimed, they put out some serious light.I will update these after the season is over and they have been used and abused some more...

This works for my 2001 Toyota Sequoia SR5. You have to go to a Toyota car dealer to have it programed with your key number that came with the vehicle. It cost $32.00. I tried it on to unlock and lock doors sometimes it doesn't work and I'm only giving 3 stars since it only works on to start it.

I love this thing.  I didn't actually get it from Amazon because I found it on a clearance sale at Tractor Supply, brand new, for $79.99.  I'd been looking for a while and knew I was ready to buy but I was holding off just to save some more money.  At that price, this was a steal.  I've used it to start my V8 Tundra and it cranked right up.  The other day, I even used it as a mobile power station to run a soldering iron!  It's a big unit but it can do a lot.  I doubt I'd ever need two 12v plugs at the same time or two AC plugs at the same time so it'd have been nice to save some space there.  But for what I paid, I have absolutely no complaints.EDIT:So far I've used this portable unit to:1. Test trailer lights when I didn't have a vehicle to plug in to2. Run a 12v diesel transfer pump (pictured)3. Power a soldering iron when making an electrical field repair (pictured)4. Jump start my V8 Tundra5. Power a 12v Ag chemical spray pump

I've owned this jack now for 10 years, using it regularly for maintenance and repair of my own cars/trucks. It gets low enough to slip under every Honda/Nissan/Subaru I've owned, and jacks high enough to suit the majority of needs for a 1/2Ton pickup. This jack has never left me down (pun intended). After ten years though it is starting to show a little age. The jack will (over a period of 15-20minutes) drift down under load, but then again I've never checked the fluid level. The release has become hard to release if you're not careful, but I've learned to not tighten it as much before jacking and it's fine. The wheels are rusted and the paint is flaking, but I've never been overly careful with fluids (especially brake fluid) coming into contact. Very happy overall with this jack.My only big annoyance comes with the removable handle - when pulling the jack across the garage sometimes the handle becomes disengaged from the valve mechanism at the jack body, requiring some fiddling to get it back in. I've also since added a threaded bolt to keep the two halves of the handle securely together.To be honest I came to amazon to shop around for a new jack, but after reading reviews here and elsewhere, I decided to just invest a little time and effort and clean mine up. Tightened the casters after adding some fresh grease to bearings, oiled everything up, and it works like new now. Still need to top off the fluid but I suspect this will help with the drifting.

I do get lots of compliments on this bumper.  Its heavy so have a friend help you install it and test fit it first.  The holes on the bottom of mine did not line up so I had to use a die grinder and enlarge one of the holes to get it in line with were it needed to be.  Once I did that it all bolted up right away.  Also the bolts and hardware that came with it I was not sure that they were grade 8 so I replaced they with ones that I knew to be grade 8.  The few extra dollars spent were well worth it to me.

These N-Fab black bars look really good.  The shipping was excellent.  Arrived about a day or two earlier than I expected based on their disclaimer of that it may take a day or two extra to process.  Bought on amazon prime.  Installation was super simple, and were on in about an hour with taking my time and lock-tite'ing  each of the six bolts on each side.  Pardon my O.C.D.. Instructions are clear enough that you don't need any tips from me.Really an excellent product at a great price.  Now I can reach the top of my 2014 Dbl Cab's roof without stepping my dirty feet onto the carpeted floor mats.Things to consider. . . The bars shipped to me are "gloss black" not a shiny satin black as someone else mentioned.  Maybe their's were satin (lucky them, I would've preferred a more muted black), but they do get a lot of compliments and look really nice.  Another consideration may be that after I installed them, I realized that the "3rd step option for the front of the bed access" would've been pretty nice to have.  At the time I ordered these I didn't think I wanted the look of the three steps, but after getting the two steps I now see how nice it'd have been to have that third step.You won't be disappointed in these N-Fab's.  Enjoy

Popped my center caps off and applied. Bearing other reviews in mind, I used some Weld Adhesive that I had from a previous order to help keep these in place. They were a bit larger diameter them the caps for my C-Max and the curve was a bit shallow, bit that was overcome with a little elbow grease and some creativity to get them to conform better. Honestly, after working them a bit, you'd be hard-pressed to tell they aren't full replacement caps.

Well, I bought the filter cover wrench on the right at first from Amazon. Of course as you can see it failed dramatically. Although it is Made in the USA, the thoughts and ideas was not in existence when it was made by our folks at home. This thing slipped and could not grab the filter cover so badly. I have been taking our car to the shop for a simple oil change. It fits but just couldn't turn without slipping.  The Caldera on the other hand, as you can see has teeth on it which grabs the filter housing grooves. The Caldera grasp and hold the filter cover perfectly that it will take the cover off without slipping. Once off do not, I repeat, do not try to remove the wrench from the filter cover. Just replace the filter and install it back to the car. The wrench will come off on its own when you are tightening the cover back to the car. Caldera  is the one that will work for your Toyota oil filter cover housing. Do not buy the one on the right or any other ones that looks similar. I actually would like to get a refund from Amazon on the other  one that failed. Im giving the Caldera a 4 star because this could've been made with a 1/2 inch drive instead of the smaller 1/4 inch. Other than that, for the price, it is the best one to get.

Pros: Looks OEM, Sturdy, 45 minute install, no wheel removal necessaryCons: Screws WAY too long and sharp, one screw cannot be installed due to frame rub, decrease near wheel ground clearanceJust installed these today, so ill comment on look and install difficulty level.Installationt: You will need a drill, you will not need to remove your tires/wheels. Pretty straightforward on my 2015 JKU Rubicon, you remove a plastic rivet in the fender and use it as your anchor for the mudflap. From there the instructions tell you to mark the holes, then drill, then re-install the mudflap. I just drilled the holes with the single screw attached, no reason to mark. I was unable to install 1/5 of the mounting screws (see pic). The issue is that the screw is too long and was rubbing un the metal undercarriage of the jeep. This certainly would have been noticeable noise inside the cab, so i mounted with 4/5 screws, hence the 4 star review. Time of installation: 45 minutes. Easy install. Need Drill, Drill bit, stubby phillips head screwdriver and keys to turn your Jeep wheels for clearance. All fasteners are included (albeit too long)Fit/Finish/Look:  They look GREAT, very OEM quality. I have attached several photos for your enjoymentThanks!

In my case, this Philips CrysalVision Ultra does not give me the "bright white Xenon look" as described on the box. Instead, it giving me the same stock color looks. I am very disappointed with these bulbs. Go check out my pictures on an Audi Q5 then you will see what I mean.Update:I posted a comparison picture of the 3 major halogen bulbs that you might consider to purchase; they are the Philips H11 CrystalVision Ultra, the Osram Sylvania H11 SilverStar Ultra, and the Osram Sylvania Long Life Halogen H11 (OEM).If you want a "HID Look", none of the halogen bulbs above can provide you the "HID Look", don't be fooled by the advertisement!!However, the Philips H11 CrystalVision Ultra has the "whitest" (but it is not the brightest, Sylvania SilverStar Ultra is the brightest in my own opinion) look when compared with the SilverStar Ultra and the OEM bulbs. But it still does not give the "Bright white Xenon look" as described on the box when comparing it with the real Xenon HID Bulbs.

These for well on a 04 Honda CBR 600RR gives it a nice clean finishing touch after you remove your OEM mirrors. That CBR lettering is actually engraved which is sweet, meaning it will last. The screws it comes with are shorter then the originals as you can see from my pic BUT they do still work! I seen some reviews that say they don't but I promise you they worked on MY bike. I chose to stay with the OEM screws simply cause they are circular and the ones they give you are flat but it's simply for appearance preference.I say go head and get them you won't regret it.ONLY negative thing is you WON'T get that sweet lil moto Keychain they mislead you into believing you're getting. Which I totally wanted :(. But product it self is good to go.

I bought this to wrap interior pieces on my 2002 WRX.  It does seem to damage easy so you have to be careful with anything sharp or hard hitting it.  I have never used this before and there was a learning curve in the application, so be prepared to re-do pieces as you learn how to apply it.  A heat gun is required to soften the wrap enough to mold it around your pieces.  I am pleased with how it turned out and I have a lot of left over wrap even after re-doing several of the pieces. I would buy again

So it looks like I'm gonna be the first to review these!!Installed in like 20 mins.Awesome freakin lights!!!!!!!The speed and color is amazing.You can pretty much do what ever you desire and they preform.I did my fogs to start and will be getting the heads as well. The light from them as normal lights out preform my zxe lights by a long shot. Very pleased and shipping was fast. Can't say how they last yet but I am a happy customer. Xkglow has good reviews and I belive they will stand behind what they sell.Thank you!!Update!!Lights work great.I'm adding some pics.These get a lot of attention!!!They are replacements for stock lights that work great and also have the rgb to boot!Only thing I see as maybe an issue would be location of the on/off button. I have mine hooked up to 4 channel remote, and control power that way.Actual light function uses power as it should thru your harness.Last 2 pics of actual driving lights at night. 1 just headlights (Sylvania ZXE)2nd heads and fogs. Fogs are the XKGLOW!Not having any issues as mentioned in other review but I got the 9145. My connections work well and colors seem close but getting an exact color is difficult, I picked some favorites viewing it from outside the vehicle. The white function is a mix the rgb lights but I think it's more like blue to yellow for on coming traffic. But when using the actual light function on these they are white led.1/5/17All works as it should!Not the cheapest but worth it for me, didn't want to hack my lights to be different.Led fogs are wicked and I usually just run the rgb at max to not upset others. I have them in reflector housings and may be scattering the light. Although I don't think they are any worse than some of the new cars/trucks/buses out there.Update 5/15/17So I have one of the fans for the led driving lights complaining about having to do it's job.Makes a lot of noise at start up but then settles down. I will see if I get a reply as to what XK glow wants me to do or contact them soon.Still pleased but am glad I left the headlights alone.8/19/17My year warranty is done or will be soon.Lights still work as they should.Running the leds more often has quited down the fan. All is good I am pleased with my purchase. Never had to return replace anything so not sure how that would have gone but they did as they said they would.4/28/18Both of the led are non functioning. I think maybe lack of use maybe my fault.RGBs still work awesome and the set up will remain installed. I am still pleased with them.

This kit is great. My factory wheel was torn and crumbling after 17 years so I bought a replacement wheel, sans damage, from eBay and installed this wrap over the factory leather. It was much easier to do off the car than on, so if you can afford the time and effort to remove your steering wheel, its recommended. This kit comes with only 1 needle but two threads so you can do a baseball stitch if you are ambitious; I was not. LolI am happy with the results and wouldbuy it again  - I recommend this wrap.

During a timing belt change I decided to swap the water pump as most people do to avoid having to do it all over again down the road. I purchased this pump as it came recommended from a friend and also comes with a gasket which the Gates pump did not. This pump has a slightly different impeller design than the OEM model but appears to work just as well. The gasket is a real gem in this kit as it is quite beefy and I did not worry about it leaking one bit after the install. Do yourself a favor and put some RTV on the gasket to hold it to the pump during install. This makes it way easier to get set correctly. The pump also comes with the corner vibration rubber piece AND a thermostat seal. I purchased a new thermostat that came with one so I did not need it but I found this to be a very nice addition and applaud Aisin for giving you everything you need to swap this pump.Overall I am very happy with this pump. I have been running it for about a week without signs of issue. This pump is competitively priced with the Gates pump and having purchased and installed both, I would recommend this one over the Gates as it comes with a proper gasket and feels like it won't let me down in 10k miles.

It took a while to arrive but is a great rack.  The center-most section has a cnc-cut image of a wild boar. Personally I would have opted against that but no big deal. Installation was quick for the front 2 bolts but extremely tight for the rear two.

Just a simple quick test on my 1989 F350 plastic headlight lenses convinced me that this product makes me happy. I recommend that you try this product first before going the specialized headlight restoration route. It is the fast and easy way to clean and shine oxidized surfaces. I applied it just like a liquid wax with a soft terry foam mitt and then a minute later I wiped the haze clean with no "elbow grease" whatsoever. The attached photos don't really do the "before" image justice. The headlight's haziness was more severe than the photo suggests.  Then for fun, I tried it on my old tail lights (after I had already purchased new replacements thinking the old ones were too far gone). You can see that they shine up pretty well. I could have saved myself $42--if only I had TRIED THIS FIRST! This product belongs in every car cleaner's arsenal.

Great product, works as advertised. Easy to install easy to clean easy to maintain and keeps my garage floor absolutely spotless in the winter. If you're a Type A, do yourself a favor...mop out the melted water and salt periodically so you don't have a swimming pool in your garage all winter plus don't risk stepping in water when you get in/ out of your car. The best I've found, and I have two (one dedicated to the garage and another for inside the house) is the O-Cedar EasyWring Microfiber Spin Mop and Bucket Floor Cleaning System, which I purchased at Home Depot. It also happens to be available on Amazon for less than 35 bucks...a fantastic mop and bucket with a foot operated spinner to wring out the mop and keep your hands clean and dry...a brilliant gadget!Attached is a photo I just took after mopping out quite a bit of water, salt and dirt from the mat...looks like new. I have just read that several people complain about the wrinkles and the fact that the mat moves in their garage. Mine has been down for a while now, with several snowfalls, and the wrinkles are no big deal, it's still collects water perfectly, and it has not moved 1 inch. However I am careful when I pull into the garage so I line up fairly straight with the mat so I'm not turning my front wheels much, and I pull in slowly and apply the brakes very slowly so the car will not push the mat forward. Absolutely no problems...could not be more pleased.

Bought these to replace the stock tail signals on my fatboy when i decided to install hard saddle bags. The different functionalities available were a major plus as far as having different choices on how to install them.  I bought 4 of these but ended up only using 2 and setting them up as red running lights and blinking high red for turn indication. I gave the other 2 to a friend who wired it to be red running lights and have the amber and red flash for turn indication.

I will update review if the decal doesn't live up to expectations, but it seems as high quality as other decals I've put on my cars or laptops.Love this decal. I had originally been looking for a blue one to represent a dog that has passed on but couldn't find it, so I "settled" for this one.But once I put it on my car- absolutely love it! I put it on as soon as I got home and saw it was waiting- a day sooner than the earliest arrival date! Looks great!

I bought six of these Bull Rings for my RAM 2500 long bed and they fit perfectly fine,  they look great and are very useful. The only reason i don't give five star is because i tight them all the way with my dewalt impact drill and they are well secure(still lil bit loose) i have to figure out something to hold them super tight. Other than that great product for the price i do recommend it.

We bought a used 2011 5th wheel in 2015. The slide seal was gummy/tacky/dry-rotted then. We replaced it with this seal in April 2015. Thats why Im giving it 2 stars. It was an exact replacement, easy to install, and didn't require a call to a dealer.While doing routine roof maintenance, I noticed this seal is gummy/tacky/dryrotted. Looks like it will have to be replaced AGAIN. Ugh!We had a bumper tow with slide for over 7 years (and bought it used). We never had to replace a seal.

I found these on a how-to page on CanyonChasers.net that explains how to add LED turn-signals to a modern CAN-Bus motorcycle.  They worked perfectly and solved the rapid-flashing problem I was encountering. Small, affordable and functional! Only gave it four stars because I do wish they were a bit smaller.

I bought this code reader to use on my vehicles and to help diagnose a problem with my F-150.This Autophix OM123 code reader arrived exactly as advertised and pictured in the product listing. The code reader is extremely easy to use, simply plug and play.I tested many of the functions on this code reader and used the live data display. All of the readings appear to be dead on. There are a ton of things you can monitor on the live data display, from temperatures to engine load.Overall, this is a great value for a OBD2 code reader and data logger. It is very fast at switching between modes and is incredibly easy to use. I have had no issues with this product, if that changes I will update this review.

I bought this charger a few years ago. Just needing something in the garage to top off batteries. Don't really remember where of how much I paid for it. But I used it a few times always 10amp no more than 3-5 hours charging time. But I was cleaning the garage and I saw it. So my car was straining to start the past few weeks. So I pulled it out and used it. It still works like brand new. I never really noticed to ammeter until I started reading the other comments. So I opened it(void warranty I can't even remember when I bought it) with the 4 screws and reversed the 2 wires(same color) and put it back together. Tried it out and the needle started to move. I never really noticed that the ammeter was broken. But if you want to know the state of your battery then this is useful information. You can also get you a standalone digital voltage meter also. But with the winter coming soon. You need to properly charged battery. I also never understood the automatic vs manual chargers. Automatic are a plug it and forget it. Because it will shut off after its done. However with manual you have to watch it and turn off yourself. I just set a reminder on my phone depending on state of battery between 3-5 hours. No more than 5 hours!!!! But I didn't know it whenever I bought it. That this is a good solid charger. Knowing me I probably got a real good price for it.PS. After you charge your battery. Clean the post really good and coat it with petroleum jelly to prevent corrosion.

This little light works perfectly as a whip light for a Schwinn bicycle trailer. The flag whip is 1/4" in diameter. This light sits snugly on the top and once turned on provides a sufficiently bright white flash that gets re triggered every time the whip jostles around. If you want added safety for a bicycle safety flag this will do.

I am fortunate enough to maintain two houses - one in the mid-West for the summer and a second one in the Palm Springs area for the winter. Rather than drive 1500 miles each way I have a couple of cars in each location so each set will sit idle for six months of the year which means I usually have two dead batteries when I arrive for the season. I tried a cheaper brand of trickle charger in the desert last year and it worked but I was afraid that if it burned out I would still return to dead batteries. I really like the quality of the Schumacher products having two of their multifunction battery chargers that have worked well for over 10 years. When I saw that they offered high quality trickle chargers I bought two of them to make the switch to worry free charging. The chargers are well built and heavy for their size and the build quality is typical Schumacher. The chargers are intended to be installed in the engine compartment with battery connections that are permanently connected to the charger and for power a short plug comes out of the side of the unit and is easily connected to a grounded extension cord. I really didn't want to install these under the hood even though they supply the mounting brackets and screws required but I did like the idea of the permanent connection to the battery as opposed to a clamp which could fall off in the middle of the season and leave me with a dead battery. Remembering how the chargers connected in the Power Wheels toys my sons had several years ago, I was able to find polarity keyed plug connectors in the trailer wiring section of the local auto parts store and now have a short  pigtail permanently connected to the battery and the ability to plug and unplug it into the charger when I want. Now I have the best of all worlds, the security of a solid connection to the battery and the flexibility of being able to plug and unplug the charger with ease. I like this a lot.

I got this unit because it has been recommended by many autobody/paint folks for the homeowner garage shop and for those who wish to paint in their home shops.  I just installed it and have not had a chance to run any air through it yet, but I would like to forewarn anyone who purchases this unit.  Please remove and re-seal (i.e. tape, pipe dope, whatever) the connections on the air regulator.  Everyone one of the connections on the regulator leaked air.  I suggest you remove the 3/8 nipple that came with the unit and replace it with a 3/8 brass nipple that has the nut, so that you can use a wrench for tightening.  I just wanted to save you the time of installing and then having to break it down to reseal.

Extra foamy with the right amount of concentration. Foams very well for those seeking foam baths for the car. Smells great. It definitely leaves your car shiny and full of depth after rinsing and drying, even on aged cars that have seen better days. Foam washed my friend's 2016 Acura RDX that hadn't seen a wash since leaving the dealer, never waxed or polished, and had gone through good amount of winter weather. See the photos, I only foam washed, light scrubbing, and VOILA!

Not much to say really other than these are bright. Reaaallllly bright....so bright it looks like it's my low beam. My hid's are sharper obviously because of the projector, but these are extremely bright. I have to check the specs on my car and see if the 50W is ok to be placed in the "Blinker/parking" housing. But yes, again, very bright , which is good because that is what I was looking for.

Junk junk junk junk, did I mention these are junk? My son bought these for me around July of 2015, and it's been about 7 weeks ago now that there are already a lot of lights burnt out. I would think they should last more than 3 or 4 months. These things are absolutely JUNK! They were a bit of a pain to install but I expected that, what I did not expect was they would fail in just a few months. Do not buy these things it is a total waste of money not to mention the time it takes for install only to have lights burn out in a few months, then they look stupid with a bunch of burnt out lights. If I could give these things a negative five stars I would have, one start is to much for these junk junk junk junk junk. It was day time when I took the pictures so it's a little hard to see but the passenger side has three burnt out white lights, the drivers side has two, and the passenger side has two burnt out red ones, junk junk junk

UPDATE: After three months no problems. I increased to four starsI had a shorter version that failed (half of the LED's on one side). I discovered these are made by the same manufacturer. I guess they are sold under different branding. These are longer and just and have more LED's. They barely fit my vehicle - more LED's is good. I applied additional pure silicone sealant wherever a leak could occur. I also applied where the wires come out for stress and flexing relief. Construction quality could be better. These were my only option. They look great and are a good value. Only time will determine reliability.

Wow, these things are amazing. I really didn't expect them to perform as well as they did. I live on an island in the Caribbean (Trinidad), and I get home at night, where at least 30 minutes of my driving is done where there are no street lights and hardly any houses, so the more light the better (within legal limits of course :)!). Before I installed these in my 2005 Suzuki Jimny I had a pair of Genuine Osram 50+ bulbs (German made), which were wayyyyyyyyy better than stock. But then came these Philips X-treme power bulbs, which are much better! They are brighter and slightly whiter (not the annoying white/blue typical of blue coated bulbs) than the osrams. They give a wider and longer beam, the cut off is more defined and clean and it lights up signs and the edges of the road amazingly well. It also works great in the rain at night! All my friends like them, and want these as well! Couldn't be happier with this purchase. For the price it's more than worth it!

I purchased this carb to replace a used summit 600 dual feed I purchased used from a friend for $75 that I had nothing but problems with. Not the case with this carb. The Summit had an electric choke, this has a manual. Without the choke in use this carb fires over quicker than the summit and actually settles into an idle on a cold engine. Within 30 seconds it idles clean enough to drop in gear and drive. This carb not only idles well, but the float level was perfect out of the box, the mixture was so close that it wasn't worth the trouble of hooking up a vacuum gauge (1/16 turn rich), and it pulls clean and hard until I shift my little 289.This is a great carb that runs way better than I remember the old 1850s running. I have had one on my '65 Galaxie for over a year without a hiccup which is what led me to install this one on my '68 Cougar as well. I am NOT disappointed. For some reason I remember these carbs being problem laden as far as holding a tune a running reliably. It seems Holley has paid attention and are doing some serious quality control. These carbs are now as reliable as they are powerful. If you have a stock to semi hot small block or hot small cube engine, this is the carb for you. Would also run well on a stock larger cube engine in a big car with highway friendly gears.I have this carb on two completely different engines and cars. The '65 289 is very mild but has a high rise two plane, 1 5/8 headers, auto trans, and 3.00:1 gearing. The '68 Cougar is obviously much smaller, but has a hotter cam XE 262, two plane, flamthrower ignition, 1 5/8 headers, ported heads, 2200 stall and 3.55 gearing. It performs well on each.Oh yeah, and this aluminum version is SO much easier to install when leaning over your car. Feels like a feather compared to the old Zinc 1850s.

They worked well. Perfect white.  Used on an Infiniti g20 climate control.  On some, The leds weren't perfectly aligned on top so they would not fit in the hole on my climate control properly.  The lights where the leds were glued in the very center fit perfect and lit it up great.  No complaints, just something to watch out for.

Bought these to replace my original rear struts on my 154K Buick Regal, originals tested ok, but I figured after 154K miles they gotta be "Tired"  I replaced the fronts about a year ago; These rear struts made a HUGE difference in ride quality and handling characteristics.  I wasn't getting the full benefit of the front struts I changed out last year UNTIL I put these in.... WOW  what a difference... Next time I'll replace "all around" ... Great struts so far.... It is a little tricky getting that Last rear top Nut  out and in though ... I used  a ratcheting box wrench... Glad I got 'em you will be too..

I take it all back. Shortly after installing These Spark plugs, my car started to shack and throw an EPC code. I wasn't sure what was going on and after doing some homework I realize that these plugs are NOT for German cars. I regap them from 0.044 to 0.036, but the shacking at take off and misfiring continued. Took them out and put in NGK platinum, problem solved. Please save your money and time, thankfully Amazon prime is refunding me.I can't say these plugs did not make a ver y good noticeable difference for the very short time they were working, but clearly these are not for A FSI 4.2L, or 3.0L S5.

To start these cables are very robust in feel. And with the thick 6 gauge wires and 400 AMP rating you can jump everything up to an eighteen wheeler without thinking twice about it. Another reason I went with these cables is their 20 foot range which is just awesome! Last week I had to jump a car and used my girlfriends jump cables and had to push the dead car out of a spot to get it close enough to jump. The car was parked on an ever so slight grade so it was not easy. I ripped a huge hole in the butt of my pants.... it was quite an experience, one I will never have to deal with again thanks to these! The clamp strength of these are very powerful and with the staggered level teeth you are guaranteed to get a good attachment. The "mouth" of this also opens to over an inch so you can attach to the battery contacts at what ever angle tickles your fancy. Attached are some pictures of the cables in the supplied bag for size and storage requirements. Let me know if this helped and if you guys have any questions!

So I have a 2000 mustang (non California model).  Let me start by saying go to Dorman's website and check out the part number.  The photo shown here on amazon is not completely accurate.  The one they send is the true Dorman 674-536 and it believe it is the California model because it has an extra erg port coming off the front end (see my customer photos).  The ports come with metal caps so if you have a non cali car like mine I believe you can just snug down the port cover and you should be fine.  I will update my post if the cap ever fails but as of 10/25/2013 it is fine.  The first manifold I got looked a lot like the one on dorman's website but the quality of the welds and the details were crappy.  So I returned it to amazon for a full refund and order another.  The front tube, and the side weld of the first one were crap.  The ports were so rough that even though this was a stock replacement, ie not an upgrade, it would have performed worse.  It does come with the gasket and two bolts to attach to the down pipe/catalytic converter system.  The second one I got looks great for an oem style replacement for 70ish dollars.  I would recommend for anyone looking to replace a broken stock manifold, just keep in mind you may have to return one to get a good one.  See my photos.

This item is one of the best purchases I have made for my travel trailer so far.  The instructions are simple and easy to follow.  I am a small female, and I was able to install these myself.  The struts act as a template for drilling, which makes installation much easier.  I am including pictures of the installed product for consumers to review.  I hope this helps anyone trying to make the decision to buy.  Great company, great product.

I've wanted mud guards for my Hummer for a while because, as many reviewers have already stated, dirt and mud gets thrown all the way up to the windows and door handles by the tires. One problem is accessories for the Hummer H3 T are either difficult to find or they're overpriced. I found these but they are only shown to fit the regular H3. Not wanting to order from another retailer and pay more I took a risk and ordered these anyway and they fit perfectly! Installation took less than 30 minutes and didn't require me to remove the front wheels. These mud guards are bigger than I anticipated so they should perform well. I'll update my review when I actually see how they perform in the rain.

Installed as part of our 100,000 mile service for our 2007 Honda CRV.  Replaced the OEM NGK's that had not been touched since they were installed by the factory in Japan in late 2006.  Noticed an immediate improvement in mpg, though may also have been due to valve adjustment done at the same time.  These Denso plugs were what the dealer would have installed had we had them do the service, much cheaper here than elsewhere.  They certainly look more substantial than the original plugs.

Works great!  Like other reviews have mentioned; this is not weatherproof.  I store my trailer inside, which is helpful.  But of course, pulling it in the rain is a real possibility.  For trailers store outside, or boat trailers where the planned mounting place of the spare could become consistently submerged, I'd consider looking elsewhere.  Though, the price of this is extraordinarily cheap; so replacing it is far from a heartache.I used this to mount an 8" spare tire on the drawbar of my motorcycle cargo trailer (one pulled behind a motorcycle).  It worked just fine.  I did need spacers to make the skinny, small 8" wheel fit snugly, but that's no big deal.  I now have pulled this trailer, with the spare mounted like this, for a little over 1,000 miles at the time of this review; without issue!

This is a good price for a full sheet. The quality like everyone complains about is not noticeable. It looks great in photos and I get hundreds of complements. The only thing I don't like is something that was my own fault on the install. I used this with 3M general adhesive and a matte clear coat. No fading or peeling at all. If you are into stickerbombing this is a nice bargain for what you get and the quality isn't as bad as people say.

I would probably give this 2 1/2 Stars if it were possible.I have an '05 Rubicon and purchased the tinted window soft top. I'm not a noob with this stuff and automatically let this top sit in the sun for a couple of hours before installing. Damn if this thing still wasn't hard to put on. It was going smooth up until trying to get the flanges above the windows to clip under the frame. I noticed that it was a factory defect in the flange. It was because the flange was sewn incorrectly at the end. Trying to pull the top was really tough and i actually thought i was going to rip it because of the defect. I'm not the most patient person in the world and am too stubborn to return this, especially after all the work I've been doing on the car and taking the hard top off. I expect this to rip about the windows in the near future. If Bestop sent me a new top in the meantime, i'd take it, but like everyone else they'll need this back first. I have no time to wait for this, with top down weather winding down for the year.The top also fits loose. I expected it kind of would seeing that most all replacement tops do, but was disappointed in the sag in the side windows. The flange under one side is actually sliding out because of the sag. That's pretty poor. Guess you get what you pay for ($300 versus $800 for top quality). Most likely part of the scheme to get you to buy their lower end top once every 2-3 years.The color and new look are the best part about the top. Any little detail that is new on a Jeep makes all the difference, especially a new black top. Very happy with the color and ability to see out of clean windows.

So far I can't complain one bit.  I have winched logs, cars out of ditches, used it to lower a YJ down a steep hill, and even pulled my JKU almost vertical on its belly about 4ft when i accidently went off a small "cliff".  Definitely a nice winch for the price!  Got the neoprene cover for it, well worth the money.

2018 Ram 1500 Reg Cab 6.4 bed.THE GOOD: Bought this one hoping the TYGER cover would come instead and it did. Quality product, easy install, doesnt move around, slight flapping at highway speed (as expected). Only exposed to rain so far. Bed remained dry. Did not use the weather strip that was provided. Hopefully holds up with snow.THE OK: When looking at the back of the truck at a level view of the cover, the corners near the tailgate seem to be slightly curved up. Not a big deal and not really noticeable. Im talking about a small amount that I doubt anyone else would even realize. Also something else that isn't really that noticeable is the fact that cover is not curved in the front to follow the slight contour of the bulkhead. Also a very small detail that anyone else probably wouldnt even realize.

I own a 06 Cobalt ls with a 4 cylinder inline. I put it in, in about 10 mins and when I started my car I could hear it working already. I drove around to test it in my town and I could definitely feel a difference in the HP and the throttle response. With everything off it the car u can hear it work and when u get over 4000 rpm u can hear the intake get loud, and it gets pretty loud as u get higher in the rpms. With the radio and ac/heater on its not bad. 4 star rating. I had to trim the crank case hose to size, the below fitting was wrong, but you can use the one off the old intake. Make sure the elbow fit is in the right place because if its not it won't go in right or the engine cover won't go on. Wish it was a drop in intake. But it still is a bada@#$ intake

These are great ramps.  I had a pair of aluminum arched ramps that were just under 8 ft long.  I couldn't load my riding mower with my truck on level ground for fear of flipping it, had to back up into a ditch which was a pain.  The extra length on these ramps has fixed that problem.  I can load my mower on level ground, driving it forward into the bed or backing it up into the bed.  These ramps are also wider than my previous set, making it easier to line up, and they are much sturdier.  The ends are solid across the width, instead of a pair of "prongs" like my previous ramps.  This distributes the load instead of having point loads, making it less likely to damage the tailgate.  The included straps are a nice touch. Yes, they were expensive, but I wish had gone this route from the beginning instead of wasting time and money on a cheap set.  The shorter ones might be fine if you have a truck that's lower to the ground, but both trucks I've owned have had tailgates 36" above ground, and the 8 footers are just too steep.

Doesn't quite match my 1996 Ford Ranger as well as I had hoped it would. Even after the paint had dried for several hours and after a good buff it still isn't quite the same. But I guess maybe that is just because the truck is 15 years old and has spent all it's life outside so the paint has faded. Better than nothing though.

I ordered four of these lights for my Jeep - 2 for the rear and one for each side of the vehicle. The light output is very impressive. We used these lights for setting up our campsite in the dark almost every night of a 9-day road trip, and couldn't have asked for more. The only issue is that two of the lights show water inside, almost immediately after installation. I waited 9 months to install them so I can't get them exchanged, but I would still highly recommend these lights.

Got these for my 05 Grand Cherokee. I installed them in the high beams. They look awesome. I get compliments on them from time to time. I personally love the way they look.I wanna mention that if you are buying them for an 05-07 Grand Cherokee they will not fit into the housing out of the box. The bulbs have three embossed groves on the backside and you will not be able to turn and lock them in the housing. You have to sand those embossed groves down (I used a file, took a minute to do). After they are sanded down the bulbs lock right in. This maybe the case in other vehicles as well so don't worry if they won't lock. Odds are that's what's stopping them.I uploaded a picture to show what it looks like installed. Check it out in customer images.Enjoy!

Conditions: Humidity in our coastal region encouraged unseen corrosion between the battery and switch's underside.  Poor starting and poor operational charging incorrectly diagnosed as battery condition issue.  Dielectric grease is ineffectual.  Replacement battery soon exhibits same conditions so switch finally taken apart.Findings: The conductive brass coating corrodes off of poor unconductive pot metal main structure.Conclusion:  Inexpensive switch results in starting uncertainty and unnecessary replacement battery expense.

It took me less than 5 minutes to replace the switch in my Dayton bench top grinder.  It was a perfect match.  My old switch had two terminals and the new one had four.  No big deal, only used two of the four.The photo shows the new switch installed.

Fantastic light.  Added some my own roll bar brackets and some "seal all" to where the wire enters the housing.  There is a rubber grommet there and I'm sure it would work fine but it seemed loose so I packed sealant into it to ensure its waterproof-ness.  Overall though, great light.

Great magnetic tray. Working on cars for over 10years and was using the cardboard method to keep track of bolts. It is big enough to do valve covers and timing case on a v8 mercedes. It attached well to the radiator support. Also came in handy for the trunk and bumper disassembly.I use it more of an organization tray.

These A-Pillar Mount Brackets fit my 2016 Jeep Wrangler really well.  What didn't fit well were the foam pads on that go on the back of the brackets.  The holes on the foam pad didn't line up with the holes in the bracket.  I had to use a knife to re-cut them.  The welding on the bracket seems quality and the paint job on them was good.  The brackets fit perfectly on the Jeep and are a great fit for the spot lights I'm installing.I'd recommend these brackets even though they need a little bit of modification to the foam padding that goes on the back of them.I received this product at a discount in return for my unbiased opinion.

Seems to be about the same quality as something you'd find at Harbor Freight but for around $10 it's a bargain if used casually for pumping up bike and/or car tires every now and then. I wanted to combine a combo, two headed, Schrader/Presta bicycle pump hose&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sunlite-Twinhead-Pump-Hose-Kit-860mm-Black/dp/B002MKHR48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sunlite Twinhead Pump Hose Kit, 860mm, Black</a>&nbsp;to this and found the perfect way to do it with under $10 at the hardware store. Somebody in another review said they used a 3/16 ID Hose Barb x 1/8 inch male NPT Brass Pipe Fitting however when I tried that the male end wound up starting to strip the threads in the gun. The threads in this gun are visual courser. So, I went back to the hardware store and got two parts to make the two hoses one. In the picture it shows everything; a 1/4 barb X 1/4 female thread (for the gun tube side) combined with a 3/16 barb X 1/4 male thread (for the bicycle hose). Don't forget the hose clamps and Teflon tape!

I guess I received the unlucky poorly calibrated one.  The one I received reads 0.8 volts LOW on multiple DVM's.  There is no pot to adjust.  I am using this at the moment to monitor an RV / solar battery bank therefore accuracy is critical.  Although direct sunlight will wash the reading out, it is at a perfect brightness to leave run all night in the RV as low current draw night light.  Perhaps I should try my luck with their new 5 digit volt meters.

I had to return them. I tried desperately to get them to work as replacements for the incandescents in my RV, but only one of ten would work well. I turned them around and around trying to make sure the polarity was correct, and even fiddled with the contacts. Look closely at the photos- those wires that serve as contacts are poorly installed and probably the source of the problem- they seem to be in several (too short, mostly) lengths and sometimes bent in the wrong direction. Very poorly assembled. I'm going to look for something better.

A review and fit question definitively answered. Yes this fits a 2016 Sienna! Purchased an LE 3 days ago and the roof cross rack today from same dealer. See photos for confirmation. We used a Costco coupon received because of using their buying service. Rack at full cost is like being robbed. Fit is perfect and installation requires only a tape measure & step ladder, so easy. Amazon's price was the best I could find.Only flaw is inability to lock in place. Unscrew 4 knobs and everything is yours so minus 1 star. I will try to replace with tamper proof screws but Amazon sells the bits too.Amazon if your listening stop saying this does not fit my veichle!

Been searching for a better scraper than the lousy plastic type that ALWAYS leave gaps on the glass due to being non-flat.I had real high hopes when I saw this brass scraper and was excited to receive it and try it out.First ice/snow today and I walked to my car with a slight smile as I had thought I found the holy grail of scrapers.Well, this thing is no better than the cheap plastic ones that leave terrible results.  So saddening.  I scraped the window and to my dismay I saw what looked like I had just used a serrated blade on the glass.  The glass looked like I dragged a carpenters saw a crossed it. TERRIBLE.So, the search continues.  A company would be in the Fortune 500 if they could invent a perfect ice scraper. (same with wiper blades).  No one has done it yet.

I was having trouble finding a well rated and priced floor jack. I honestly couldn't find one that fit in the price range I wanted, so I bought a used one of these for $115. That makes this one of the best purchases I've made this year! It's saved me a ton of money by allowing me to get under the car and perform some of the easier DIY car work. The package that arrived was really heavy, but based on my reading and other reviews, this is lighter than most floor jacks.The minimal assembly was pretty straight forward (3 parts). It's easy to use and gets the job done. When I was shopping around, I was looking for pictures of the floor jacks in use and couldn't find any for this one, so I've posted 2 photos of just that. You can check them out in the product gallery. I love this floor jack and couldn't find a better deal on Amazon.One difficulty I've had is rolling this around in tight spaces (my 1 car garage when the car is in). Only one set of wheels swivel, making it a little difficult to maneuver around tight corners to get it from one side of my car to the other. It's a nitpick, but I thought I'd mention it.

I installed two of these on my Polaris Ranger.  They are very bright and the quality is great. I coupled these with a 20" LED bar for a fantastic result.  The only minor complaint was that the two brackets supplied for mounting had different aesthetic shapes.  Dimensions were same/fine and it isn't noticeable even when looking directly at it but it was strange that they were slightly different.  I'm very satisfied with the performance and it leaves nothing lacking.

I got my cargo cover today, and got installed on my 2008 honda element ex. It looks good except for the packaging. The box was smushed on the bottom and the plastic covering the cargo was in looked like a rat chewed it. That's why i gave it 4 stars. Other than that, it looks good in my element. There is about a 1 1/2'' gap from the cover to the seats. And as for the sound damping, you'll still here road noise even with this installed in the back.

Bought two of these for my 2002 Ford F-350 Super Duty 7.3L Powerstroke Diesel.  These engines need a lot of cranking power, and options are narrowing as time goes on.  In the past, there have been good options for high Cold Cranking Amp (CCA) batteries such as Motorcraft BSD-65 (900 CCA) or what I had most recently, the Motorcraft BXT-65-850 (850 CCA), neither of which is available anymore.  Sears used to offer an Odyssey-equivalent, made by the same company Enersys and re-branded as Sears Die Hard Platinum AGM (absorbed glass mat); however, this too has been discontinued.The next level down AGM was a Sears Gold AGM, but this only has 775 CCA.  It would still start, but I don't like to mess around with things like this.  I think the "major" brands don't find it profitable to sell a high cranking battery, as most folks don't need them.  So, I had to go a bit more high end to get the cranking I wanted - enter the Odyssey 65-PC1750T.  These things are MONSTERS with 950 CCA - even higher than the long-gone, rare, and coveted Motorcraft BSD-65.Absorbed Glass Matt (AGM) is awesome!  Never have to check the electrolyte level again, no venting/spilling/etc.  My truck also sits a lot, and these batteries handle that well as they are both a "sprinter" (high burst cranking) and a "long distance runner" (capable of deep discharging and re-charging).  Most batteries are one or the other.These are expensive, but you get what you pay for.  Super high quality.  Mega cranking.  Just check the weight on these bad boys - SIXTY POUNDS of pure lead.  Other batteries such as Optima Red Top for my application are about 38 pounds.

Fit my 2013 Mazda 3 perfectly. Dont know if the picture shows it but the filter material is a lot thicker. You could see through the original. Might restrict air flow but would filter the air a lot better, Ill have to see if I can tell the difference. 2nd picture shows the oem being thicker don't think thats a problem this one fit good and they even lock together where the stock one just set on top.

I bought this product March of this year and haven't experienced any problems so far. I bought this handle, along with 3 other mechanical handles, to replace the original handles that came with my rig. RVLock matched the keys so I only have to carry 1 key for 4 different locks, which is great! The keyless function is pretty cool. Installation was a breeze. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.

Theyre pretty good. I wanted a nice liner that wasn't too slippery when dry. They are both things. The fit on the drivers side is perfect, including the gas cap release and the factory locks (see attached photo). The rear mat fits okay. But the passenger sides mat fit the shape generally, but its bowed along the side, and not as tight of a fit as the driver side. Perhaps it will settle being out of the box, but I doubt it.Overall, Im satisfied. Ive included some photos, since there really weren't any customer photos along with any of these other suspiciously-glowing reviews.

I was worried because the product image looked like every comparable product.  I ordered one at first since it was ten dollars cheaper than the competitors, I was happy with the fit and finish so ordered 3 more.  The steel and welds looked high quality and it fit my stake pockets great.  It has two holes for the pin so depending on the hight of your stake pocket it will still fit.

This grille is a direct replacement for my 1999 4wd standard cab Toyota Tacoma.  The quality of the materials and fittment far exceeded my expectations. This is produced by a company called Profortune that is ISO 9001 certified.  Grille arrived in perfect condition without a scratch. In fact it came so well packed, Toyota OEM needs to take note.  Why spend the $$ on OEM when you can get parts like this that are indistinguishable.

The reverse light section sucks. No real reflector to get the light out of the housing. I've seen candles with better lighting. Seriously.The rest of the unit seems to be well put together. Bright but not too bright. the small 3 LED side marker could be bigger or brighter for safety purposes. I'm seriously considering opening the shell and building my own 36 LED plate of High Flux white LED's and adding to the side marker portion. But we'll see. The lens blends right into my black F150. 4*'s for a crappy reverse light.

Description clearly states the end hole is 1/2" BUT ONLY ONE END IS 1/2" the other end is only 1/4" way too small to attach to the normal post on the battery.  I notified Amazon of the incorrect product description. If everyone does this perhaps they will change the description and more people will not have the same experience. In addition to having an incorrect product description these cables are very light weight. I would seriously worry using them on a car battery. The photo on the package shows a lawn mower.  They are certainly NOT heavy duty as described. I've included a photo with a regular battery cable in my RV so you can see how much smaller and  light weight they are.  DON'T buy these unless you are getting them for a lawn mower. NOT for anything larger.

This is a great inexpensive add on that will come in handy on long trips when you need a little relief, Installation was simple and the directions are thorough. You can also find step-by-step videos online if you need it.I have a modified 01 Honda Shadow with Avon grips and it fit very well after trimming the thinner rubber as directed on the instructions.I know it doesn't look amazing but most people barely notice it. I also know it doesn't come off when you hit the brakes in case of emergency like its 180$ counterparts... but you can easily unlock it - or you can slide the throttle back even with it still locked, or just pull the darn clutch in and apply the brakes as you would in any emergency. There are more than one way to stop/slow down a bike. Sure your bike will rev high for an instant if you pull the clutch in with the throttle locked... but you won't crash - not because of the product, at least.There are several more expensive versions of this product but i was OK saving that money for other things. This product is what I expected. An inexpensive way to let me move my right hand away from the throttle (or both hands for some "Look, Mom! No hands!" pictures - I'm not suggesting it but let's be honest, we've all done it).

I have a 2007 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara with a Kargo Master "Congo Cage" frame (approx 1 1/4" steel tube).The Smittybuilt 2787 (~6'x6') Awning fits perfectly between the cage's vertical legs.The box contained everything I needed, plus extra bolts and nuts which appear to be high quality stainless, but ?Installation on my setup was as simple as determining the position, wrenching on the u-bolts and L brackets to my cage, then hanging the self contained awning on the brackets...it took me about 20 minutes since I did not have to fabricate or modify anything on my vehicle.The L brackets could be installed pointing up or down;  On my "un-lifted" stock suspension, I found the pointing up provided ampleoverhead space...I am 5'10"; pointing down would mean taller folks would have to stoop...the awning would be just slightly higher than height of the Jeep's roof.The instrux say to install the u-bolts with the nuts upwards;  I am not sure why, however I did not want to have water pooling in them and causing corrosion so mounted them downwards.  I also added a piece of foam window seal under the u-bolt to prevent it from slipping around the cage tube...after torqueing down the u-bolt, it feels like it is not going to move at all.To deploy the awning takes me literally two minutes (without the guy ropes).  Unzip the cover and flip it back; unroll the awning; drop the legs from the outer frame, then extend the horizontal arms. Insert the arm pins into the outer horizontal frame, and extend the arms until the awning is taut.  Adjust the leg heights as desired. Take down is just as quick, same steps in reverse.One thing I would look out for are the pins on the horizontal arms which insert into the outer horizontal frame.  These pins are pretty thin aluminum and I already put a very slight bend into one when I first tried to set it up...the whole thing leaned/fell over before I could get the second arm in and slightly torqued the pin.  I find that by really angling the legs towards the vehicle (like a lean -to) helps stabilize the awning until getting the second arm in.  Once together, it is very stable/free standing.One can lower the outer edge a few inches, but if you want to really pitch the awning, like for rain, it works better to angle the legs towards the vehicle and tension with the guy ropes.  Trying to simply lower the outer legs more than a few inches will put torque on the outer end arm pins and on the arm hinges on the vehicle end (which are horizontal axis only).Overall I am really pleased with this product;  so pleased, in fact,that I am buying another one for the other side of the Jeep so I can have awnings on both sides :)

Durable, thick, looks great, grippy to keep things from sliding, has spikes on bottom for air flow, cutouts for tie down D rings. Great buy and Im super happy.  This fit my 2018 Tacoma doublecab short-bed perfectly.

UPDATE:  Measured brightness with digital light meter at 25 feet awayWorn out stock H7: 380 lux (23% dimmer than new stock)New stock H7: 515 lux (baseline)THIS PRODUCT: 550 lux (6.7% brighter than stock)Slightly brighter and whiter, but these will not magically make poorly designed or old faded headlights work great.  Check if other electrical issues are causing poor output, such as corroded / loose connections or weak alternator.  Use rubber gloves to install and clean bulbs with rubbing alcohol and a lint free cloth, or they may fail very quickly.The +130% claim is only true for a hotspot in some very specific lab test, not 130% brighter at every part of the beam (that would need impractical and illegally high output).  Each headlight design will have a different pattern.  The longer distance claim probably means something upright like a guard rail shows up sooner, not that the flat road surface is suddenly well lit at those distances (again, that would need ridiculously high output).  Color temperature is tested at specific lab conditions and 3700K is still warm, so these will not give a blue "HID style" look, nor do they claim to do so.

Easy to apply and seems like good quality. It formed over a bend on the gas can towards the middle of the sticker pretty good. Will help make sure the proper gas is used in my trimmer/mowers.

Much whiter than original 578 interior bulbs. Brighter too but not a ridiculous amount brighter. If the bulb doesn't work when fist put into clips... Reverse the bulb to match polarity and it should work. I thought I had two bulbs that didn't work but all I did was flip it around and it worked. Hopefully they will last. The original bulbs were very hot when removing them. These are totally cool. I would recommend them as a simple upgrade.

Do not buy this kind of sensor for use in a Honda and probably other makes as well. The probe end is not correct. Honda OEM Sensors have a highly perforated sensor. This has one hole in it. This leads to occasional engine lag and overall sluggishness.My problems with went away instantly when I installed the Denso part that looked the same as OEM

Perfect replacement on my 99 Dodge Dakota Sport 5.2 4x4.  The arm telescopes so don't panic if it is "too short"  Had no issues with the wheel being crooked, mine was perfectly fine.  Make sure you disconnect the battery before working on the steering column to avoid any airbag issues.  Took me about 3 hours from start to finish.  I am BRAND NEW to working on cars, this was actually the first thing I replaced on this vehicle but hopefully by the time I am done it will be running strong.  5 stars for a perfect fit and quality.Important note, this does not come with any bolts or nuts, so you need to reuse what you have.  If they are rusty you can get replacement bolts but they are a chrysler specific part but a generic bolt with a slightly larger head and a washer seemed to do the trick just fine.I will update in the future if there is any issues down there road.  But atleast now I won't be swimming all over the road as I drive to town!

Have had several HID kits over the past decade for various vehicles.  This is a good one to get.I really like that the ballasts have a distinctly different look than other sellers, are very slim and produced a bright flicker-free light.  I guess the 55w really does make a difference because they really stand out compared to a 35w kit I own.I used these as my fog lights and ordered the 5000k bulbs which produced a nice white with just a hint of blue.The box came packaged well, instructions were provided and two sided sticky pads that cover the entire ballasts.  Shipping was very fast.I am very pleased with what I got and considered the price to be very competitive.  Highly recommended!

This is a very high quality gasket. I used it to fix the notorious oil pan leak on a Firebird. I really like the larger sealing bead on the oil-pan side. My OE gasket was leaking between the pan and gasket, not the block and gasket so it's great that this company made the effort to correct that because on an F-body, you do not want to do this job twice. Very happy to not see quarter sized stains of oil everywhere I go. I opted to not use RTV in the corners for two main reasons. One, the OE gasket didn't use any - the sealing area at the casting junctions is beefier and seals just fine. Two, the paper gaskets from the rear seal housing and timing chain cover hang down ever so slightly so when the pan is torqued into place it will "push" into the bead creating a seal. I typically buy Fel-Pro stuff but I'm very glad I opted for the Magnum on this application. Fel-Pro outsources much of their production anymore these days but this gasket is USA made... all the more reason to buy it!

A good stand at a good value . I am using this to lift my Harley Vrod for minor servicing and repairs .It feels a bit weak and has a tendency to bend in one way (they back heavy side of the bike ) . I was worried when I saw that , but it did not break ( hehe) . I even left my bike and kept it up for almost a week. I recommend you center the front wheel and strap the handlebar to the rear foot pegs .I prefer a manual lift for my project ,  because I read reviews the hydraulic ones tend to slowly drop , and I didn't want to lose an expensive bike .I wish the cisors where built differently and not bend , but its not a deal breaker for the price, it paid itself after 1 usage .Using the stand would be safer and easier with 2 people, at least to center the bike and keep it leveled off the jiffy while the other person cranks the socket wrench , until the bike holds leveled , then the rest can be done alone . Its not impossible to do it alone , but I feel its safer with two people .Note : it is more stable and doesnt bend when the bike is just centered and not lifted off the ground .I used the stand a few times and kinda center stand to check oil levels , or polish chromes . I am very confortable using it as center stand! Leaving it like that for extended period , but keeping the front wheel on the ground .I will reach out to the company and ask if thats normal or if my unit has a defect .

Great fit on my 2016 JK, easy to install don't need instructions. Fat screws fit the outside corners skinny fit the inside corners its the same size as what come out just a tad bit longer to fit the spacers, then place the white spacers between the metal guard and the light since the guard is flat and the light have a slight outward bulge

These are awesome little units. I have used them for many purposes but my favorite was some portable 12V power boxes I made. I used these displays to monitor the load on the power supplies and also to see the current charge level in order to know when to swap them out. Worked perfectly. Also use them in my RV to monitor solar performance and battery levels.

here is the symptoms and reason why I purchased this.02 honda civic 1.7 ex automatic 4 door I started smelling gas inside of my car.I removed back seat and was shocked to find a puddle of gas under back seat fuel pump inspection cover.so I decided to inspect a Little Closer so I removed the backseat take off the fuel pump cover and immediately found the problem if you look online this is a very common issue with this generation Civic so upon closer inspection you will notice hairline cracks on the top portion of the fuel pump which is actually the fuel filter I read in other threads that the dealership recommends you replace fuel pump if you have this problem the only problem with that is the fuel pump is $350 from the factory versus $20 bucks here come on it's a no-brainer this replacement part which is actually the fuel filter in case you were wondering fits exactly as should just be very careful working around fuel also take your time when disassembling it involves connecting two harnesses and two hoses everything is self-explanatory you cannot get it backwards it only goes one way it took me about 40 minutes in my driveway trust me you can do it. here are some pictures.

Upon initial inspection I can say a couple of things: (Installed on a 2012 Suzuki Boulevard S40)Pros:- Seems to be made of a good quality, lightweight polyester (which reminds me of an Eno Nest Hammock)- Protects the bike from dust, UV, and light rain- Has a built in bungee and grommet system which keeps the cover firmly on the bike- Comes in a small compression sack for storageCons:- Runs small (the product selection recommended a Medium, I installed a Large and would have gone for and XL after seeing how this one fits.)**If you have a rear seat or windshield, keep this in mind. I do not have either installed, but it does not seem to have much excess material in those areas. It fits pretty snug with just my side saddle bags and is pretty tight across the handlebars)**- The elastic band is pretty tight which makes it a little cumbersome to install and take off, but may be good if its on a trailer.

It just feels cheap, not like many of the other products they sell of their own, but there's a good reason why. At first I thought I received the wrong product, or at least mixed it up in my assorted box of brushes I purchased from Amazon, since it didn't say Chemical Guys on the brush, in fact it had the name of a discount car care manufacturer "Carrand" right there on the handle. Although Chemical Guys makes (or at least sells) great products, it should be known that at least some are manufactured by other companies.Although this is normal in this kind of industry, what isn't to be expected of a company that markets their products to many professional detailers, and car enthusiasts willing to pay a premium over the discount products (and discount quality) sold at every auto parts store, is that products like this are actually manufactured (and logo'd), by Carrand. In fact, Carrand sells the very same item as "<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Carrand-93017-Grip-Tech-Sheepskin-Wheel-Cleaner/dp/B0009VF1AY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Carrand 93017 Grip Tech Sheepskin Wheel Cleaner</a>",. Some of their other self branded items include grit guard, but it is sold for a comparable price (although overpriced for what it is).I now understand why this Chemical Guys product had gotten such poor reviews on Amazon, and I should have taken heed, rather than just expecting quality products because of what I thought was a brand name, rather than a company selling repackaged products from other manufacturers. Honestly, after receiving the product, I already initiated a return, since it's not the quality product I assumed. I can get the same result by folding a thick sock (fuzzy If I choose) over on itself, and possibly with a sponge/tube sock center for absorption like this product is intended. Plus, it won't shed like crazy starting during the first use, like many other reviewers seem to complain about. For $3-4 it would be OK, but not for $8.82, or even the $6.58 that the "Carrand" is listed for on Amazon, but possibly the $4.75 it sells for on Autoplicity.

Not only it is about 1/4 of an inch bigger than the original size, the rubber edge is too fat too. Very low quality also.I bought this air filter for my 2003 VW Passat 1.8T. After 20 min of struggling with the cover of air filter compartment, which is in one of the hardest to reach and see location in the engine bay, I noticed it's too big and does not fit in the compartment. I realized that after, I'd already bent one of the 4 clips that hold the cover in its place. Extremely disappointed. It's poorly made filter too. It should be error in manufacturing or mistake made by Amazon to say it fits in my car.

Very pleased with them. Much brighter light than stock bulbs and were easy to install. They arrived on time as advertised and package was well protected against any brakeage. I kind of wished I would have purchased the 360 degree version to see how much better / or not the light coverage was.There was only one bulb out of the pack that did not work, but I only needed six for my trucks interior application. LED`s are the way to go. I have them now for my driving , turn signal, license plate, back up and Stop lights. HID `s and Halo`s (see photo) for head lights for over a year and have been very pleased with LED`s

This helmet fits very well. Used the size chart and my head measurement and it was a perfect fit. Used it for a long weekend of about 100 miles of high-speed agressive trail riding on my TRX450R in 92 degree heat. My head did not get sweaty much at all and the helmet was very comfortable the entire time.

Added this to my 2009 Jeep Wrangler so that I could mount a plow. Product is well built and finish looks durable. Instructions were clear and installation was straightforward. You do have to modify the plastic shield under the front of the Jeep if you want to reattach it, but I just opted to go without and put the shield in storage. While I was plowing, I slammed into some deep snow that redirected the path of my Jeep with no noticeable damage to the hitch, so it seems to be pretty tough.

Why I picked the Rhino-Rack came down to fitment, weight limit, and mounting hardware.  I looked at several other racks for a couple weeks from Curt, Rola, Yakima, Highland, Pro Series and many others.  Most did not have bar spacing that matched exactly the same center widths as my OEM style cross bars (27.5" center-to-center).  Even though the manufacturers state they would fit, the mounts wouldn't be centered on the bars.Also, I didn't like the wing-nut type hardware used by most of those manufacturers, that often stick up above the basket floor and thus would uneven your load or even damage your bags/load etc.  The weight limit of many of these other baskets also rarely exceeded 130 lbs, even though my cross bars are rated up to 165 lbs, so they seemed to be engineered to lower weight tolerances etc.So the Rhino-Rack kept coming back to the top of my list because it had the universal fitment of cross bar widths between 21-30", being adjustable to any lengths in between there, and also able to choose just how far forward or back you wanted the basket sitting over your cross bars (you'll note that I didn't center mine completely between the two bars cause I wanted it sitting back farther to not obstruct the moonroof).  The mounting hardware is also flush with the basket floor and uses keyed alan bolts for security (have to use the special wrench provided, makes it harder for a thief to remove etc).  The Rhino-Rack XTray is also rated to 165 lbs, which means it is over engineered for my needs so I'll have less worry of it failing and dumping my load while off-roading etc.Other pluses to the Rhino-Rack is the slim fairing/deflector, which means it will have less drag and surface area to effect your MPG at high speeds.  The Xtray is also a deeper basket than most, having over 5" inside walls on the sides and over 4" on the front.  I liked some of the slim baskets from other vendors (particularly the Rola), but worried about stability during side-to-side rocking while off-roading etc.I've only had the rack on for a week now, and haven't actually made it camping or used it for loads yet.  However, at speeds under 40, it goes unnoticed, both sound wise and MPG.  Over 40 mph you will begin to hear the rushing air around it, progressively louder the faster you go.  It doesn't whistle though, and the noise can be mitigated with louder music :P.  MPG wise I think it definitely drops you a couple MPG at freeways speeds, but such is the price of vanity and utility.  I still averaged over 27 MPG this morning at 70 MPH for a 50 mile round trip.  That's awesome compared to the 21 MPG I rarely achieved with my Honda Pilot ;)I plan to use mine for camping mostly.  Just need to get a weekend free lol.  Anyways, I hope that helps you in your search for a basket.  At the time of my purchase, Amazon had the best price and free 2-day shipping on the Rhino-Rack.  eTrailer.com had the best price and availability on the Rola basket I liked.  Good luck in your search.*** UPDATE 7/1/2014 ***  This Rhino had to be tamed!After accruing some more highway/freeway miles with this empty rack on my CR-V, the howling at speeds over 50 MPH got to be more annoying and dronning than I had at first anticipated.  It was like being in a wind-tunnel, at 80 MPH, standing next to a Rhino :-p  Okay, maybe not that bad, but the howling/rushing-air noise at minimum doubled the wind noise at highways speeds.  So now for the solution: I added another custom fairing to the bottom half of the front of the basket, right below the included fairing (slanting the opposite direction to direct air around the bottom of the basket, along the roof etc).I took a 27.5" inch long piece of composite 2-1/4" casing/baseboard-moulding from Home Depot, painted the front black with plasti-dip, placed strips of double-sided 3M outdoor tabe along the bottom edge and along the back, top-edge, and then mounted it to the front bottom rail and forward most rail (where the other fairing mounts.  I then used black Silicon II caulking along the top and bottom edges, front and back, to seal the edges to avoid whislting.  Presto!  Howling/wind-tunnel sound is now all but gone, and only noticeable if the moonroof shade is open, and at speeds of 70 MPH or higher.  With the shade closed, it's like it's not even there, even quieter than my bare cross bars were with no rack.  I'll try add some images for better visualization.  I think the visual appearance may have even improved with the added fairing.* I removed 1 Star from my review because of the wind noise at highway speeds, requiring my own custom solution.

all I can say about this new product of kensum, is that it's GREAT  !!! ..I had the chance to try it at home with different soccer balls of my son, but the real test was when I had a flat tire  on a travel through the highway . this little guy a lifesaver.!!like all kensum product, comes in a perfect case to each product. the case is sturdy and comfortable to keep the compressor kit in the trunk of the car.But the biggest advantage is that is able to connect it to the cigarette lighter car, that's the best.the compressor is really easy to use, fully manageable, lightweight and durable, the length of the cord is appropriate for reaching 4 tires without any problem. the air pipe is resistant as well.only use the proper nozzle to connect the compressor and turn it on. the air pressure can be clearly seen on the meter.this kensum product in the automotive line is really really good.100% recommended. i love it !!!

The lights are great  I have a switchblade windshield and the lights fit without the extension.  Using the shorter "bolt spacers" provides the distance needed to mount under the windshield. The only reason I gave the lights four (4) stars was because of the wiring.  The wiring was very straightforward; however, there is no place to run the wires from the lights to the main headlight.  I had to route the wires around the down tubes, and I wrapped them in chrome wire covers.It looks great!  It would be nice if there were slots where you could run the wires through the bar and out the center so the wires would be less visible.  The quality is exceptional.  The look is great.

A must have if you drive around with your freedom tops off!  It helps keep cabin wind noise down.  You can install it with the hard top on, but you will need something to help you fish the elastic through the tight spots like weed whacked line or fishing line.  Did the trick for me and it looks cool.  I let it warm up in the sun for a few hours before install.  The wrinkles have worked themselves all out.  Great product!

*** Update **** Well, im glad I ordered a replacement because there's a 110% difference from my first order. This second set looks exactly the same, but it's a world of difference. It's firm, and actually holds the position I put it in. Haven't been on the highway yet, but if this new set performs as good as it feels, it shouldn't be flapping in at highway speeds. Definitely a difference.Original postI love the idea, these are awesome. Exactly what I need for soft doors, half doors, no doors...in theory. No matter HOW HARD I crank these down, they won't stay put. With my soft canvas doors, any time myself or a passenger opens them, they hit the mirrors, and require meticulous adjustments to get them back to how they were. The passenger side one, I don't even bother to adjust because I can't see it with the soft uppers on anyway. No doors or half doors, it's a little bit more practical, they don't get pushed out of the way anytime a door opens...but don't even think about driving on the highway, because the least bit of wind resistance sends these mirrors slapping flat against the door, going from functional mirrors to glass on a stick in a matter of seconds.Look, I wanna be able to run half doors or no doors, and for $15 or so, just having a set of mirrors so I don't get bothered by police, that's acceptable to me. But if I'm paying this much for a set of mirrors, there's no reason they should be rendered useless at any speeds above 50 mph, that's ridiculous. I ordered a replacement, I'm hoping the quality will be significantly better. If it is, I will definitely post a positive update. But like I said, no matter how hard I crank them down, they won't stay put!Like another buyer said, I'm gonna try to use a piece of rubber or lock washer, or something to make these mirrors stay put, but for the price, they shouldn't require any adjustment at all. It's such a shame because this product is such a great idea, I just wish they took the extra time to design it to an acceptable quality

I bought this oiler, along with several other "Goldenrod" oilers... I thought they would be high quality because they were made in usa.... I was wrong.This particular oiler was filled with WD-40 and after a few days of use, it started developing multiple leaks (at the base/seam , lid and spout base.For the purpose of this review, I mixed UV dye in the oilier with my WD-40, then took pictures using a UV light.  It clearly shows the problem areas.If you are looking for a oil can that gets your hands oily with each use and always leaves a puddle of oil on your workstation, then you have found a match! Look no further.

Got these for my 06 silverado and they work great but the fitment is not perfect and it took some modifying  to get them close but still not perfect therefore I'll give them 3 stars

Received these LED's on Wednesday and initial inspection looked promising.  Bench tested them to be sure they were functioning and they both checked out.  Went and installed them on Thursday and they were way brighter than the stock type bulbs and "cheap" LED's I've used prior.  However, after a few minutes, they began to overheat and gave off a burning smell.  When I went to remove the first bulb, I noticed that the top half of the bulb had fallen off completely and was sitting of the floor of my car.  I realized that it had gotten hot enough to melt the solder connecting the top lens assembly.  I rushed to remove the other bulb, which had gotten just as hot, and as I pulled it out of the fixture, the bulb completely fell apart, burning my finger and leaving a small blister in the process.  I have pictures of the bulbs attached.  Like another reviewer stated, the top lens started to melt and bubble, as can be seen in my last pic.  They were pretty bright while they functioned, but they self-destructed in a matter of minutes.  Maybe I got a bad set, but these could be potentially dangerous and I would not recommend them.  I will be pursuing a refund immediately.

This thing is so much fun! Installation was a little tricky since I put this on a 2015 Denali HD pickup truck. It was new so I was stressed about removing panels and stuff like that. It is decently loud and very surprising. I use this for the stupid people who come in my lane while they are texting and driving. It works great for that! Scares the you know what out of them. I have had this 3 years without a single issue. I mounted the compressor unit under my rear seat. It is fairly quite. The air hose is kind of cheap, but it is working for 3 years so you decide if that is cheap.

Not a whole lot to say, it slid right in, and wala .. got myself a ball mount. Seems high quality although I haven't had the chance to really put it through it's paces yet, (just installed it yesterday). I have read the other reviews about the ball being "locked" in place and I may (probably will at some point) run into that issue myself, but as of now, no problems.

Once lifted and the air dam is removed I started to get hood flutter at high speeds. Figured this would do the job and it did. Looks great and installed in 30 minutes. Requires a 10 and 13 mm socket wrench and an Allen wrench. Remove the front grill for easy access.

We purchased this too use in our travel trailer too cover the vented window that is in the roof.In the morning we like to sleep in, so instead of letting the sun blare in our face we installedthis retractable vent shade. It was really easy to install just by removing the existing screws thathold the frame in place and lining up the holes in the shade and replacing the screws and wallah.It has a small screw to add to the other side too hold it shut. This works like a shade in the homejust pull it out and when you are ready to close it, there is a small button on the end too push toorelease it. It has worked out pretty good for us. There is a bit of a gap along the back edge thatallows some light to come in, but it does keep most of the light out so it hasn't been that bad. Ithink with a little bit of redesigning it could cover the entire hole without the gap. Overall it isn't badand it is made pretty well considering it isn't something that you are opening and closing a lot.

Just got it and installed it in less than 5 minutes. Holds my Samsung Galaxy S6 and Otterbox nicely. Happy so far, will update after taking the JK off-road. See if it holds the phone snugly or if it vibrates out.4/2017 - I have taken it off-road several times and it works great. The mount vibrated with the car (as expected) but the phone held snug and my go pro took great video. (I attached a pic of the adaptor I had to buy to use my go pro.)9/2017 - Almost a year later and several off-road trips, I'm still happy with my purchase. It has loosened itself a bit. I took it off, tightened the part that holds the phone and re-installed it. I noticed it left marks where the hard plastic meets the soft. I'm not too worried since I hadn't planned on permanently removing the mount. Just a heads up in case that is something that is important to you. There are several reviews that talk about fixing that issue though...I recommend this product.

I was excited about installing this on my truck, but as soon as I opened the package, my enthusiasm dwindled down to naught.Very poor quality control; if you take a look at the pictures, you will see that one of the metal screw inserts for the MAF is quite crooked, and that the plastic mating surface is uneven. Talk about not sealing correctly.I don't think I'll buy from Volant in the future.

For the price, you really cant beat these projectors. I bought these for a headlight retrofit project on a 2000 Toyota MR2 Spyder and I was not disappointed. The projectors have a sharp cutoff line, and good projection when the high-beam flap is activated. Installation was easy due to adapter plates included, but the locking nut was a bit on the thin side. My one headlight locked in perfectly, but the other began to spin in place. This kit did include some shrouds (which I blacked out), but it did not include the mounting screws to attach the shroud to the projector.  I would re-buy these projectors for my next project.

Fit like a glove. I don't know why some people were complaining about the wires being too short on here, they are plenty long. The wire connectors were the right size to crimp the wires correctly. Took less than 15 minutes to install. Everything in this kit fit perfectly without cutting. I did take the advice of others and clean the ground box connection under the hood on the passenger side in case this was the root cause of this issue. See pics of old connectors that were fried out.

Provides what is promised. 4000k color from halogen bulbs with clean equal distribution of lighting. Farther for sure, whiter for sure. Love how I don't have to modify my car by splicing, cutting, adding harness, code canceler, or anything that will blind on coming traffic. You will be 95% happy if you are not excessive HID brightness. For halogens these provide clean 4000k look. Easy to install. I believe PIAA gives 1 years warranty.I said 95% happy for a reason. IF they last 1.5 years, 100% happy. Never owned PIAA, anything over 1.5 years, and i'll be happy!

I needed a muffler for my Jeep.  I read the other reviews, and was torn between this, or just buying a universal fit muffler and some pre-bent pieces, and welding up something myself.  I'm not planning to keep this Jeep much longer, so I figured this would be the path of least resistance, but I'm not sure if it worked out that way.I can confirm that the other reviewers are correct, this will show up at your door unboxed.  Just a muffler with your name on it.  Literally.Mine came through with the inlet pipe flattened on the one side (see first pic), and some other imperfections.  The I.D. of the inlet is a real tight squeeze over your existing exhaust piping (which is normally a good thing, you'd want a tight seal), but I spent the better part of 30 minutes carefully banging out what either the manufacturer or UPS thought was an appropriate approximation of "round", and still had a bugger of a time getting it to slide onto the pipe, even with the correct prep on the mating surfaces.Overall, this muffler was a little shorter than the original (see second pic), but not enough to mess anything up.The bigger issue was hanger placement.  The driver's side was fine, but the passenger side one was too low by 2.5" (which would raise the muffler 2.5", relative to stock, on the passenger side).  See third pic.  There's no room under the Jeep to raise just the passenger side 2.5", so this hanger had to be relocated.  I was about to grab a cut-off wheel, to cut off the hanger, and weld it back on at the proper angle, but I decided to try bending the hanger by hand first, and it was pretty easy to get it in the right position.  But I didn't bend the bracket, the whole bracket just rotated about 20 degrees where it was welded to the muffler housing.  If it was that easy to bend it at the weld by hand, I'm certain those hangers aren't going to stay attached to the muffler too long.  Just not correctly fastened.Overall, it wasn't horrible.  Took about 90 minutes, which was probably twice as long as it should have, but it's done.I ordered an exhaust hanger removal tool (funky looking pliers) with this muffler, and it made the job easier.  I've done lots of exhaust work without that tool, but it made things easier.

If you have 2" of lift or more, I recommend this product. I have 2" and the appropriatly large bump-stops and there's no problem with clearance. With stock bump stops, however, they could possibly collide with the upper wheel well but I can't say for sure.When removing my hold ones, they actually snapped from just the little amount of torque trying to get the nut off. That is because they where so rust corroded that the metal was very weak. That is why I recommend this upgrade! The Jeep isn't that rusty either, but the sway bar links sure were.I've added a picture of these sway bar links vs the stock ones for size comparisson

I just received the WeatherTech FloorLiner front mats for my 2009 Honda Fit today, and they dropped into place perfectly right out of the box! After 3 1/2 years with the all-weather Honda rubber mats, a big heel hole had worn through by the gas pedal on the driver mat, and the edge had torn off the passenger mat. The rubber nubs on the bottom of both mats wore off over a year ago. I've purchased the thick WeatherTech rubber mats for most of the past 6 cars I've owned because they last, fit great and the rubber doesn't get hard or brittle in the winter. Now that I'm living in a warmer climate, I could have chosen a carpet mat, but still went with the WeatherTech, only I decided to spend a little more and upgrade to the custom fit FloorLiner. I'm soooooo glad that I did - these liners are AWESOME, and well worth the extra cost. Sand, mud, stones, water - it doesn't matter now. I posted some pics for reference.

See i usually always get my products from places i have biught from before. Maybe its a comfort thing ir maybe im use to getting goid products and don't have to worry if i have to return it or not and take time out of my day to do it. But once i got this shield i knew before i even installed it that it wouldnt dissappoint. And guess what people, i was rite. And supprised the co. Even gives you a link how to properly install it. If you haven't done it before like me. So i made my utube video on how to install it on my scooter which is the genuine rough house cause before me. There were no videos on how too's. Or which products are the bstter ones and which ones last the longest or is best for your scooter. Now i can do that for you people. Not to get known you barely see me at all in my videos. You see whats important and thats the product and mking sure it fits rite and that its rite for you not only your scooter. So thank you for making a great product that i didn't have to spend $100 on like these others. And this wind shield will fit on mostly all scooters at least 50cc to 150cc. This is Big Bubba saying see you next time.

I always buy OEM parts for my cars whenever it is possible as experience tells me it is always better to go for OEM parts for certain critical parts even if it costs little bit more. I also love doing self repair jobs on my cars as and when it is possible. Changing motor Oil and Oil filter is something one can do if you are mechanically inclined. Placement of Oil Filters where no human hands could reach in certain model cars does seem intentional. Manufacturers do make this job little bit more complicated than usual and IMHO intentionally so that they can get customers into their dealers and possibly get more business from customers.Well, There is nothing wrong in that and some dealers actually do pretty good job of changing oil and oil filter while they also rotate tires for you. Some FORD dealers also wash the car for you all under $50 dollars. But there are some chances that you may get unlucky and some untrained rookie technicians may screw your car up and certain dealers can be very pushy to get that 'non-essential' job done when you bring in your car for regular oil change. Once they manage to put the fear in you that this is going to go bad soon you have no choice but to shell out additional dollars for that peace of mind which in most cases not really needed for several more years of your car's life.Changing the recommended&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/5W-20-Synthetic-Motor-Oil/dp/B000SM6OD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">5W-20 Synthetic Motor Oil</a>&nbsp;and using this OEM&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Motorcraft-FL2017B-Oil-Filter/dp/B000EQ8XLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Motorcraft FL2017B Oil Filter</a>&nbsp;on my 2006 FORD escape hybrid car is easy for me. Thankfully FORD made the placement of oil filter in this model where one can reach easily to replace. I have been doing this about once a year or when my car tells me to replace the oil (It has a on-board counter of some sort). It also gives me peace of mind that nothing else has been tampered with when I do my job myself and gives me satisfaction of doing the job right in my own garage.Having said, The Filter has new improved design when compared to previous releases.

I love them! took about 2 weeks to arrive but worth the wait. put on my 08 jeep wrangler JK. literally from start to finish took me about 10 mins to install(mostly because the tape was a little difficult to take off the back with short nails). I cleaned edges where tape was to be applied with rubbing alcohol to remove any dirt or oils around the grill and BAM, peel and press. No instructions were included but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out. the 'wider side lip' goes on bottom. glossy black(pics make it look a little silver'ish') no scratches or peeling with any of the pieces. so glad I ordered them!

Very bright. Nice projector. Used as fog lights in 2002 Toyota Tacoma. Rewired running lights and fog lights. 4 stars because they are just marginally brighter than my old fogs which were supposedly 600 lumens. Projector is really nice though. Smaller than I thought and really a nice white color. No blue. EDIT: one failed by the second month being in. Switched back to my superbrightleds.com leds.

Come to find out when I opened the hatch the strut fell out! This could be dangerous when closing since the struts are very strong when closing. The second strut finally broke and almost took my eye out. Please do not buy this MaxxPower struts you will thank me!

Bought a car with tires turning brown, common effect it seems for the Continental DWS Extremes. I wanted something that can restore the black without making it look too glossy. This was it. Gives the new tire look without the overkill shine. This product was easy to apply, to avoid overspray I sprayed it onto a foam applicator and then rubbed it onto the tires. Will update with more pictures to see how long it lasts.8/30/2016 UpdateOkay so since the photos I took these only lasted a 2 weeks.  My tires have since then returned to its original state.  Lowering rating from 5 stars to 3.  I like the effects but it doesn't really get rid of the brown parts of my tires.

A short version of the FL-400S.  A few year ago, the FL-400S was even longer.  Ford made it smaller.  But even that was not short enough.  Along comes this little filter, for smaller cars with less clearance.If you have the clearance for the FL-400S, use it.  You will have more capacity and better filtration with a longer filter.  More filter media.  No-brainer.The Ford Motorcraft line of filters is well constructed.  Search online.  Watch the videos on YouTube.  When these filters are cut open, you will see that the design and construction of these filters is a lot better than at least half of the over-the-counter brands on the market, and rivals that of boutique brands.I have never seen one of these filters fail.  Not once, have I seen a Motorcraft filter blow off under load, even in racing applications with highly modified engines.  I would have every bit of confidence using Motorcraft in any daily driver, commercial vehicle, or fleet vehicle.  And I would not hesitate to install a Ford Motorcraft filter on a Honda motor.

I'm attaching pictures of how these are in my car.  Unless your seats are thin, or your headrests are attached at the front of your seat back, you're going to have the same issue.  They are way off the seat contour.  That makes for very little space to get your fingers in between the seat and hook to get items unhooked.  I had to twist in my seat because it required two hands.  And it will only hold a purse with handles a quarter inch or less in diameter or width.  I forced the handles on this picture and it was quite a chore getting it back off.  I didn't keep the packaging so I can't send it back.  Perhaps someone else can use them.

My 'old car' finally wore through it's original halogen bulbs and it was time to order a replacement. I'm admittedly a bit obsessed with LEDs especially of the cool white - daylight variety. I really want a set of bulbs similar to this in my new car, but decided I wanted my old car to be the test mule first.The package arrived quickly due to the magic of Amazon ordered Thursday evening and it arrived on Saturday. At first I was slightly alarmed it was in a bubble mailer but then saw the very nice box w/ foam inserts. The packaging is A+ stuff for a Chinese made product, and then I observed the bulbs. To my delight they seem to also be of solid quality, but I'm still wary of that little fan blowing...I pulled the old bulb out of the headlamp assembly and plugged this one in with the knotch oriented so the factory 9006 harness pushed over it. Being wise for once I tested the headlight before going any further and it didn't come on. I then noticed the +- listed on the bulb and looked at the wiring on the factory 9006 harness and there was a blue lead going to what would be the + side of this bulb and a red wire going to the - side. I removed the bulb from the headlamp and then the factory harness and measured the voltage coming out of the harness. Well either the factory harness is made backwards or this bulb is because I had to orient the bulb knotch side down and utilized a strong tape to ensure the connection held.Then came the fun part of trying to get the headlamp assembly back in and while it was really close the heatsink on this bulb was just a bit too large. Not being a QUITTER I grabbed a punch and modified the metal hood/radiator frame on the vehicle just enough so that both of the bolts could go in. Waited until nightfall and oriented my two trash cans so I can see the output difference between a severelyl worn OEM bulb and this LED and it is night and day different. The pattern seems like it will work well but I'll update this as some time passes.

I have used these for various interior lights inside of my blue C6 Corvette Z06 and my blue Silverado SS truck.  The 194 is used all over the place in American cars like the front floor wells, map lights, mirror lights, and door panel lights.  Not only do these blue LEDs put out more lumens they do not burn ridiculously hot like the 194 clear incandescent bulbs.  After replacing many bulbs in my truck interior and exterior, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND replacing those hot little 194 bulbs as I found they were actually burning the sockets and wiring in my truck.  Of course, I would not recommend colored LED 194 bulbs on the exterior ot any vehicle, expecially blue, due to law enforcement, but interior switchable on/off lights, ... yes.

Plugs were not the same as oem on the vehicle. New plugs were labeled "B" and the plugs that were on the car were labeled "C". But they had the same part number. I don't understand. Might return or splice the new with the old connector. We shall see

This is a good looking header, mine arrived quickly and everything looked well built with good enough welds.  Test fitting showed it to fit perfectly on the head and match the down pipe perfectly, I was extremely excited.I inserted 2" 3/8-16 SS threaded rod into the cylinder head instead of reusing the factory bolts, as I heard that was a nightmare.  This was the best suggestion I found on a Jeep forum.The manifold did not fit on my 1997 Cherokee Sport.  I had to hammer #5 tube down perhaps 1/4", and I used a flap wheel to take some material off of the manifold.  I finally (2 hrs) got everything to look like it was lined up, and snugged everything down in the order that is recommended in the instructions.  After finishing everything else, I got it started but it has a massive vacuum leak due to the manifold not sitting fully on the cylinder head.  This will cause it to rev upwards of 4k.So now I get to spend another evening tearing it all down, hammering it some more, and hoping that it is enough.  Keeping my fingers crossed.  I have worked on cars for over 10 years and this is perhaps one of the more frustrating things I have ever worked with. I will update after it is running.UPDATE:  The manifold did fit, I had to take my grinder to the intake a second time, and hammer the #2, #5, and #6 tubes slightly to get them to sit flush.  I used someone else's advice, and laid the exhaust manifold flat on the ground, then stood the intake up.  After doing that it was obvious where it needed to be bent/ground.  Lastly, the exhaust flange is too thick for the factory manifold so the washers sit crooked.

ships directly from the radiator company, and it is much lighter than the original radiator, ( btw the old leaking original japanese radiator from my 93 isuzu trooper are worth more than $20 at the metal recycling place, I think the old radiator was copper/aluminum material) and it fits my car just fine, and works like it should, no problems during and after installation.

Basically something that covers your tank while stationary? It states it clearly in the write up, however I'm feeling devilishly brave and plan to tow my RV with it fitted...sssssssshhhhhhhh, don't tell the manufacturer ...cos then they'll invalidate my warranty. Classic piece of 'Cover Your Assery'  from the makers. So fed up

First one did not have bolts to mount. Amazon took care of it immediately. Then I realized after putting things together it does not work with the Allen Sports 542RR. Hitch hole does not line up. Other than that seems very well made

Very happy so far.  1 star knocked off because of the tiny sensor hole, that's a pain.  I bought it knowing I was going to drill it out.  So I did, with a 3/8" NPT tap from McMaster Carr and a 9/16" drill bit from Home Depot.  The sensor I got was from Speedway Motors because it was much cheaper than other sensors I saw.  In a hot pot of water I found the sensor closed around 192 degF.  I sealed it up with some Permatex thread sealant.  Careful not to tap too deep like I did! It should still be okay but the sensor bottoms out on the little screw head before it gets really tight (if it's an issue I can just ground the housing a different way and toss the screw).

Could be better, but they work.Mine actually are LEDs inside the lights - at least the ones I opened. I did have one red one that, when illuminated, was a bright pink color. The switches DO have a good "click" feel to them. Inside them however the pivot plate is kind of thin, and doesn't have a smooth area to rock back and forth in - it will last but with high usage it's lifespan will decrease substantially. They fit very tightly into standard 3/4" keyed holes, and the keyed hole only puts the LED in one direction, which is a problem addressed below.Like the other reviews stated, mine are BACKWARD for when activated. The normal "ON" position for switches i've had in the past is to push the LED side down, turning on the switch, and activating the LED. Please see the photo with the red LED switch (an old one of mine) - it is in the ON position and the LED would be lit if i had it connected. These are just the opposite. To turn the switch "ON" you push the side down WITHOUT the LED on it, activating the LED and letting power flow. Please see the photo with the blue LED (a new one) - it is in the ON position and the LED would be lit had it been connected. If using keyed holes like I am, the LED is upside down - you turn ON the switch and the LED is at the bottom. Changing the position of the wires has not effect - the LED still lights up only in one direction. You could take the switch apart and flip the rocker assembly to have the LED side light up when pressed down. I chose to ignore it, as this application it would not matter and would keep the light from shining directly at me - to some people it would matter what direction the LEDs shine.

I bought this deflector for a '04 F-150 Heritage.  It fits close to the hood but there is enough room to get a hand behind it to wipe away any dirt or leaves.  It feels secure, it does not rattle.  It is held on by the plastic screws or rivets, whatever you call them.  I have only gone through one car wash since I mounted it, there were no problems.  I usually wash the truck myself.  I think it looks good and should last for a long time.My only complaint is with mounting the deflector on the hood.  Maybe the part is made to fit a variety of trucks, it almost fits the Heritage perfectly, almost.  I had to get longer screw/rivets at the autoparts store to fit the mounting holes near the center of the deflector.  I could not compress the deflector enough to make the stock screws work.  I could have trimmed the deflector or used a heatgun to bend it.  I got longer screws and that worked well.  Over all I am happy with my purchase, just had to spend some time to mount it.If it would have been quicker to install it would have been 5 stars.

Perfect fit for my 95 civic Si, D16Z6Rotor looks just like the OEM Honda one that I replaced.I was going to go the Honda route again but decided to give Bosch a try.  My dealer wanted $25+ dollars for the rotor, so this one is a bargain, but still looks much better quality than the normal local part store china junk.Underside of the rotor is stamped, Made in Japan.

OK, I usually hate seeing reviews that say "I haven't used it yet" but that is exactly what I am doing. There is no doubt in my mind that it will not remove grit, grime or other contaminants from my wash mitt and keep it away from my cars finish. So what I am going to tell you is about the dimensions which is what many of the questions I read are about and that I had myself. As you can see from my pictures and the dimensions in the description, the Grit Guard is 10 3/8". The statement is also made that it will fit in any standard 12" 5 gallon bucket. So I went out to Lowes and picked up the standard 5 gallon "blue bucket". I took that bucket over to the tool section and measured the top and bottom inner diameters. The top of the bucket was a little less than 12" and the bottom inner diameter was right at 10". Well I didn't have the greatest expectations with those measurements but I bought the bucket anyway with the thought of just having to return it. Well it turned out it fit perfectly. The lower standoffs slightly taper down right to about 10", this let the Grit Guard sit flush with the bottom of the bucket as designed. I am very happy with how things turned out. So if you are looking at buying this to help with your car washing duties, I say go for it. As for the bucket that you want to put it in, take it over to the tool aisle or bring your own tape measure and take some quick measurements, if the bottom is at least 10" in diameter, you're good. My 5 gallon bucket was purchased at Lowes 2/2016. Good luck everybody, hope this helps.

Worked to perfection on my 1992 Chevy K1500 4WD with the TBI 5.7L 350. Pulled the pulley off with ease and re-installed it with the same amount of ease. My words of advice are to use some PB Blaster, or other break loose liquid, on your pulley prior to trying to pull it and to also use some WD-40(like I did) or old motor oil on the threads of the puller & installer. This tool makes your mechanics life much easier and you can hardly put a price on that.I did NOT use any sort of air tool or impact on this puller, just simple hand tools(wrench & socket). Made in Taiwan but worked great. Check out my pictures for more info.

Unplug it. Get a pair of chanel locks and unscrew this part. Take off the old O ring and throw a little oil on the new one and put the oring in place. Tighten it down,  plug it up... Bam leaks gone. Well worth the money to stop losing expensive refrigerant.

There is absolutely nothing bad to say about this product. Nothing! I does exactly what is says it will, which is provide you with minor paint correction for your vehicle. I have been detailing my cars for over 20 years now (it is indeed my stress relief) and during this time I have used just about everything new that comes out. I was introduced to this product via the BMW forum where people were raving about its quality.I have to be truthful, I had never even heard of HD products before this, sure I had seen them online, but no one I knew had actually used them and the reviews were scarce at that time. I bit the bullet and got the product...  I pulled out my faithful Porter Cable DA polisher with an mid level Orange Adams pad and went to task. WOW!  I was floored by the results after just one pass on my Sapphire Black Metallic Z4M. Minor scratches and some small swirl marks went poof. I was like, hum. So I decided to go for a second round. The results were spectacular and I do mean SPECTACULAR!  Swirl marks had completely vanished and all but the deepest scratches and those horrible rock chips also went away.What I ended up with was an incredibly deep shine that simply blew me away. After reading some more I found that when you partner HD Poxy into the mix you not only make the shine deeper but you add months of protection to it. In the past my favorite go to wax was P21s, and while it added that deep wet shine, the protection didn't last long. The HD combo was just what the doctor ordered as the Michigan Winter starts to kick in.Oh, don't take my word for it, just take a look at this picture of my hood and you tell me. Excellent product, I can not recommend or endorse it enough.

Installed a 50" curved Auxbeam light bar on my 2000 Ford F250 using this wiring harness.  No instructions whatsoever, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.  Plenty of wire length and the provided plug to attach to the light bar is definitely preferable to permanent connection.  Thankfully, the switch comes pre-attached because without instructions or a schematic it would be tough guessing which wire attaches to what terminal.  How big of a hole is recommended to mount the switch?  Good luck guessing the correct size (its 0.760" by the way) and figuring out the size and position of the anti-rotation slot you have to cut for the switch.

Collinite 840 works great but is not recommended for darker colors. I always start off with a clean car, then the clay. Following that preparation the 840 Cleaner was used on my 2011 KIA Sedona silver color and it worked very well. The Collinite 845 Insulator Wax has become my favorite automobile wax. Brilliant depth combined with durability can not be matched, surface remains smooth and water repellent after six months of outdoor parking. I found that the wax application worked easier if it is heated prior to shaking and application. Setting Collinite 845 in hot tap water for a few minuted, shake well and it's ready, you can set it in the warm southern California sun as you prepare the surface and that works as well.

BEWARE Failed Nuts out of the box that can and will cause a car accident*******************BEWARE Failed Nuts out of the box that can and will cause a car accident***************Bought this part this week, installed it at automotive shop(just because i have access to one) using 17mm && 5mm Hex and AllData Torque Specs,. I was happy initially how it felt in my hand at first, left shop, two block down the street noticed clicking coming from driver side first, then as i was coming back to auto shop i noticed passenger side started clocking....Got it on lift again for full suspention examination noticed missing nut from the upper mounting point at sway bar link (driver side), upon checking passenger side i noticed that half loose nut same location upper mounting sway bar link.Out of curiosity i walked a street for two blocks, sure enough found failed nut.Called to Amazon reporting a problem requesting an exchange "OR" for failed part, Amazon rep been rude and on top feeding me lies,... asked for a supervisor been placed on HOLD for next 15minutes and finally been hang-up......Called again requesting supervisor or manager.... got transferred to a "LEADER ???" explained them the situation, was offer refund......Called a Toyota dealer ordered NEW nuts.Just drove 100+ miles drive side failingI will comeback to this review after time pass, too reconfirm the longevity of those parts

This cup holder folds up nicely (although it could look a little more flush folded up, it is good enough).  It is sturdy and has 6 holes to mount it using the screws provided (4 screws provided).  I used all 6 screw holes with my own screws to ensure that it stays put.  It is perfect to hold a drink while laying in bed watching a movie.  It would hold a very large size cup, bigger than Mayor Bloomberg would like us to be drinking.Overall I give this 5 stars because it is not an eyesore and it provides a convenience at a great price.

Installed this gauge cluster in my 2009 WRX hatch. I went with an AEM 30-0300 X-Series wideband and an Autometer 5903 boost gauge.This is where I'll warn people about the gauge cluster. It seems to be made for electronic gauges and not mechanical (this particular Autometer boost gauge is mechanical, this means a pressure/vacuum line runs to the back of the gauge instead of just wires). The gauge pods in the cluster only have so much depth to them so the much deeper mechanical gauge like my Autometer ran into the back of the housing. I cut the studs off the back of the gauges since they're not needed but also had to bend the electrical terminals very far in order for the gauge to slide all the way in.I used a dremel to trim back the side with the wideband as the gauge face itself sat higher than the autometer. I did this just to make them both appear to be level in the cluster.Overall I love the stock look this gives and that's why it was worth the money to me. No A pillar pods or random gauges pods on top of your dash.

One of the best purchases I've made for my Van!I got the 8' x 16' mat for my Syncro Westy with a Fiamma awning. It's the perfect combo. The awning goes right to the edge while the mat extends the entire length of my van.Not only is the quality excellent but it sweeps off easily, doesn't have any weird tarp-like crinkle sounds and it's IMPOSSIBLE to stain. I've spilled beer, wine, candle wax, bbq sauce and let it sit in the mud during a torrential downpour for days and it still looks brand new. Everything wipes off with water (even wine and candle wax). Hose it off, let it dry and fold it up.My only gripe is the folding pattern to put it back in the bag. It requires you to fold it a certain way which is opposite of what my brain is saying. A minor complaint for such a brilliant product.Note: Had to blur out my wife for my own protection.

Bought the Moog one first, but due to a steering gear issue the shop couldn't align & center the steering wheel. So I purchased a new gear and this Arm just in case. When I went to put the gear in I compared the 2 arms and the AC Delco one was more robust, the boot was better and looked heftier! I installed the Delco one and wished I had used more of their Professional stuff instead of Moog!1994 K1500 W/Z71

After my gear shifter got stuck in Parking, I removed my '03 Trailblazer console just to find out that the old bushing was totally pulverized. I was lucky to find these Dorman 14055 bushings, installed the one I needed for the car interior in 15 minutes and now I don't need to worry about getting stuck in a traffic jam (or create one) because of this little piece. Thank you, Dorman. Your products are awesome!

I installed the pump and it appeared to perform well.  When I went to pull the 3/8 hose off (after completely loosening the clamp) to adjust the hose length the brass fitting pulled out to my surprise.  Luckily it did not pop out during operation under pressure.  That would be a fire hazard for sure!

Mounted on a 2008 Tacoma 4dr short bed in less than 30 minutes with help from my younger brother in exchange for some beer and a pack of Magic the Gathering cards. The extra assistance isn't necessary at all, though I opted for it since we're not allowed ANY car maintenance at my apartment complex.I was originally going to purchase some other steps, but decided on these mostly due to price. They're packed really well and came with all the necessary bolts and a single page of mounting instructions. The only thing that I didn't like was that the bolts they came with are silver and not black like the rest of the kit. It causes the steps to look a bit 'off' from an aesthetics point of view. If I could have given this 4.5 stars I would have.I would highly recommend is to not tighten the bolts all the way until you have the bar lined up with all 6 bolts inserted from mount to step. Another thing, and I should have known better, is to place the lock washer against the head of the bolt then the washer sits on top of it. Rookie mistake :) According to the instructions, you're supposed to go back after a week to check and re-tighten the bolts if necessary, but unless you're going to be removing them later (which no one does), I'd recommend just using some&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Loctite-Blue-242-Threadlocker-6-Milliliter-Tube-209728/dp/B000I1RSNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Loctite Blue 242  Threadlocker 6-Milliliter Tube (209728)</a>&nbsp;to keep things in place.Note that the mount points are on the body and not the frame and the holes are already threaded.Edit: I've uploaded the pictures a number of times and they always upload upside down. I've edited them, rotated them, etc, but no change. Sorry if you have to twist your head to get a better look.

I ordered 2 of these in my first order.  One was fine and is performing well.The other had the rectangular mounting bracket assembled incorrectly to the piston.  Assembled correctly it looks like the picture on Amazon, i.e. the piston is centered in the bracket.  The bad one has the bracket reversed.  Requested an exchange, Amazon responded very promptly (thank you Amazon!) but the replacement has the same defect.  The bracket is riveted to the piston so there is no way to correct the condition short of cutting the rivet and replacing it with a bolt.The packaging of the replacement product was previously opened so it is possible it was previously returned for the same defect. Just requested another exchange.Photo 1 shows the good one installed in my car, and a bad one held next to it.Photo 2 shows a defective part by itself for comparison against the photo on Amazon

Don't know how critical it was to replace these but I did anyways since I was replacing the end bushings which were extremely worn. I used NAPA's sil-glyde to lubricate the sway bar hole. Didn't want to use grease aside from the silicone type to lubricate these.Did it on a 07 Ford E350

I haven't had the bulbs for long so I cannot rate the life of them,  but they are super bright and have very good 360 coverage. I bought these to replace my gauge cluster lights and due to all the leds they provide a nice even consistent light. I actually have to keep my dash lights on the lowest dim setting at night because of how bright these are.

I purchased this and it fits both of my hitch vehicles perfectly.  Its a nice design and allows for an easy connection to any mirror.  I've used it on both our 2012 Toyota Rav4 and my 2010 Toyota Tacoma which are vastly different mirror sizes.  The Rav4 is more like a "car" mirror and the Tacoma's is much more bulky.  Had no problem fitting it to either.  I've used it to pull trailers up on the highway and when its tight on your existing mirror, it doesn't shake or rattle at all.  Its a rock. Make sure you buy two, since you only get one in a package.

Perfect! LOVE the spot beam/pencil beam, throws light down the road like crazy. Install was a breeze if you just take you time and lay it all out first. These lights are powerful and durable.I added the stock switch included with the kit and the gauge pod from Rugged Ridge, but then ordered a custom switch from OTRATTW switches. (I ordered the Contura switch and contacted them about a custom etch to show the round KC light on the jeep icon and the words "windshield lights" it was about $22 after shipping).I also used the Smittybuild light bracket because I wanted them to be further outwards and lower than the regular lights you normally you see. The Smittybuilt bracket 7690 is the same style as the Rubicon bracket from jeep but less than half the price. The stock antenna was an issue but the bracket come with a "metal guide" to push the antenna out of the way, but it looks goofy. A great solution is to just take a long deep well socket slide it over the antenna and put some slight bends in the antenna to move it way from the lights...looks very professional and takes 20 minutes.

I've had this RV cover for about 7 months now and decided to write a review to share my experience. Haven't been paticularly impressed with this cover. After 7 months it's full of holes from the wind and any edge of the coach. The straps aren't very good and don't pull it very tight. It's definitely not worth the money. I would choose a different manufacturer/model if I had to do it all over again. I think my next cover will be a covered parking spot! So I'm updating this after having this cover 1 year. The longer I have it the worse I hate it. After one year it is almost completely useless. The material is paper-thin and even pulling on it, it begins to tear. I would honestly save your money and pay for covered storage. This thing is junk. I think I now know why I rarely ever see an RV in outside storage with a cover over it!

The grooves fit the weld lip on my 2018 Subaru Outback touring. Only the back half of it will lift the car because of the Subaru jacking point design. The front or outside of the weld lip  of the jack point slopes up & out toward the car body, the back of the weld lip of the jack point does the work. I had to modify the bottom with a razor knife to fit my floor jack lift pad. I haven't used it yet but it seems thick & hard enough not to collapse under my car's weight.  Review Edit: Finally tried it out & it worked fine. It lifted & held the car up with no damage to the weld lip or this jack pad. edited some photos

Used this for my electric fan conversion on the 2004 astro van. The fan utilized is a high amperage fan from a Crown Victoria police interceptor. The fan is 19 inches tall and pulls serious amperage. When running, the van voltage drops from 13.5 to 12.4. It's no slouchy fan. Prior to using the pac isolator, there was a typical 30 amp box relay (KC lights branded). After a month, the relay started to stick open and cause the fan to run the battery down. This was due to the relay housing deforming over time.Is this isolator overkill? Perhaps. Perhaps not. I bet the titanic wish it was it overkill.Here is a video of it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KaE8GWNYbs

So far so good I installed these a daytime running lights on my 370Z after replacing 4 other types including phillips where a LED would burn out. So the housing looks solid the luminescence is bright white, good visibility, and the install is pretty easy. A little bit of craftsmanship like anything for aftermarket, non-custom OE install. They look great!

The light output is fantastic.  Hasn't rained here in a month, so I don't know if it is going to collect moisture or not.  Great light, I would buy it again.  My only complaint is the lack of info about the light.  There was no paper work or documents, which wasn't a big deal except for the fact that you don't have any data about power usage.

I was a little skeptical at first when I saw the bezel. It looked a little too big, but, when I went to install it, it fit like a glove. I think it looks even better than the original. This was a perfect fit for my 2000 GMC Sierra 1500 Ext Cab, 4WD. Thanks for another great purchase Amazon. I definitely recommend this to others.

I currently own the SC400D (Driver's Side) case so I purchased the passenger side.  When it arrived, something wasn't right with the clasp bracket so i contacted swingcase directly and they shipped me out the correct extension mounting bar free of charge.  This is a great american company that stands behind it's product.  My only negative about this product is that you must remove the corner tie-down to install the swingcase.

Definitely a must if you change wheels and tires bigger than stock. Mine only had performance tune as high as 92 but that's only because I live in the PNW. But it's well worth it. Crisp shifts.  More power. Most power is on low to mid range but noticeable either way!

I bought these on a lightning deal with no specific use in mind, I then needed to get a couple very faded sea doo personal watercraft ready for sale and thought "what the heck" I'll try this stuff.  WOW, just wow, I have used 3m professional gelcoat products forever and these smoke those in ease of use.  The best part was how well the first round came out.  After the heaviest compound the work was largely done with very little compound haze like you will have with other abrasive compounds but each level had incremental improvement.  I went from chalky pink to bright red in no time.  I know that this is not advertised as a marine product but I am sold!  The attached after pic was after just the V32.  I used a 6in Porter Cable DA buffer with appropriate pads which obviously helps

Update:After using this cover for several month the aluminum panels kind of sank into the frame and it made the cover look uneven.  It's hard to explain but of the three panels, the front and the rear sat lower than the middle panel. ___-----___.  This made the fabric very loose and would even pool up water.  I ended up throwing some foam under the cross beams to try and lift the pales back up to the proper level but then I said f-it.  I'm sending this crap back.  Luckily Amazon is such an awesome company.  I ended up buy an Extang Solid Fold 2.0 and absolutely love it.  Way better than this piece.  Yeah it's more money but well worth it.I love this cover. It fits great and was 1/3 of the cost versus buying from the dealer. I tried to show how well it fits in the photos.

This fuse fits Painless Performance Alternator Wiring Kits 30700.  There doesn't seem to be any information about replacement fuses when you order the kit.  If you are looking for replacement fuses, these are AMI (Cooper Bussmann) or MIDI (Littelfuse) type and measure 1-3/16" between hole centers.  Wish the information for wiring kit had stated this.  I've posted a photo of the fuses.

I purchased these lights for a piece of excavation equipment. Previously, I had purchased Genssi 27w led flood lights for another piece of equipment.  Thinking these were 72 watt, I jumped at the opportunity.  However,  side by side,  the 27w Genssi is heavier, has better leds, better lens, is brighter and distributes the light much more evenly. I don't even know if I'll bother installing these lights. They might be okay for a smaller project in the future. I am also skeptical as to actual current draw. The wires are very small for 6 amps at 12v. The Genssi lights used a larger wire size for 35% of the current claimed by this light. EDIT: I did a current draw test.  The result... 15 watts, not 72 watts.UPDATE: SELLER IS TRYING TO BUY GOOD REVIEWS. Upon leaving this review, I received an email containing the following:Message from 3rd party seller:Dear XXXXXXWe are very sorry that the true power is less than what the manufacturer describe.This light bar is offered by manufacturer  , we are still investigating the cause of this problem.We apologize for this problem , and we would like to offer $12 refund.Is it possible to deleted the review ?Looking forward to your reply .

I'm so happy with this purchase. Although I didn't buy it on amazon, I picked it up at a local bike shop, I still wanted to leave a review. As a first time bike rack buyer, it was incredibly difficult choosing the right rack, especially because of the negative reviews. It really makes you doubt. But let me tell you, this bike rack is awesome. It is very secure, it doesn't scratch the car, and it fits 3 bikes (2 adults and 1 child bike). Some negative reviews say there is no way you can fit a child bike on it, but that's just them, not being smart enough, because you can.Take a look at photos attached.

Ive been a technician for 7 years and a mobile mechanic for 1 year running it myself. I like to test things and now I have something else I want to test out. Ive a borescope and I took pictures of the carbon build up on the pistons. Its a 2005 Chevy Trailblazer 4.2L in-line 6. I bought 2 bottles and once I put one in I will check it again and report if any changes. Then I will do the next bottle and report any changes. I want to know and Im sure others will be curious of this as well. Right now here is what it looks like before I add the additive. In order with a reference I uploaded this is pistons 6,4,3, & 1 Im going to focus on since pistons 5,6 are clean.3/14/18I came back to edit the pictures numbering the pistons so its easier for others to look at.

I was so excited when this arrived and couldn't wait to put it on my Jeep. At first glance, the stickers are in fact very detailed. Because they were so small (the letters are only about 3/4" tall, I opted to put this on my laptop and get a different sticker for my vehicle. Great choice! I ended up cutting the sticker sheet in half so I could center the helmet (yes, I am a bit OCD). Upon measuring everything to make it perfectly centered, I decided to go ahead and remove the backing. I firmly pressed the sticker against the computer and rubbed it gently, but firmly, to ensure solid contact with the surface. I then carefully began to remove the clear backing, leaving the die-cut letters in their perfectly selected location. What a nightmare this turned out to be!!! The adhesive on the backing was so strong, I had to use an exacto knife to peel the letters and then slowly work it back into the correct alignment. The vinyl was very thin, and I think it is only a matter of time before a letter comes off and then I will just pull them all off and pitch the idea. BTW, the free sticker advertised won't even cover a quarter!I ended up with a different sticker for my Jeep and it was much easier to install to my OCD specifications. ASIN B007Z8VG30. If you want a good sticker for your car, this probably shouldn't be your first choice. I hope this helps!

So far I am really satisfied with this headlight! I did a front end conversion on my Suzuki SV1000s to a naked and it fit the bill perfectly... actually I did the conversion a while back and bought me of the first LED headlights available.. Needless to say that light was absolutely terrible and could barely see 3 feet in front of me on a dimly lit road. For me, this was an absolute must and a great quality light considering the price!I am by no means handy when it comes to many things but after taking some time to read over the wiring schematics for my bike, I got it installed in around 3 hours... thats 3 hours with a few breaks, installing a new headlight housing, and cleaning up the existing wires.The light comes with a standard Harley Davidson harness plug and my bike obviously did not. I purchased a plug to adapt to the headlight and it worked perfectly.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018HSCD1K/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_g6tKBb874WHTJHeadlight build quality seems like its well made and the lens is described as durable and scratch resistant. Time will tell.I spent several days researching all types of led lights at different prices and this was the best one I could find. If you're on the fence, this is the right choice.

Quick delivery, always a plus from Amazon!I changed the interior colors on my Jeep from Tan to gray/black and I didn't want to spend the $$$ on new seats so after going thru half a dozen junk seat covers I finally went ahead and ordered neoprenes. They fit tight with every contour of the seat and the best part is that they cover every inch of the seat.. not just half way down the back like most covers. You wouldn't know that my seats are a different color underneath at all! They do not wrinkle, they don't pull and slide with my big butt when I get in and out, the straps are firm and sturdy. I have gotten many compliment on them.. ppl actually think they are seats without covers.Best price I found for neoprenes right here on Amazon! FIVE STARS!!

I was skeptical to buy one for a long time. But After a few days, I am pretty happy! Speedometer is finally working again! I am running 35s with a 3inch lift, and it corrected it perfectly, verified with 3 separate GPS trackers. I also installed an AirRaid CAI 4 weeks before the SuperChip, I did this to see if there was any noticeable difference from the CAI and the SC. The CAI gave marginal throttle response, but nothing like the SuperChip. There was no MPG again from the CAI.Updated with my MacBook Pro in about 5 minutes. I copied the wranglers engine profile within about 10 minutes, and had all the programming done in about another 10. It is super easy.Throttle response - I have small but noticeable gains in performance, however the throttle response with the Superchips throttle profile has helped my JK not seem like a tank off the start. With the steel bumpers, winch, and 5 - 35s it is pretty heavy. There is no more lag when accelerating. Where it would generally lul for a second after pressing hard on the skinny, it now just takes off! I can also just gently press the pedal rather than smashing the damn thing down. No more mashing!91 Tune- I chose to run the 91 performance tune because I ran 91 anyway. Living at altitude there is 86, and no 87. I have noticed the engine runs better with the 91 than the 86 here. I know I can run it, but the JK runs better on the higher octane. Overall driving around town, as well as the highway is more enjoyable. There is less gear searching on the highway, and I can also maintain higher speeds without having to keep the Jeep at 3k rpm. I can now maintain 75mph sitting around 2K rpm, which would not have been possible before. As previously stated, I can press the pedal and get where I am going without mashing the skinny. Before the install, as everyone else knows, I would have been pressing the pedal through the floor to get this thing to move. Now I can press it half way and off I go! I have not tried the Mileage Saver, 93 octane tune, 87 tune, crawl or tow tunes.MPG - Gas mileage was something I had hoped would improve. I drove the Jeep on a highway trip to try and get a full tank through, as well as see the improvement. To my surprise it was actually getting better mileage. 2 mpg more! Done by math, not the onboard computer! I am getting a little over 300 Miles per tank!!Overall I am happy with the purchase. It was hard to justify the price, but after seeing the results, it is worth it. Its not an Audi, but it is much more enjoyable to drive, and the mpg is definitely welcomed! Just buy it!!January 28th - Absolutely loving this thing. It drives so much calmer now, no more constant gear searching and RPM jumping. Highway driving is much easier because of this, which has been greatly adding to my MPG. I calculated 17, and the Wrangler got 17.2. Either way, great improvement from not being able to get over 13 mpg regardless of what I did. With 35s and a 3 lift, I am very happy with it, only regret is not buying this sooner!This item was purchased by me without compensation or benefit from the company in exchange for my review!

installed on a 7x14 toyhauler - cargo trailer (somewhat tall in height) and because it's fully adjustable it fits really well. It's slightly over-sized  for my size of trailer but I'm happy that I can also wrap around the tongue and tires as well. To be honest I was worried if it would fit or work out because it labeled as a 'travel trailer' version but the header indicated 'toyhauler' and was very pleased do discover that it had zippers (and access) to the rear and front side of the cover. It's great to know that I can drop the rear door without having to remove the cover! It was well packaged and also comes with a nice bag for storage. Time will tell how durable it is and how long it will last exposed to constant to California sunshine!

Its great for the price but it did have some issues with the install hardware.  1) The bolts that hold the Swivel Plate to the Mounting Plate were too short.  They did not engage the locking part of the lock nuts.  2) The one of the holes in the Support Bracket was too small for the Carriage Bolts to seat.  I called customer service and got hold of them without much trouble.  They were very polite and sent out a new hardware kit.  The new kit arrived quickly but unfortunately had the same problems.  So I had to buy a couple of bolts and file the hole in the Support Bracket hole for about 30 seconds.  Even considering the problems with the hardware, I would buy this again.  Its well made and is easy to use.  The rifle slides in easily and is well protected.  The inner sock was a little tricky to install.  I lined up the sock where I wanted it and then peeled the backing strip away from the Velcro while holding it in place.  It was a little tricky to do but the sock lined up nicely.  I did have the problem with the Turn Knobs backing off and the boot did bounce around a lot, but were on some very rough roads.  It was nothing that some lock washer and bungee cords couldn't handle.  As far as protecting the rifle goes it performs well.  While out on a very rough road I flipped the quad on its side.  When we pushed the quad back up on its wheels and assessed the damage.  The front fender was displaced enough to notice, and the Swivel Plate on the gun boot was bent.  The Boot itself was fine aside from some very minor scratches and the rifle inside was perfect.  We tried to pull the bracket out by hand and couldn't do it.  Its a pretty stiff piece of metal.  If I had to setup another quad I would definitely but another one of these.  There might be better out there but for the money this is great.

Installed one of these in the license plate light on my 2008 Suzuki V-Strom. Fit was good and tight.  I was worried that the polarity may be such that the LED  chip would have to be flipped over to illuminate, but then it would be aiming up instead of down at the license plate.  It appears that the chips have dual contacts on each side of the silicon and diodes, so that they may be mounted in either direction and still work with 12vdc.  Time will tell how they stand up.  The minimum I could find for T10 single sided LEDs was this set of 4. I only needed 1 so I'll be giving away a few to my friends with the same bikes.  Time will tell how well it holds up, as the license plate light on this bike is on whenever the ignition switch is on - there is no way to turn it off.

I bought this Steering Wheel Lock because after 5 years of use my older Club 1000 doesn't work anymore and I expect that the newer model have to be better than the older one because the price is around $20,- higher than my Club 1000 (my fault).I don't now what the manufacture is doing wrong, but the red coating is sticky like glue!Even after cleaning the Lock with gentle soap and glass cleaner, the coating is still sticky.Shame on me I cut the packaging in half and put it in the trash container before I checked the steering wheel lock, so I cant send it back.So I removed the sticky stuff wit a knife and use ist without the protection coating, maybe I will buy shrink tubing for the shafts of the Lock to protect my steering wheel.Don't by this product!!!

1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport 4.0L......Replaced my oem springs and 3"  add a leaf lift from Rough Country, with these.  At best the add a leaf had given me 1 to 1.5 inches of lift.  These are definitely 3.5 inches.  Maybe and I mean maaaaaybe, I lost a 1/2 inch when  settled.  I even had to remove my 2 inch rear shackels and go back to the oem's. These are Very Good Springs.  Customer service from Bearcat Goods was outstanding!  The only fitment issue that I came across was that the Centering Pin on the springs is larger than the Factory hole on my axle.  I had to Auger out the centering hole a bit to get them to seat.  Keep in mind---- If you go any taller than this on your lift you will need to at least replace the Rubber center brake hose to a longer one.  Running 31x10.5x15 tires, I have 7" top of tire to bottom of fender clearance, and 24" Ground to Rocker panel Clearance.

I really dislike purchasing foreign made flags or patriotic memorabilia, so I was really glad that the seller (ePartStore) confirmed that this trailer hitch cover is MADE IN THE USA!I purchased the Red/Silver/Blue version and it looks very sharp on my black SUV. The aluminum emblem is chrome finished with an enamel fill for the colors and is mounted on an all metal powder coated mount. The mount is 1/16 inch thick, weighs about a pound and is very sturdy. The mount has three fitting options for a 5/8 receiver pin at 1.5", 2" and 2.5" from the back of the metal plate. A foam gasket is included to reduce rattling.I thought this emblem, with a 3 height x 3.5 width, would be small, but the striking colors make it conspicuous while the size keeps it subtle. To ensure that this emblem stays on your truck, I would advise getting a keyed receiver lock. This&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Connor-Towing-1615280-NEW-Stainless-Steel-5-8-34-Receiver-Lock-for-Class-I-II-III-IV/dp/B0141HZ62O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Connor Towing 1615280- NEW Stainless Steel 5/8" Receiver Lock for Class I, II, III, IV</a>&nbsp;was a little more than the others but has great reviews - especially against the lock rusting.I had a small cosmetic issue with the emblem which the seller (ePartStore) resolved immediately.

Purchased the 30amp model ( only has 825 Joule Rating ) for a 29 foot travel trailer February 2016. Face of unit has instructions for the possible light ( green, blue, red ) combinations and a operating guide for when the unit instructions fade. Surge protector has a limited lifetime warranty ( does not cover weather shield ) which is only good as the Company backing the product, and can only be tested after the unit has a problem.This unit has a security tab of soft metal to secure with lock and chain, but I think it could be quickly defeated with a good lineman's pliers. Hardened steel would have been better. I used a 7' Kryptonite double loop cable and a Master lock to secure the unit against the fast grab thief, but this would not stop someone with bolt cutters.A flip open weather shield is attached to the unit with 4 screws, a rubber gasket forms a seal between the unit and the weather shield. There is no gasket for the flip open shield and this might be a problem with rain or snow. It does have some rubber fingers on the bottom of the shield ( cord entry point ) called a splash guard to prevent rain from hitting the ground and splashing up into the unit.Surge protector is 14.5" in length, 5" in width, and 5" in depth with the weather shield attached. The unit size fills the power pedestal  and this prevents the door from properly closing. This allows sun, rain and snow to have direct contact with unit. The RV Park Manager said that I could cover it with a garbage bag, but I decided to protect the unit with a 12.00 Lowe's garbage can since the park needs to read and bill for power use. I can only hope that other Managers are so easy going.This unit was shipped directly from the Company by FedEx in it's product box. A plain box would have been better to prevent theft if FedEx leaves your package unattended at your RV or home.Product seems to be well built and hope to use it for a long period ( full time RV ) of time without any problems.

Installation was simple and straight forward.  I would suggest when removing the horizontal bolt, to not fully remove it but remove it enough to where you can finish it with a magnetic tool grabber.  You don't want that bolt falling.  The quality seems durable and I have had no issues in the month they have been installed.  I get a lot of appreciation from passengers that use the handle as the Jeep normally sits high.  I paired these grab bars with side steps I installed which makes getting in easy for my fridnds like Jane who are 5ft. tall.  I feel the straps that are included with Jeeps don't look appropriate as they just dangle while wrapped around the cross bars.  These grab handles fit nicely and look as though they belong in a Jeep.  I would recommend this product.  I have a '16 JKU 75th.

This is the first time using Wagner on my ram 2500 I've always used hawk but this time my local shop installed them and I regret it every day. The first day the started making noise and I thoughtthat since the rotor were cut maybe the noise will go away after a few days but nothing has changed after many days. Iwill replace them as soon as I get thetime. I will not recommend these pads based on my personal experience. The noise is annoying and very laud.Review : disregard my previous review it was the dust shield making contact with the rotor what created the noise.now is a 5 stars

The quality of these decals is pretty good and they feel like theyll last a long time. They are basically as thick as the stock decals and the adhesive is as good as it comes. I didn't even need to use a heat gun and I had no issues applying both decals. I also have NO bubbles. Id highly recommend these decals to anyone.

This was a great choice for my needs, the LEDs fire backward into the reflector, letting the tail light design function the way it was designed to. In my Forester I have the Philips LED 921 bulb which also fires back into the reflector, but Philips does not make a 7440 reverse bulb.Many LED backup bulbs only have chips going around the base and on the tip, others have improved by putting a projector lens on the tip, a big improvement and clever too. I am very glad I found these, aesthetically they look great in the reflector and they are very bright and shine for quite a distance. Overall, I would recommend these.

2011 Silverado 4.8: Installed - 2/7/2018. I purchased the original "Cold Air Kit" in mid 2011. I've cleaned it every 5 thousand miles with the K&N cleaning kit. This last time, I noticed that the cotton on the outside edges of the webbing has worn through. I was a bit hesitant to order the replacement due to not knowing the actual part number. Looking up K&N, I found a measurement guide on the page told me which is the correct one. In doing my research, I read the reviews on this item and saw so many complaints about this item not fitting their specific vehicle. My interpretation of the statement " Universal fit" refers specifically to, "this item will clamp on any ROUND 6" TUBE." Keeping this in mind, it was an absolute perfect fit for my applicationI'm not sure what caused the cotton to "go away" from the webbing. Probably my fault for using pressure to assist in the cleaning instead of just rinsing it. In any case, the original lasted 7 years. I have attached pictures of the before and after

I'm hesitate to write this review bcuz I font want everyone knowing how great this product is. It is like my secret weapon. When paired with a cutting pad, it is an excellent 1-step polish/wax that will give above average results sure to please 99.9% of all customers and users. Photo posted is not fake or edited. Just meguiars cutting disc on rupes 21. One step and done.

My ATV is a Kawasaki Prairie 2002. I bought the Can-Am 709400406 ATV Left Mirror and it fit perfect into the 3/8" factory threaded hole. So, the description was exactly the same for this one. A 3/8" threaded stem. Only once I received this mirror, it in fact was a smaller stem size with a mounting bracket instead. It still looks like a good product. But this wasn't what I wanted or ordered. I would've rated this a 5 star if it wasn't for the fact that I will now have to return this product since the description AND the picture is wrong. If the picture and description is ever updated, I will edit my review. Until then, it stays a 2.I will say that the Amazon return is pretty nice. I don't have to pay for the return shipping and UPS will pick it up at my home. So I did bump my rating to a 3 star.I just found Can-Am 709400523 ATV Mirror and I'm hoping that this is the correct one. It has the same description as this one, but the picture is of the actual mirror and it looks correct. So, I'm going to try a second time.

I purchased this tool to remove the wheel bearings in my front wheel drive car.  The bolt head snapped off the first tool and I immediately contacted ABN who shipped me another one.Edit:  The second bolt snapped in the very same way while I was extracting the bearing from the front of my 05 Ford Escape.  I immediately contacted them about it and got no response.  I included pictures of my dilemma but they don't seem to be interested.  The bolt material is too soft and needs to be upgraded.  I am returning this toolset to amazon for a refund.

As others have stated, they are a little small, but not as thin as you would be lead to believe.I did have to drill new mounting holes and change out the bulbs.  I personally think they are worth the few dollars that I spent on them.A little weather stripping was added to help with both the loose doors and to help with the water resistance.All in all, I am happy with them and would probably buy again.Remember, you are spending 70.00, not 700.00.I have added a couple of pics so you can see them installed on a Honda Aero 750

No issues or complaints concerning the quality. They are a royal b**** to install, if you're not used to it. Drilling the holes and making sure everything is perfectly lined up, is pretty frustrating, but that was made clear in the description, so it's not worth lowering my rating over it. Overall, they look great and hold up good on my 2007 VTX 1300R.

Picked up my new (to me) Weekend Warrior 5th wheel from the dealership, all was well. I've always had a bumper pull so I don't know much about 5ers. Took it to storage to drop it off and it would no longer lift the landing gear to get the trailer off my truck, it only made a terrible grinding noise. Tried to manually lift it with the handle, no go. When i started investigating, I found the landing gear gearbox was split in two. Called the dealership, they said bring it on back we'll put a new (plastic) one in. Dealership was about 30 miles away. I hopped on trusty Amazon and found this beast for only $40. LESS than the original plastic piece of crap. Why in God's name didn't the mfr's use this in the first place! Mind boggling.Anyway, had to tow the trailer to a friends house and park it connected to the truck, too big for my neighborhood. I tried to fig a fix by using a bolt and nut to keep the gearbox in place and only made matters worse (see pic). I received this in 2 days and installed it yesterday. Took about an hour. I did have to sand down the shaft to get off the old one as there were some small burrs that it was hung up on. 2 bolts to remove the motor, and 2 other screws and it was off. I did need to use a hammer to remove the old one also. I was quoted at least $250 in labor+trip charge, plus the cost of the part for a mobile guy to come out and swap it. Glad I did it myself!Lots of Youtube videos showing how to do this yourself with very simple tools. Gearbox works like a champ and I imagine will last a lot longer than the plastic ones. Highly recommend!

Wow i was wondering if this was the correct way to go to leveling my 2015 RAM 1500 crew cab 5.7 2wd. After installing them on, my truck got leveled even at ~38.25in all the way around. Plus it improved handling like a billion %. It took 3 hrs to do both sides. Make sure to rent a coil/spring compressor.

18 months and 23,000 miles in the inner pads on both sides are totally gone. The brake calipers are still sliding freely but the inner pads are completely worn out. The outer pads are only about half gone.The brakes were always a little more noisy than others that I have had.

Wow, that's literally all the comes to mind.  I was a bit worried at first, due to the low price, but these arrived today and I was very impressed with the quailty.  They look questionably flimsy in the pictures, but they are not, they are heavy duty.  I've seen complaints about the zirks but I'm assuming that's an install issue.  The zirks aren't as heavy as some you pick up at an industrial store, but for the price, I literally have zero complaints.  One more notable mention is the finish of these it's is very good, I'm assuming the packaging had something to do with it, each piece is individually bubble wrapped.  For the price (or double, or triple), these are much better quality than any other shackles or lift products I have ever purchased from any manufacturer, hands down.Just for reference, My jeep is not a mall crawler, I'm on 37" BFG's beadlocks with a 4" lift and hiline fenders, and I regularly abuse it.  I needed the extra 3/4 of an inch to help a rubbing issue that was occurring.  Here is a pic of my jeep (pre shackles).

I bought my LEDs a year ago and they're still going strong. Far superior reliability when compared to HIDs. Light output is not comparable, I'd say these LEDs are slightly below halogen brightness. However they have a fantastic look and the interchangeable colored tubes are great.

So I've heard about the whole clay bar process, but never really tried it. Well yesterday I tried to use Duplicolor custom wrap (knock off plastidip) to black out the emblems on my Mazdaspeed 3. That product made a mess of my paint. Overspray ended up all over the rear hatch even though I masked the emblems. Microfiber wouldn't remove it (as duplicolor claims) so I ran into a local store and bought this kit. Wow. It did take multiple passes and one entire bar, but it took every bit of that overspray off and left a smooth shiny finish. I will say the detailing spray does have an odd minty smell, but it works well. Plan on picking up another couple bars and claying my entire car. Very happy with this product.

Used two rolls of DEI black pipe wrap on my stock honda shadow exhaust. I wanted a stock but not look and it turned out pretty good. I did not have the proper tool to get the included locking ties tight, so I just used some hose clamps. The first pipe I had to wrap twice, but once you get the hand of manipulating this stuff it goes on pretty quick. I would definitely use this stuff again.

Do you have a car with a capless gas tank?  This little funnel is perfect for tucking away in your glove box or other out of the way area in your car.  It measures about 7 inches in length (see photo) and you simply insert into the capless gas tank.  I use it to pour fuel additives however, it can be used to fill your tank with a portable gas can.

The images online look really good, but, do these no justice whatsoever. I was apprehensive initially (as you should be with any aftermarket mod/purchase) but all of that is out the window now. First, the packaging is nothing short of a Fort Knox transport. You'd have to hit it with a car to damage the tail lights inside. They're protected by liquid mold foam that solidifies to hold its form inside of individual boxes that are paired inside another box. THAT box is then placed inside a larger Amazon box with air wrap and paper inside.Wow. Thank you for being so dedicated to protecting my investment.As for the install? Piece of cake. If you've ever changed a blown rear bulb then you already know the process. If you haven't, your driver's manual has instructions or just go to Youtube. It literally took me 10 minutes or less and I was home free. It's a complete plug and play. No new pieces or add ons are needed as with some other LED upgrades.The look? My Magnum went from very nice to flat out sinister (which is my goal). The LED upgrade is terrific and I'm upset that I didn't do this sooner. The lights are uber-bright and there are also LEDs on the sides of each lamp which I wasn't expecting so it was a VERY nice surprise. The quality of the lamps are stellar and may even trump OEM build. Solid and just weighty enough to let you know they aren't cheap pieces of crap glued together.Lastly, going from incandescent to LEDs, I immediately noticed how "fast" the bulbs respond to the brake being pressed. It's almost telepathic. If you even think about pressing the brakes these things like up the night behind you. Even the most distracted driver gets a face full of "WHOA BUDDY!!" and literally is not a miniscule second of delay once the pedal is pressed.I don't write reviews unless I'm floored. And I am right now. Do yourself and your Magnum a favor and get these. Spyder has really outdone themselves here. Salute.

Works great on my 2003 Mustang GT, had a x2 before this, hell of an upgrade...I recommend this to everyone, you can forget gaining gas mileage, and on kill mode you'll loose mpg..On 91 tune as daily, and kill mode is a 104 octane tune, couldn't ask for easier/better programmerTechnical Support is a joke, once the tuner goes out (the battery goes bad etc...) it'll be $100 to send it in and get it fixed, which is ridiculous, don't set the tuner on you're dash in the sun or in 1-2 years youll be buying a tuner, also if you duno where to hook this tuner into, then you have zero business buying a tuner if you are "car stupid" just straight up, i see alot of people complaining "it won't recognize my car" etc...yes it will, and you cannot be just you're average moron or you will not figure anything out and will probably end up messing something up on you're car, if you're car dum then just take it to a shop and have them order/tune the car or truck for you.

This kit worked well for me. I was surprised when I took out one of the coils and tried to thread the M10 bolt into it and it seemed WAY TOO BIG! I saw another review on here where someone said they sent the wrong size, but if you just read the instructions, you have to insert it into the blue piece first. It actually compacts it before you thread it in. I would recommend this product for the price and also for the quality. Remember to use a little locktite before you put the coil in so it doesn't come out later. Used on a 1999 Ducati Monster Engine Cover.

UPDATE (2 years later):I live in Wisconsin, and the strap made it through two summers and about 1.5 winters. Considering that the OEM strap lasted through eight years of the same, I consider the durability of this product to be inadequate.(SEE PHOTO)If you live in a warm, dry climate or are holding up a cheap aftermarket muffler, you might do fine with this product. Otherwise I would consider going with a GM strap at around twice the cost. It's well worth the money.I recently purchased a second one only because that's all that was available at my local auto parts store and I don't want my original muffler (which is still in excellent condition) to be lost for lack of a strap.As a side note, the bolt included with my recent purchase was threaded only along about 1/3 of its length, as you can see in the current product image. This was far too little to securely attach the strap to the muffler of my '05 Cavalier. I ended up using my old bolt, which was threaded along its entire length and in remarkably good condition.ORIGINAL REVIEW (previously 5 stars):Didn't appear to be quite as thick steel as the original part, nor probably as good of steel, but far from flimsy.The clamp at the top was welded on slightly crooked, but not enough to cause any problems with installation.Very solid for an inexpensive replacement part, and easy to do the repair myself.  Probably could have done it without a jack.

These fender flares arrived well packaged with good instructions. The weather stripping is a little tedious, but not too bad. Would be nice if they shipped with the rivet screws and weather stripping in place. They look good, they do have a little gapping in some areas, but nothing too bad... unless you are right next to it looking for it, you wouldn't know. Overall satisfied.

This is a good product, very very easy to use, especially if you want a protective clear bra but you aren't able to do the clear film yourself, or cant afford for a professional to do it.  I used this as a temporary solution, I used this while I ordered the film, and then waited until I had time to install it.  This came off very easy like it promises and you can really test it once its removed, its very stretchy, and protective just like the clear bra film!  I was more impressed with it once I removed it and could kind of test it that way.The only negative thing about it was that it seemed to not get clean when you washed it, it would kind of hold a little of the dirt behind but thats the only negative.

This litter bag is made of ballistic nylon and has Velcro patches to keep the top cover latched and also to help keep it in position on a carpeted car floor.Straight out of the box It stood up and did not fold in on itself, nor did it fall over. Adding the weighted 'bean bag' into the zippered pouch on the underside makes it feel very substantial.I placed it on the floor of my 2014 Ford Fusion and it is a perfect fit. I am quite pleased with it. I do not generate a lot of trash in my cars, usually just used Kleenex and maybe a wrapper or two from something small. And the occasional soda pop can. So this XL size is far more than I will most likely ever have a need for.

This light set from Lemonbest is way nicer than I thought it was going to be. So nice that I'm not going to use them for what I originally purchased them for. I had planned on using them at my work. I made a display box to put candy in for our concessions room. I wired in some twelve volt blue LEDs. The don't flash or anything. So I purchased this set. This set is really nice and well put together. The lights are completely in cased. Each light strip has five feet of wire attached to it and a disconcerting plug on the end. You can use all four lights or less if you want. With five feet of wire you have many options for placement. The back o the light strips have 3m tape for mounting. The ac plug on the end has extra wire so you can hide most of it if you use it to power up the lights. I will probably cut it off and wire it to my fuse box myself. The other cool thing is the lights work with music. I didn't receive any instructions so I had to figure everything out on how they work. I normally would have deducted a star for that reason but I like them so much I didn't. So you have four music modes, color changing modes, and color fading modes. Pretty cool. You have to have a 12 volt power supply to operate which is perfect for your car. If you want to use them in your home you can buy a 110 to 12 plug almost anywhere online for not a lot of money. The supplied remote is handy for changing modes and even comes with a battery pre installed. So stick the lights where you want them, plug into a auxiliary plug and your off. I did purchase this product at a reduced price in return for a honest and unbiased revue. I hope I've helped you out.

I'm a huge Rigid fan and have about $5,000 worth of their lights on my truck. Decided to try these out since they were cheap and if they didn't work well, I wouldn't be out much. I hare a fab Fours roof rack and these fit perfectly in the factory holes on both sides. I used the rigid angle mounts. They are pretty bright but not near as much as Rigid. I will likely end up getting the Rigids instead but these are halfway surprising.

Well I just finished this project tonight. I thought it would take much less time than it did. Getting to the dash in my 98 TJ was not a problem at all. The led plugs that came with this did not work well. I ended just using all my factory ones. It took much longer than I expected as it not only matters which side you put the bulb in but also which side of the plugs into the dash. I was tempted to stop because I really didn't think I was going to get them all working. Finally did and it significant improvement to factory. Not sure how long they will hold up without popping out but time will tell.

Updated my cloudy high-beams with these because they advertised an additional 60% throw/distance than stock lights, which I felt was important since my low-beams are aftermarket LED which are known to not throw as far as Halogens. So far so good, but they're definitely in the 3400k range - significantly more yellow than my 6000k LEDs. Not really a criticism since yellow light is supposed to be easier on your eyes and high beans are generally used on dark challenging roads. I took them for a spin around the block but no maintain driving yet. Photo shows the colour compared to my LEDs and highbeams with lowbeams compared to lowbeams only.

Well so far I have had not one problem with these tires but only have about a month (( 8-17-17)) with 300 miles on them (farm truck)... They were exactly as described and look good on my 88 f-150 4x4.. Have not yet got them off road for a real test of traction in mud and it will be a while until it snows ,just around the farm  but I do believe they will do the job being they have a lot of depth in the tread....Mounted and balanced good, rolls true round on the highway but they are stiff and quite firm riding. But I am ok with this..I ordered 4 and got them right at 2 weeks...no problems there..But they were delivered in a big ABF semi and trailer and no way to fit in my drive but the driver had a good dolly and took them right up to my truck AND tossed then in the bed..I don't know if I can do another post after this one but if they give me none or any problems I will try to post it..

Disappointed! After installing and sitting on it, I realized the bottom pan with the caster wheels was pretty scratched up, as if it was used or damaged during shipping. It's scratched down to the bare metal - around the edge and in the middle spindle area (see photos - the flash washes out the damage a lot).I'm giving it some stars because it rolls as designed on hardwood floor and the seat actuates up and down well enough. In terms of functionality, it does what it's supposed to. My big gripe is with quality control. I decided to give this Wen mechanic stool a shot because I was happy with their rotary tool. This seat is a huge let down.I strongly suggest looking over the individual pieces before you put this together in case you received a damaged product.

For their size, these things are very bright. I used them to replace burnt out lights behind several dashboard buttons. In the attached picture, the OE incandescent bulb used to light up the words "cruise control" has nothing compared to how intense the other symbols are. The only major gripe are the fairly delicate leads that are weakly soldered on the boards, which makes manipulating them a tedious process. None, after a couple months, have yet to flicker like other LEDs, so I would recommend these for those needing both something bright and reliable.

Very bright. Afternoon reading the reviews I did take it apart and fill the endcaps with silicone in hopes to trap out the condensation problem. The particular model I got I wasn't able to seal around the glass internally so I just did the outside creases. I've been through two minor rain storms in Arizona and haven't seen any condensation buildup or dead LEDs so far. Paired it with rough country 50" mounts for my jeep tj windshield and ended up having to get longer mounting bolts and rubber washers. Over all I'm very happy for the price. But I've only had it for about a month. I have KC halogen lights and this bar blows them out of the water.Update: bought in may and it's now september. It does whistle at about 30 mph. I'm now seeing the condensation despite my attempt to seal it off with silicone, no dead LEDs as of right now.

Price is great. Fit was okay with a little fidgeting. Like another reviewer noted, "get a few threads going on every bolt before final tightening." The finish of the product was highly disappointing. Although the frame was wrapped carefully, it's apparent that before it was wrapped for shipment the part was heavily mishandled. See the pictures I've posted. The scratches are clearly visible with the seat raised as well as lowered. Very disappointed.

I absolutely love this stuff! I've used it for over 3 years now and have had no issues with dry rot on the tires and very little dust collection! Also makes it very easy to clean your rims. I convinced the local car wash to start using it rather than the sponges that don't get in all the crevices.Spray all your tires and rims then wipe the rims down and by the time you are done wiping down the rims you will be ready to go. (Wait for everything to be dry after washing it before you start)

Light looks great, feels great and I couldn't wait to install it on my atv.  When performing a function test, the last series in the lights didn't come on at all.  Still want the light but looks like I'll have to return this one and get one that works correctly.  Probably would be 5 stars if it worked right.  Oh yeah, no wiring harness came with it, just the mounting brackets. UPDATE, 2 weeks later I get a replacement light, I was all excited.  Plugged the light into my power source, SAME PROBLEM.  Not recommending this company (at least not at this time) to anyone.  Should've spent the extra cash and got one that worked.  I could've already been on TWO rides and used them but nooo, I went cheap.  Lesson learned.

Installation was easy, and it looks great! All connections matched up with factory connections without any modifications necessary. All of the parts seem to be high quality and well made. You will need to remove your rear bumper if you have the factory rear bumper, but that's also a very easy process. And you will need to remove only the two inboard screws of your left taillight. Installation takes approximately 45mins to an hour for someone who has moderate experience in vehicle maintenance/installations... maybe an hour and a half for someone less mechanically inclined. Highly recommended addition to your Wrangler!If you found my review helpful, please feel free to indicate it below. Thanks! :)

Installed this in the opening below the grille on a 2005 Ford F150 regular cab truck. Fits perfect and is super bright! The mounts included and the light bar are made of very high quality. I haven't had any issues with water getting in the lense either. The third picture is just the light bar on, no daytime running lights or head lights, just the 20" light bar.

I would have given this product 5 stars but the instructions left a few steps out.  Go to YouTube and find the Teraflex install video for this leveling kit.  They don't tell you to remove the brake line holders, so watch the video a couple of times.  This kit is great if you want to give your Jeep a little more aggressive stance.  After I finished my JKU had the look it should have rolled out of the factory with.  Not too high and doesn't look like a station wagon either. I was able to do the job myself. Use jack stands and a couple of jacks.  When you are finished with the install remember to get an alignment.The attached photo is my red Jeep with the Teraflex kit with 33" tires beside a factory height Jeep with the original 32" tires.

I'm Actually surprised with the quality level of this cover. I wasn't expecting much due to the price but needed something for a road trip coming up. I think this will be around for a long time. Just for sizing reference in case anyone was confused as I was, I have a 2015 Indian scout with a windshield a back rest and saddle bags. This fit like it was designed for it. I bought the "Fits to 108" size kinda just hoping I was close but it fits very well on the scout. Seams are sewed tight and has metal grommets for locking it around the wheel. Havent had it sit in the rain but I would think it should be very water resistant. At this point I would have to say for the money you would be hard pressed to find a better value. Even comes with a carry bag that it actually fit back into lol. Hope this helps somebody out!

I recently graduated college and I had a lot of bedding and towels left over from my dorm. I wanted to keep these for my next move but found that they were taking up a lot of room in plastic tubs. I decided to put these space max jumbo vacuum storage bags to the test. The box was really well packaged and it was easy to take out the two jumbo bags and the pump. These were the biggest space bags that I had seen and were perfect for my college things. In the first bag, I put in a comforter, sheet sets, pillow cases, a pillow, a blanket, and a bunch of towels in it. I tried the hand pump and I could not get it to work. I was really disappointed because it would not work on either of the space bags. So I hauled out my vacuum and did it that way. The zipper seal was really hard to close and it kept on going off of the zipper track. I had to go section by section and close it with my fingers instead of the zipper on both of the bags. It was pretty easy to vacuum the air out of the bags, but a small amount of air did get back into the bag when I stopped vacuuming to screw the cap back on. I was pleased that I could fit all of my college things in a bag and it made my pillow super flat in it too. The second bag went the same way, but I was able to put my winter clothes in it. It was nice to get rid of bulky tubs and have small clear plastic bags instead. I like how you can see what their contents are and they're perfect for small spaces.I like this product but had a problem with the hand pump not working and the zipper in addition to letting air back into the bag when I was screwing the lid back on. If these problems were to be fixed, I would provide a higher star rating.I hope that this review has been helpful to you!

Having read a lot of the reviews I was a bit hesitant to buy this, but the fitment and quality weren't an issue. Firstly, these jackets run small. Like realllly small. At 5'11" and 190lbs, I figured I would be a large. Taking some advice from the other reviews, I ordered an XXXL. It was right on the money! One reviewer wrote that the front zipper rides kinda high on your stomach, which it does a little. But it doesn't really matter because if you use the big Velcro strap around your waist to keep the back protector in position, you'll find that it's fine. The mesh that the jacket is made from is fairly comfortable on its own, if you're riding in the summer. But a long sleeved shirt might be a better idea if you were going to be riding all day. I imagine it would irritate your skin pretty quickly. The quality is actually pretty good. A few reviewers thought the quality was ok for tooling through the woods, but not much else. I think that's pretty accurate. There's enough plastic to save you from grazes, but no real padding behind any of it. For $40, I think it's decent enough for riding around with your kids on a dirtbike. But if you're a fast rider and want real protection, go spend a bit more money.

Really really bright.  I've had them on for 4 months now and exposed them to a lot of rain.  No problems leaking.  I've seen other LED lights like this on other vehicles and boats and they are nowhere as bright as these.  They also have a pretty wide beam so they are exceptional for off roading where you need to see that bear off to the side in the bushes about to run across the road.

I just received my new tires today and wanted to get a quick review in since nobody has posted any photos yet.I haven't had a chance to install the tires, mainly because I ordered new hubs and bearings assemblies which haven't arrived, and didn't see the point to mounting them on soon to be replaced hubs.Regardless, I was EXTREMELY impressed when I laid eyes on these babies. They look amazing and have a very aggressive looking and deep tread pattern.

I not only disliked the yellowish color but since they were at least 6 years old, I decided to replace them.These 6000K HID bulbs are exactly what I wanted.Replacing the bulbs was fairly easy considering what the manufacturers have done to cars to make them difficult to work on. There is a difference in the base of the bulbs compared to the factory bulbs but I'm chocking that up to new technology.Removing the bulbs from the hard plastic screw on container while wearing latex gloves to avoid putting my skin oil on that bulbs the only confusing part was a small white ring. This thing does not get used. I believe it is there to stabilize the bulbs in the packaging.Not to much to say other than make sure the electric "wire" running from the tip to the base faces the bottom or you will have a shadow.The bulbs have been in the car for a bit now and I really prefer the light color and the amount of light these bulbs display.

I saw some really good work on the reviews through their pictures, and I also saw some really crappy work too. Overall, the Talon sheet delivered, and is fairly easy to manipulate. I wanted to keep some lines of my FDE Glock visible through the grip. I did not like the look of the all in one piece that Talon provides. I think it's pretty tacky and does not fit properly. I did my best to measure everything and ended up using sticky notes to draw the outline, but some of it came down to a measuring tape. At first, I almost wanted to cover the entire grip like a stippling job with a nice custom line through the palm and thumb areas, but I went the simple route instead. I ended up buying 3 sheets, but only needed one for my Glock. I used another sheet for my laptop, and some for a small flashlight. I also used a blow dryer to heat it up, and something to roll over it to make sure it sticks. I have included pics. I do love the product, but there are MANY CHEAPER options. You can buy a 12" by 6' roll for about $30, and it is the EXACT same stuff. Having done this with the Talon grip sheet, I would rather buy the big rolls and have enough for steps on my deck, among anything else I could think of. I recommend you check those products that offer much more for you dollar, than Talon Grips.

Bought as a starter for a 7 yo. Poorly packaged and a couple dents but that was expected after reading the reviews. I bent them out and added a couple Harley decals over cracked paint. Started right up and he took to it right away. Made sure the govener was lowest setting. He can even start it, push it, etc. perfect size. Wont have to mow the lawn for a while. Im sure hell learn a lot about chains, gears, cables and small engines over time.

OVERVIEWI have an all black on black jeep and wanted to either transparent spray the stock third brake light or consider other options.  This product gives the blackout look with the safety of full brightness, red light upon applying the brakes at a competitive price.INSTALLATIONThis could have taken me under a minute but I chose to remove my tire cover and spare tire since it was my first time and I didn't know all what I needed to remove. It still only took me about five minutes, over four of those were spent removing the spare.  If you open the tailgate, there are four screws on the backside of the arm holding the light and plastic sleeve. Unscrew those four screws and the stock light can slide out behind the spare assuming you didn't buy monster upgrade tires with a spare that stands as tall as you do.  Remove the wire harness and it fits perfect to this product for 2007 and up wranglers.LOOKSIt looks like a similar quality of the stock. I was worried it may look too digital with the LEDs but the further away I backed from the jeep, the more the red color blurs together similar to a stock light bulb. I'm happy about the blacked out look of the housing. See the attached photos. One of the boxed item upon arrival. One of it installed. One with the stock light, and one with the LED brake light on. The product looks just like the sales photo but I think it is even blacker around the LEDs than it looks in the sales photo due to glares or reflections on the image.PRICE$$-$$$ out of $$$$$. This is a good quality price for this product ranging slightly below the average cost for comparable LEDs. However, out of the blackout styles, this was the most competitively priced and best looking. I received a discount on this product for my honest review but I would have paid full price.

For easy touch ups or full body panels, this  is the absolute best clear coat in a rattle can!  100% factory quality clearcoat. Sprays on evenly & no nozzle drips!! This is not the same clearcoat as your typical over the counter ones. This has the clear and the hardner mixed in. The top of the van has the orange button on it that you have to remove and flip the can to activate it.It's easy to do. Just make sure you shake it up a bit and your good to go. Keep the can about 8 inches from the item being sprayed & 15 min between re coats. You can heat gun/hairdryer to speed up heat curing. I left it out on a sunny hot day and it did the trick

These are nice and bright. I use one on each side of the windshield of my Jeep. One thing to be aware of if you care about radio communications is that these lights are extremely RF noisy, particularly in VHF.Edit after one year - I bought two of these. One has completely died, the other has 3 of its 9 LEDs out (see image).

I don't know why my truck didn't come with tow mirrors. I have a '13 F150 SCrew with the Max Tow package, it has every other factory tow item including the shorter gear ratio and trailer brake controller. Regardless, I need to tow a camper and the regular mirrors do not cut it.These mirrors show up in a big box and come with two different style truck adapters. The adapters are for specific year trucks and you just pick the one that your truck needs. To setup the adapter you need to give each a quick clean with alcohol and stick on the foam pads. They stick on the section that presses up against your vehicles mirror.Installing the mirror is incredibly simple and takes seconds to do so. Just simple slide the assemble most of the way over your vehicles existing mirror. Before it is all the way seated you slide in the adapter so it matches the contour of your existing truck mirror frame. Now push the mirror the rest of the way making sure the adapter is fully seated. You should be able to look through the thumbscrew hole to line up the adapter. Now screw in the large thumbscrew. You're good to go.Adjusting the mirrors takes a bit of work, especially if you are alone. They are pretty snug in the housing so they take some force to adjust. I think this is good because they do not move at all when they are set.The mirrors give you much more visibility along the side of your trailer/camper. I could see cars that I couldn't see with my factory mirrors and I could see the back corner of the camper when backing up. They fit the truck incredibly well too. Almost unnoticeable unless you're looking for a tow mirror. They are not like the big ugly velcro strap type. They have two little cutouts on the inside to expose your signal LEDs.Removing the mirrors is incredibly simple. Just loosen up the thumb screw a bit and slide them off. The adapter will simply fall out of the mirror channel.You can probably tow without tow mirrors and you may not have a problem. But I am a big fan of doing everything I can to be safe.

Being the guy who waxes the 5 cars in the family I'm always looking for a better more efficient method. These microfiber bonnets looked like a good idea for removing the wax after the application. Using a paste carnauba wax I found that the bonnet filled up with the wax residue rather quickly. The wax in the bonnet was also getting hard due to the friction. The package indicates you should use a brush to remove the wax after each panel, but that didn't work for me. I instead used a microfiber towel which I could turn frequently to remove the wax and then tried the second bonnet just to polish after the wax was removed. Haven't noticed any swirl marks and it looks good. I just don't know how much extra shine was attributed the blue bonnet. Probably would work better for apply the wax, but I don't see that as a real benefit. The packaging recommends microfiber for buffing, removing wax, polishing &finishing. I would be afraid to use this for buffing for fear of burning the paint. A foam pad would seem safer.

So far, I have only installed the controller. I will update after hauling a load using the brake controller.INSTALL; Very easy to install, assuming your vehicle is prepped for a brake controller. I simply connected the vehicle factory pig-tails to the included harness and crimped, added an electrical tape wrap to hold wires together and look pretty, picked my spot and two screws later its done! (Ok, I'm picky so I measured and remeasured, thought about it, and measured again. Took me 45 minutes to do, but the actual "install" was more like 10 minutes or less.)Plug and play after that... Can't wait to get it set up for our new camper!*Update- after hauling a large camper I can say this is a great controller! Having the proportional brake application made the vehicle tow in town almost like I wasn't towing. Adjustments to the amount of brake force were quick and easy. Definitely worth the purchase price and then some!

This is a must-have accessory for any Jeep JK, especially if you have a soft top. Mounting was straightforward and quick. Just remove the two front seat bolts with an 18MM wrench, slide the box in, and rebolt. You have to remove a small plate that holds the two wiring harnesses under the seat, but that's easy to do also with a T30 Torx. One thing I did differently is to simply push the wiring harness towards the center of the Jeep, as opposed to attaching to the left side of the driver seat.  Looks cleaner.I use this mainly to secure weapons and my wallet when I go biking, etc. I can fit a Glock G35 and a Glock G42 plus my wallet with a little room to spare.  Very secure, extremely well made, and tough!

These go on easy and look great.

After one single year on my jeep these covers will surface rust like crazy and look like garbage.(even with using no rust spray) I am attaching photos to see.  I decided to clean them up and Plasti Dip them.Now, they look amazing in my opinion and won't rust anymore. WELL WORTH the price of one can of Plasti Dip.

Bought this for my new to me 2008 Chevy Tahoe which lives outside hoping to protect the dashboard and black leather seats from the sweltering TX sun. The fit and finish on the shade is phenomenal. As others have said there is like a 1" gap in parts, but if that gap wasn't there, it would be a headache to get in and out of position. Slap it up there, flip the sun visors down to hold it in place, and you're good to go.

I'm allergic to cigarette smoke so I can't say whether this ionizer removes smoke smell from a car or not, but I volunteer for a local dog rescue group and I'm called on to pick up dogs and transport them to their foster family at least once a week.  Despite my best intentions, the car often has a lingering "doggy smell", so when I was offered the opportunity to receive a promotional discount on this product in exchange for testing it and offering an honest review I gladly accepted.  I've had it plugged into my car's power port now for a few days now and I can definitely tell the difference.  The car smells fresher -- sort of like the smell in the air after it rains, and I don't smell "dog" anymore.  So far so good then. I love dogs but don't want my car to smell like one, so I'm delighted by how well this is working!

Being this light bar was the exact size I wanted i got it even though it was a slim design. It's not all that bright but you get what you pay for and I really just wanted it for looks. It acquired moisture within a week so I took it apart (like 8 screws) and put silicone around the lens and in all the screw holes. If you're putting in on a 4 wheeler or boat it wouldn't be a bad buy once you silicone it.. as for on a truck, i can barely tell it's on with my HID headlights and fog lights. If it wouldn't have gotten the moisture I would have given it a 4 star just based off the price lol

I was sent to sets of rear rotors, but amazon fixed that. Back rotor was too big, had to upgrade to a double piston caliper on the rear, works and looks great.

Very well made... but remember folks these are laser sharp pencil beams... UPDATED: mounted on 2013 BMW GSA. First night time ride in low light desolate area....very focused beam with a estimated 20' degree spread. Signs are easily visible at 1/2 mile as well as anything crossing the road. But be advised these light are blindingly bright to oncoming trafffic. ...

Major bummer.  Even though it states 4.5mm valve stem compatible, the outside diameter of the tool is just a bit too large to fit on the exhaust side of most 4 cyl/16 valve motorcycle engines.  Missed my return window by a couple weeks.  =(  I'm sure it works great on larger heads but won't do me any good.

I was hesitant on getting this, but for the price, worth the risk, plus Prime return an option if not what I had wanted. This was super easy to install, clean the area, center over the light, done. The instructions are in a Chinese dialect, but the pictures are easy enough. I used 3m tape, it is sturdy and snug, no gaps. Very happy with it, it passed the wife approval so I'm good. No issues opening hatch, clears antenna fine.

Cheap crap, fell apart after 6 months of VERY light and occasional use to fill my kids bike tires. It was never dropped, or mishandled, and I was the only one using it. The needle on the gauge fell off. I would say you get what you pay for, but in this case I don't think I did. many others have had problems with the chuck falling apart, which would be an easy fix, but the gauge is harder to find and much more expensive to replace.

This is the same rack licensed by Cabela's for their extended roof rack. We picked it up in a pinch and mounted it on our Durango. The mounts are the only -1 star. They're universal, but I had to get creative to get a snug mount. I cut up a bike innertube and wrapped my cross bars before installing the mounts. Overall, a good value.

Received these handles the other day and I'm pleased with them so far. After inspecting these I feel like they're made from good quality fabric, and that they'll last for quite awhile. Honestly, I bought these for cosmetic reasons more or less, and haven't really been using them with the exception of holding it while driving out of boredom. I expect the passenger side to get more use from other people than my driver's side. But I'm happy with the purchase and would definitely buy again if needed!

On the third spark plug I was removing with this tool, the top part of the handle broke.  This is made of very poor craftsmanship.  Sure it's only a bit over $6, but that doesn't matter.  I was only able to remove two spark plugs and then it was rendered useless.  Steer very clear of this product spend an extra few bucks for a better tool.

Update: I traded in the 2009 Altima coupe for a 2017 Toyota Corolla and of course I ordered this once again. The trick is when sewing on the 10 and 2 o clock positions don't use the stitching, instead stitch it using the small holes in the leather wrap itself. It closes the gap fully and looks good.Put this on my 2009 Altima coupe and it feels good and looks good and smells of real leather. I did have an issue with the product though because the stitching on the cover itself snapped in a few places. I contacted the company and they sent me out another one. The product is nice and customer service is good.

Install went well. Used a kfi winch plate mount. Had to do some minor plastic trim but with Dremel tool took about 10 min. Wiring harness was sufficient to give room to route wiring without headaches. I do not like the viper rubber hook stopper; have to unspool rope to attach. I have a kfi bumper hook stopper ordered, it is two pieces that attaches with bolts.Time will tell on dependability but Viper has good warranty!

With the 4.7 liter V-8 in my 2003 Dodge Durango occasionally suffering "rough idle" and the odd hiccup on the highway, internet research indicated the TPS (throttle position sensor) and the IAC (idle air controller) might be at fault. Considering the car has 100K+ miles, and both of these being electro-mechanical devices, I thought replacing them might not be a bad idea. I did clean the throttle body while doing the replacements, and I have attached a picture of the old IAC, as you can see that does have carbon deposits - I actually didn't know the carbon works its way back into the fuel intake, good thing to learn. The IAC is easy to remove, and easy to install, although you need to tease it into the throttle body, it keeps trying to come back out while you're pushing it in, thankfully the one (single) mounting screw is long. It takes a Torx-20 key, by the way, don't try to use a hex driver or other tool, you might ruin the head. I did not uninstall the throttle body, although, technically, I should have, to give it a full front-and-back cleaning. Call me a coward, I don't want to do things that might break other things as I am not an expert in cars and V-8s and things. After these two replacements, my idle, at around 600rpm with a warm engine, is slightly higher than it was before, but I did do an ECU reset after the install, this to make sure the ECU read the new components, rather than think it was still talking to the old units. I have diagnostic software that reads the ECU through the OBDII port, and I had that going when I reconnected the battery, a good way to make sure you didn't break anything while futzing with the connectors, but as it takes time for the ECU to relearn the engine, you'll have to come back here in a few weeks (late April) to see the final results. I replaced the IAC at the same time as the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Original-Engine-Management-99058-Throttle-Position-Sensor/dp/B0072PIJM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Original Engine Management 99058 Throttle Position Sensor</a>&nbsp;(more there!), at this point, there is no more rough idle, no more hesitation pulling away with a cold engine, the hiccups have gone, and no more error codes.

So far..... A wise purchase. The only issue I saw on the reviews, was that it is not properly sealed and leaked. My light bar has not seen rain, but I have taken it through a high pressure car wash several times and no signs of it holding water. The light is very bright and looks just like the ridiculously priced $300 light bars.

[Good]Heavy metal housing.[Bad]1) Back side leak with splash occasionally.2) I agree with others, it is not smooth movement.3) Heavy/thick hose might be good for some work,but I changed to thinner type.4) Factory debris inside so I rather buy clear plastic one if it exist.

Works really good. I used it to clean my 2 bbl Rochester carb on my 55 Bel Air. It did an amazing job cleaning out the gunk and even removed surface rust. I for got to take pictures but I recently used this to clean my door latch and lock assembly. It was somewhat ceased and I was having a hard time locking an unlocking the door. Here is a before and after. It works like it was brand new! I left it in for about 2 days (restoring my car when I get time) so I don know if it works as quickly as others have claimed but if your part is really bad, leave it in for a day or two.

I don't like that there is no hard surface over the led's. it is just an aluminum tray filled with lights and silicon. I farm and I worry seeds or straw will get into the gel and tear it, but we will see. That aside, it is insanely bright. I purchased an Anzo 5 function similar to this one before.Comparing the two:The anzo had four reverse leds die within a year. (Which is why I changed it). It was more durable looking with the hard case and had a smoked lense (which I did not really care about).Both Anzo and Redline have clear lights, but Redline's brightness blows Anzo out of the water.I did like the led set up and color a little better on the Anzo and as I said durability consernse me on the Redline.As long as it holds up my vote is on the Redline.

I don't always right a review, but when I do it means I'm super excited about the product! After trying other sealants that wanted me to apply their products on the car during a wash, I felt a void in the peace of mind I was seeking when attempting to protect my vehicle from the Hawaiin elements. I decided to give this product a try since I've always trusted Chemical Guys. I must say that when I finished buffing it off, the car was brilliant! I almost felt that I didn't need to apply wax but I did anyways for good measure.

As lightweight as these are, they have been really useful for doing maintenance on my car. The fingers allow me to pick up tools and gauges easily, while still maintaining some feeling in the fingers. They aren't bulky and they still allow my hands to fit into tight spots. The moulded, hard knuckles prevent me from smashing my knuckles, too. The backs of the gloves near the wrists and fingers is breathable, so my hands don't get sweaty.The wrists adjust in 2 spots and they can be adjusted quickly. I like knowing that they won't come sliding off if part of my glove gets frozen to something I am trying to work on. When they get dirty, I let them soak in soapy water, swish them around a bit, and hang to dry.Please note: While this review was written completely of my own volition, I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

For the price is worth 5 stars but be warned if you plan on using this for off road/rough conditions the durability is questionable; the reason for the 4 star rating. Im using this as a headlight for my bicycle and after about 5 months of use the front plastic is starting to discolor and develop what appear to be stress cracks. The picture Ive left shows the issue I am talking about. Light output does not seem to be effected, at least for the short range I use them for. I also garage the bike when not at school, keeping its exposure the elements down.The housing seems durable and the paint has yet to chip or come off. Some loctite on the mountain screws should be used to keep everything nice and tight.As for the power rating they are closer to 14watts when I tested them with my multimeter. Cable sheathing is quite thick and the wires are thick enough for the application. I did enjoy the pre tinned leads on mine to keep things from fraying during the initial install.

Excellent LED replacements for my interior map and dome lights on my 2010 Honda Accord Coupe. I had replaced the original incandescent bulbs with a different brand of LEDs that I had purchased a few years ago that just weren't bright enough. I am very satisfied and glad I made the decision to go with these as they are significantly brighter than my older LED bulbs. The previous bulbs were around 80 lumens and these are rated at 200 lumens. This makes a huge difference and has significantly increased visibility inside my vehicle. I did blow a fuse during installation of one of the bulbs but that may have been a personal error so I will not count that against these. They look and feel like they are pretty good quality and I suspect they will last a long time. I actually left these on overnight a couple of times by accident and they did not kill my battery or lose any of it's brightness. The price is also very fair compared to all the other LEDs available on Amazon. I would definitely purchase these again and would recommend them to others.

Will update later if any issues occure.I installed this on my Mercedes GLK350, Mercedes are notorious for being picking with electronic items.  I gave this a shot  because of the price, Canbus compatibility, and the simple one plug install. The color output is 5500k to 6000k, the light output is comparable to 35w HID but less then 55w HID systems.  I have used over a dozen HID system and have used a handful of LED systems like OPT7 Fluxbeam (which are $100) and they are just as good from my initial impression, only time will tell if it will last like the OPT7 brand that cost twice as much.

This is a great part.  It fit perfectly.  Both lower controller arms I received had parts missing... The bolt on one and the grease fitting on the other.  It cost me $14 to resolve the grease fitting issue at a local store on rebuild day.  I missed my first weekend install as the unit never made it.  Amazon was great about getting me a new one for the next weekend.The arm fit perfectly.  I hesitated in replacing the lower control arms.  The springs and the upper arms were my target.  In the end we found the old lowers to have aging rubber on the frame side.These have contributed to the insanely solid ride I am getting now.  It was worth replacing this 13 year old part while in there doing the other work.

These fog are lights are a must. They are just as bright and white as HID lights, and they light up the road brighter than the stock halogen bulbs. The first photo is the when I only had the fog lights on. You can see they're a white color just like HIDs. And the second photo is the fog lights with the headlights on, and you can see the entire road, including the peripherals, are lit up brightly. I highly recommend these bulbs if you're looking for the persfect HID alternative!

They would be 4 star tires is they matched. The 2 front 8x12's indicate that they are directional with arrows and they don't have the yellow "SUN-F" on the sidewall. The rear 2 10x12's do NOT indicate they're direction and DO have the yellow "SUN-F" on the side wall. Now my Yamaha Rhino looks like it has mismatched tires on it. It bothers me. So hence the 2 stars. They're also an SOB to mount up over other name brand ATV tires. Plan on paying someone to get them on if you're a DIY guy like me. I managed to get 1 mounted myself the other 3 weren't  going on without a machine.

This is a good price for this set.If purchased separately, you will pay more.Forget about price for a moment.  Does this work?  Yes.  This set will function just fine for any small car that you can get the jack under.  2 tons is 4,000 lbs.  You are only lifting and supporting 1 corner at a time.  So you should be fine with any vehicle smaller than a 1/2 ton light truck.  Just be sure that your lifting needs are within the range of this jack.  Obviously, I will not be using this with a lifted truck, or lowered Fast & Furious import.I have never felt unsafe under a vehicle supported by these jack stands.  This jack has lifted every variety of sedan, subcompact, mini-van, and passenger vehicle that I have slid it under.  Never once, did it fail to lift due to being under powered.  And luckily for me, I haven't seen the seals fail.  No hydraulic fluid leaks.I know, it takes a lot of space in the truck.  But it is worth it.  If you've ever used the scissor jack that comes with a car, you will swear by this jack.No blow molded case.  But I can live with that.  This will be worth every penny in the middle of the night, on the side of the road, during a winter storm.  You try changing a tire during a snow storm, or Pineapple Express atmospheric river.  The El Nino will drench you, along with 50 MPH winds to freeze your fingers off.  No, you will not build your career as a mechanic on this floor jack and set of jack stands.  But you will love this once you have to change a flat.

Fit my 2009 xt250 perfectly. Durable construction with nice finish. It does have some flex if you pick the bike up by the grab handles as they are moved off the frame onto the rack. Still plenty strong to lift the bike. It is a bit heavy as it is steel construction. An aluminum rack would be lighter but you would pay a pretty price for it.

I don't usually write product reviews, but this product completely amazed me at how good it worked. Had the graying on the plastic around the front end of my S10 and the bumper. Used goo gone to strip it then applied 3 coats of forever black and it looks almost as good as new. Only used maybe a 1/6th of the bottle. Good idea to use painters tape if you are not the best at painting like me.

I didn't buy these on Amazon, but thought I'd review them here. I bought my truck and it had these same flaps already installed on their rear, so I bought the matching ones for the front. In a word, just awesome. Easy install, about 10 min a side and that's being generous. I took my time...They fit against the fender perfectly and have about a 1/4" clearance when the tire turns. On a 2015 F350, they do not use the QuickTurn fastening system. Just the two existing fender bolts, and one additional underneath into an existing hole. They look very good and provide excellent protection. These are a bargain in my opinion. Pics attached. Sorry for the dirty truck.

These work great! I camp in my car frequently but like the fresh air. These cover the rear door windows of my '95 Toyota Land cruiser perfectly. The regular size is too small, if you have a taller car/window area, you'll need the large size. They're very stretchy but if they're not tall enough you can't have your window lowered all the way - these are tall!. Either way, these keep out bugs as well as offer some privacy and shading as they're dark and can't see from outside in. These go completely over the window and are super easy to install and remove quickly, very functional.

This is some great vinyl wrapping.  It gives regular surface items the custom look and feel of carbon fiber.  The surface texture of it isn't the same as the 3M brand wrap, but it looks good.  I used it to cover a custom RAID Cloud Storage case I build for my server and it turned out really good.  If you get the vinyl application spray and the squeegee, it makes the installation a lot easier.  I also used a heat gun to help dry the spray up, and to heat the vinyl up enough that I could stretch it a little bit so that it would contour to the rivets on the case.  Just heat it up a bit so it will stretch, and then pull it over the surface tightly, while still applying a little bit of heat.  Then once you get it down, squeegee it out and when it cools, it will shrink a bit so that it will contour really well.  This roll comes with a lot of the wrap, so if you are planning on wrapping a hood, or doors on a car, you will have plenty with this one roll.

When I bought my 2500 HD truck it came with a Class-5 hitch which is larger than the traditional Class-4 hitches most trucks have.  I didn't realize that also meant that my safety chain hooks would be too small to fit into the holes built into the hitch.  To resolve that problem, I found that these D-rings look and work perfectly on the back of the truck.  Now I can easily and quickly install my safety chains and know they provide just as much safety as needed without modifying my truck.These are heavy duty D-rings and Im really happy with the powder coating on them.  Ive attached a picture to show how they look on the truck.  To be fair, these pictures were taken after a 15,000 mile trip, towing the entire way up and down the Alaska Highway!  These pictures show how little wear and how solid these D-rings are since the usage on a trip like that only consists of a few scratches.5 stars, great looking, functional and heavy duty!

With 3 different size to set up with and made with a very strong material, this brackets fit their purpose with no modifications needed.

These are pretty poorly made.  They work and are very bright but the quality of the manufacturing is not good.  Mine came assembled with the gasket not in place and completely hanging out of the front of one of the lights as shown in photos.  I imagine this means it is likely not water tight.  I would send them back for a replacement but I'm sure the replacements would be exactly the same.

This is a review of the Nilight NIL101 Car Charger 12 Heavy Duty Extension Cord. 12/24V.(Cable is 12 long and weighs 10.4oz.)Summary  I was looking for a cord to give me more flexibility in using emergency lights and my portable air compressor. This is doing what I need and works well for what I am using it for. (No fuse was acceptable as this is plugged into both a fused outlet and a fused device.)ProsThis cable is thick as you see in the image. It feels very strong and the endings are a good size. The female socket is snug for my device cords and the male end has a good tension which keeps the cord from falling out unless you specifically do so.ConsWhen I removed the end of the plug, there is no fuse and the wires are smaller than I anticipated.This is rated up to 200watts which has a maximum amperage of approx. 16.66amps.  From a quick check online, the proper gauge is approximately 12AWG for the specs of this cable. (12 foot by 200watts at 12V DC.) There is nothing in the listing or written on the cable  case to indicate wire size, however, I am positive it is not a 12 AWG.So final rating is 3 out of 5. One star lost for what appears to be insufficient wire size inside and one star off for lack of a fuse.As with all my reviews, I will update this review should it develops issues with ongoing use.

Great Product for the price. Fits well. Uses stock hitch for safety. Finish matches other current Chinese products like yitamotor windshield brackets and smittybilt carbine front bumper. I tow at max capacity and I didn't feel comfortable using the questionably built receivers in the Chinese bumpers that don't come with safety chain provisions other than the d-rings. I really wish they would modify this style to meet up with the factory fenders instead of leaving a gap.

Very good cover, especially for the price. Waterproof, elastic ends, and a clip strap for one end. This thing works for my CBR and my Versys. It doesn't completely cover my Versys due to the high windshield, but it completely covers to the ground, my CBR. I bought one for my CBR then a second for my Versys after I saw how great they were. I've never had one blow off either bike, even in high winds.

I bought this sunshade for my 2016 Camry. I got the extra large size and it fits very well. I just pull down the fold-able sun visor to keep it securely in place. So far my car has been kept cool thanks to this sunshade plus I have tinted windows on my car so with this sunshade nobody can see inside my car now. And another great thing is it helps my dash cam blend into the background. Thank you.

I used all of the provided screws.  Didn't have to remove wheels, only had to drill the bottom hole going from underneath for these front ones.  I followed the instructions and they are on tight and look great.  You can turn your wheels to make room for drill.

Lot's of research and this is the one I chose.  I chose this light due to the excellent reviews, I liked the look in previous buyers pics, I like that this is a made in USA product and I like how easy it was said to install.  I just went through the install process tonight. I was a little worried because all the different headlights and reviews... it seems everybody had something to say about having to modify this or that to get different headlights to work.  Well, I listened to eagles directions and got a new headlight bracket as they said my 2012 street glide flhx would need one.  Only I ordered this one due to it being a fraction of the cost. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0758BZ12C/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1First off, the description of this headlight says it includes an extra wire adapter to make it connect to the stock setup. I tore the box apart looking for it to no avail, but I decided to take my bike apart..  and I then found I don't need an adapter, it was straight plug and play (simple three prong plug). Again 2012 street glide flhx, no heated grips or anything. Never found the wire so I am guessing they knew I didn't need it and didn't send it. No biggie!I connected the light and turned it on before installing to the framework, it shot out a giant laser beam and I got excited. I grabbed my cheap headlight bracket they said I'd need but again I bought a cheaper version I found here on Amazon.  I fiddle around a bit to see how it all fit but you basically take off all the stock stuff and line up the holes and put this one on.  All lined up well at first and it ended up working great. Two things to note if you want to save a few bucks and buy the one I listed and have my same year bike (can't speak to any others). The final bracket that covers the headlight and makes it look clean, the one that uses one screw and the first piece you take off, yeah that one.. the stock screw to your Harley is too small in diameter to catch the new bracket hole.  Luckily I searched my garage and found one near the same length of stock but a tiny bit wider. I also put a little weather stripping between the top of the bracket and the base of the headlight bracket as it had a little play at the top while the bottom near the screw* was snug. *Have a stubby philips to get between this screw and your fender, it's a tight fit. or use a mulit-tool which will be shorter.  Second... You have adjust the headlight before putting on that final cover I just spoke of, as the stock cover will cover up a couple of the adjustment screws that the stock setup leaves open for adjustment, so you don't have to take anything off.  Not a big deal, adjust it before putting on the final cover and you're good.I watched a video on youtube about setting the right headlight beam height etc..  Was super easy and adjusted using an alan wrench for horizontal and vertical settings.Finally,..  The light is super bright, the beam is wide and it's white. No more boring yellow that reminds you of sitting on grandmas porch.. Didn't even see a moth!  Highly recommend. Not cutting, no splicing, no soldering, just plug and play and now you will be seen, hopefully well enough to pull that cagers attention from their cell screen in time.  And the price! Oh yeah the price!  Fraction of what Harley charges, great quality and again American made.  I will give it some more time as it's brand new in this household, but great start, very impressed.

I purchased this winch for Polaris RZR 570 and I couldn't be happier that I did. I've had it installed for about a month and so far I've had no issues with it. As a matter of fact, it actually paid for itself on my first ride out. Due to conflicting work schedules with my friends, I tend to ride solo quite a bit. On my first trip out with the winch I encountered a marshy sand bar that turned out to be a lot nastier than it looked. I used a tree saver strap to hook up to a nearby tree and within a few seconds the Superwinch had me out of the mud and back to riding. I've used it two or three times since and it's worked flawlessly every time I've called on it. It works smoothly, quietly, and quickly. Installation was simple and I did it all myself in a few hours. The most time consuming part was running the wires so that they were hidden for a clean installation. For the money you won't find a better winch for your UTV/ATV!

I bought this cover for my spare on my Chevy K10 pickup. I put it over a brand new, unused BFG All-Terrain TA KO - 33/12.50/15. I could not have asked for a better fit. It is snug, yet easy to pull over the tire without fighting with it and deep enough to slightly wrap around the back side.I'm not sure why others had mixed reviews with a poor fit, but the XX-LARGE is said to fit a 33" tire and 13" deep. I would say this is completely accurate. The cover looks good, very well made and holds strong at 70 mph on the spare in the bed of my truck.

My old #4000 Fan-Tastic Vent Fan quit working-- for a while I could jimmy the knob and it would work, then quit.  Then it died completely.  I bought, then installed, this kit.  Fan STILL wouldn't work, so I had to get and install a new MOTOR assembly + Dome Switch too, then it worked.  Date on old motor:  04-96, APRIL 1996, it was nearly 20 years old, I'd say a "Good Run."Easy to install this Upgrade Kit, **especially** using Lever Wire Nuts I bought on Amazon [Wago 222-412 LEVER-NUTS 2 Conductor Compact Connectors 50 PK ].  Photos on "Instructions" were fuzzy, so I phoned Atwood-Dometic, where "Jerry" was MOST helpful, friendly and patient!  He guided me through the wiring and I did-it-myself.  This kit has the NICE added feature my old #4000 lacked: a REVERSE SWITCH.  Couldn't tell from diagram on Reverse Switch which setting pulls air from coach to outside, so I simply held a piece of paper up to the fan and the paper STUCK to the screen, so I knew it was set correctly [switch depressed in "forward" setting; AFT setting depressed pulls air INTO the coach].My old #4000 motor had a white wire (goes to Dome Switch) and a BLACK (not red) wire.  Instructions discussed RED (not black) wire, which is why I called Jerry originally.  He was such a gentleman it encouraged me to get my Fan-Tastic Vent Fan working again!  After I installed this Upgrade Kit, I had to called Atwood (2nd time) because the fan still wouldn't work.  I greased old Dome Switch, knowing they're prone to fail-- didn't help. Then I bypassed it by connecting white wire from motor directly to short white wire on Reverse Switch (9 o'clock position).  Fan STILL wouldn't work.  After this, I decided motor died.  Got new motor, installed it from atop roof.  Clipped butt connectors from white wire and black wire on new motor.  Attached a ring connector to white wire from motor, inserted onto new Dome Switch (came w/ new motor) and tightened Dome Switch while on roof w/ 7/16-in. box wrench.  Still on roof, threaded cut-end of motor's black wire into small HOLE next to Dome Switch.  Employed old clear plastic "U"-shaped clips to hold motor wires secure in channel on butterfly frame.  Made SURE I oriented motor assembly such that wires exiting motor were CLOSEST (not farthest) to Dome Switch.Back inside coach.  I had screwed a hook-eye into wood behind fan surround (PHOTO #1) & employed a copper wire to "hang" upgrade kit, as I installed kit myself, for hands-free operation.  PHOTO #2:  Shows red wire from motor plugged into 3-o'clock on Reverse Switch [after threading red wire through tiny hole next to Dome Switch, while still on roof, I crimped a female spade connector onto red wire's cut end]; also shows short white wire 9-o'clock on Reverse Switch to Dome Switch via butt-connector.  PHOTO #3:  Close-up near bottom end of Dome Switch.  PHOTO #4:  Final installation, fan blade is running, thank goodness.  PHOTOS #5 & 6:  Wiring on top side, Upgrade Kit, hanging by jury-rigged copper wire.  Have fun!

I was very skeptical that they could get a good fog light beam from an LED, but I took a leap of faith and bought them anyway.  I'm EXTREMELY pleased with the fog pattern.  Its extremely wide, and very short.  The cut-off is very sharp, so even though you're putting down a whole lot of light, its all on the ground so you're not blinding oncoming drivers.  Wouldn't want to use them on wet roads though, all that light will reflect right back up.  In the photo you can see, they're not glaring into the camera at all.

I use this on my car's exterior plastic and rubber (not tires) about once a month. I started using it when my car was about 6 months old and so far all the plastic looks new. My car will be 2 years old in December of 2017. I can't say whether or not it will restore old plastic, but so far it is keeping my plastic in good shape

So far I really like this rack. I've done some modifying to the Windshield to allow me to install a Yakima Boa Bike rack. I gave it 3 stars because of the cheap black coating and the where marks that were already on the bars while being wrapped in foam...Either it was previously used or the Black coating is that cheap. I think I'm going to re-coat it myself with something stronger.

Received a great product at a reasonable price. They came on time and undamaged. Well packaged and adhered very well. Good chrome and paint. One helpful tip is to use a straight edge ruler to install. Place the ruler on top of the ram door decal letters and place the hemi logo on the fenders. Give the logo an even gap similar to the ram letters or it will look out of place.

These are great little ditch lights that I added to my '03 4Runner. Really looks great up near the mirrors and makes for a very sporty looking rig. Added these in combination with the Blazer Spot/Flood combo 13" bars up front. These little guys are a very wide flood that really help illuminate everything around you, especially up. You won't get a ton of range but that's not the point, hence the big 13"s up front. Highly recommend!

This is quite an awesome trailer. I'm ranking this a 4-star vs a 1-star because the trailer is awesome, however the reason I SHOULD mark this as a 1-star is because the hardware to mount the shell to the frame wasn't included. Instead of the proper hardware, I received a Phillips screw driver?? why? I would rather have the hardware to properly mount the shell to the frame than a phillips screw driver, which isn't even needed in assembly..

First, a bit about which shade is which---the descriptions here can be confusing and the pictures don't always match up with the product you're ordering.  For 2007-2015 Wranglers, 2 or 4 door, all the product numbers begin with 13579., followed by two digits which designate which body style and how much of that style the shade will cover.  Here's the breakdown:.06  07-15 JK 2 door only.  Covers from the windshield over the sound bar to the rear of the roll bars where they begin to turn down..04  07-15 JK or JKU (2 door OR 4 door.). Covers the front seat area only from the windshield to the sound bar.  Shorter than the .06 version..05  07-15 JKU (4 door only.)  Covers from the windshield all the way back to the rear cross bar, the one with the interior light attached to it.  This is  the one I purchased.I installed this on a 2013 Sahara Unlimited with soft top.  I can't say how it will work with a hard top that has the removable panels.  The instructions include specific directions for those with that configuration.Installation was easy.  Took about 20 minutes.  The bungee cords will work around any attachments you might have hanging off the roll bars.  One suggestion:  the instructions have you first attach the velcro tabs to the front "footmen" which are the brackets the soft top clamps onto.  There's three  footmen and there's 4 velcro tabs  The footman at the center of the windshield gets 2 velcro tabs, the  footmen where the top clamps go get one tab each.  The instruction photos don't show the middle footman.  Nor do they show the two bungee cords sewn into the front hem, each with a small plastic hook on the end.  These hooks go into the footmen and add some rigidity to the front attachment of the shade.  I suggest you make the front velcro tabs as tight as possible so that when you un-velcro them when re-latching the soft top  (you have to do this in order to allow the top clamps to work) it makes them easier to redo the next time you put the top up.I would guess the shade blocks about 40-50% of the light, just enough to cut a blazing sun.  On the road at highway speeds there is no noticeable flapping noise.  In fact, my wife said it actually cuts the buffeting.  I can't say how the bungees and the mesh will hold up long term to the effects of sunlight.  Only time will tell, but the shade does come with a 5 year warranty.  I like the fact you can keep the screen installed year-round even with the soft top in the "winter" position (down an latched.)  Also, the shade will prevent sagging and water pooling if you cover the jeep in rainy weather.  I find this a big plus.If you drive your Wrangler in the "open air" mode this shade looks to be just the ticket.  Tight fit, economical and adds to the enjoyment of your open air motoring.  A definite 5 star product!ETA 9-5-15Some factual errors in the original review (my bad,  I missed one complete step):1.  The instructions do indeed include reference to the center footman and how to attach the TWO velcro tabs, one of which may be cut off should you desire.2.  Additionally the instructions do include reference to the bungee cords with hooks for attachment to the footmen.We just returned from 5 days in the Outer Banks which included a 2 1/2 hour trip to get there (and the same to return.)  I am revising my star rating to SIX (6) Stars!!

These springs truly give my Jeep Cherokee XJ the HD look and Minimal Lift For towing. Would highly recommend them to anyone that want to revive their XJ. They provided about 2 inches of lift which makes it about what a new Up Country Cherokee would have been at. UPDATE. Have had them on for about a year now and they are just as good as the day installed. I am not one for the super high lifts but this gives me what i need for towing and Some minimal Off-Roading. I also did new front springs at the same using The Same Springs that were in the UP COUNTRY Cherokee, Which has a Factory 1 inch lift above stock.Its been over a year now and the springs are doing great they did settle a little but I also added a JCR Vanguard rear bumper and and all my stuff in the back I did add a set of Zone Shackles to give me one more inch of lift so I could run 31w with out trimmng the fenders So I am at a net 2.5 inches to date here is alook at how it sets

At first I didn't think it was doing a good job but as I kept rubbing with the included microfiber towel, the shine progressively got better and better. Haven't seen how it beads water yet but if imagine it'll do ok. Easy to apply and work in. Make sure the vehicle is clean and cool before you start. When removing, use a microfiber towel and give it a good polishing action. You'll see a good shine in no time.

I bought this intake for my 2007 f250 6.0 because i noticed my mpgs were worse than usual, and since i had changed the air filter about 12000 miles ago i figured i should buy this instead of spending another $50 for the motorcraft filter. The truck does seem to run beter especially when you stomp on the accelerator pedal for takeoff and once you pass 3000 rpm you can really feel the difference. The engine on these trucks are really loud but you can still hear the noise the intake makes and it sounds good. I bought this intake primarily to save money on air filers, and to know when to clean it as opposed to relying on the air filter minder ford uses I like to see how dirty the filter is and with the stock ones you really can't tell. Installation took me almost 3 hours but i was drinking a couple cold ones enjoying the warm mid november southern california day making sure everyting was coming out right. After driving my truck for 500 miles with the intake installed the mpgs got a little better than what i was used to and the truck runs way better. If you are thinking about buying it just do it you won't be dissapointed.

Good emergency jack. It has some information on a sticker I have not seen on other jacks like this included in cars I have owned before. The sticker is not shown in the stock photo. For the weight capacity is lists the following information I don't see in the item description at this time. Weight per inch of height is as follows:5" - 1000lbs9" - 2000lbs11" - 2400lbs14" - 3000lbsSo, you have to jack it up to almost full extension if you want the rated weight given. It does have a nice long wide base, and is all metal.

Holy cow what a mistake that would have been.This cover is the bomb! Fits perfectly, great price, and looks great. Thank you Tyger for providing such an awesome product!

Originally 3 stars, Tried it...Kinda works...do if AFTER polishing... wears out in about 3 months, reapply. I used sand paper and rubbing compound and it lasted for about 9 months before fogging up. Afterward i just touch it up every 3 month using melamine and the headlight sealant and it works as well. See below for a video.It lasts about 3-4 months, however it attacts direct and eventually drys up. 1 bottle will probably last YEARS!To be honest, melamine and headlight sealant works well, but you should definitely wait until your headlight assembly gets so very foggy before EVER sanding your plastic head lamps... once you sand it you will need to maintain it for the rest of the life of the car... I made a quick video on using melamine and headlight sealant to do a quick clean: [...]  hope it helps... eventually if you don't want to constantly do it just replace the head lamp housing...

Good product!!  Do yourself a favor and rent/buy a coil spring compressor for the front.. that extra 2 inches makes it a pain to get back in on the drivers side.  Makes the jeep look way better!

Didn't like the way they sat on the ends of my grips. My bike is small so it almost widened my bars out a bit to much. Also they were a little hard to see out of as I would have to look over my arm. . so I just took them and mounted them down under the grip. Can see a little better out of them now and am very pleased with how they look

Almost perfect with one con.Pros: these led bulbs are really bright way better than yellow stock  bulbs that was in my Yukon, very  good quality.Cons:one and big one for me, It takes 1 1/2 to 2 seconds for the white to come on after you turn off signal flashing. The yellow turn signal flashing comes on immediately. its may annoying  but not huge problem. overall realty good switchback bulbs.

-Not the easiest thing to install... I did the cross-stitch on a 2001 grand marquis, it took me 3-4 hours, I ran the needle through all the holes once beforehand (instead of drilling them). a little tough finding the holes, but manageable, needles (two included for cross-stitch) go through the leather even if you miss. I ended up with over 6 feet of extra string on each thread... so you can Safely cut off 6 feet of thread for each one if you're doing the cross-stitch, which will save a lot of tangles. each thread is made to do the entire wheel using the other types of stitch (slant for example).  only real problem I had was the parts of the steering wheel that I had to skip over due to the steering wheel design... on my wheel it had two full five inch areas (see photo), so there is nothing holding it in these two spots, so it puckers a bit... other than that, the cover has a great feel, holds tight, and made the wheel much more comfortable.

Kit states there are 4 patches when actually there are 3. 1 patch arrived with dozens of holes in it due to the included metal scuffing tool being wrapped inside the patches before being inserted in its packaging. Instructions are not very clear either. I expect much more from a company like Frog Toggs. Pathetic!

Purchased a pair of these back on 11/22/16. One light has bubbling under the paint the other there is no paint just covered in corrosion, run my truck through the car wash 3 times a week during the winter and this still happens. Poor quality powder coating was used. Warranty is no good either, because manufacturer does not contact you back. Buyer beware!

It looks good. A bit tricky to place properly, but thankfully they sent me two and had a second chance do it right. Fits my 2013 Impala's steering wheel emblem just right. It's just a tiny sticker thought. Hopefully it will last. And I wish I had noticed there was a flat black one; the one I got is a bit too glossy.

I just got the Vibrant 1141 2.5" resonator installed on my 2016 GTI. I recently went Stage 2 on my car and had to have a downpipe installed, after the installation the car was loud and obnoxious when starting and I always used Vibrant resonators so I decided to give this one a shot. After getting it installed the car sounded stock again and it is loud when I want it to be loud! It was well worth the money

Only 2 weeks after installation and already has water in the housing.  I have only driven in the rain with them installed once. I had tried contacting the seller on September 2nd two weeks after installation it has been 6 days later and I have still yet to hear anything from them. And now it's past my window to return them.  Stuck with crap and these aren't even the cheapest ones on Amazon.  I figured if I spend a little more I get better quality and less of a shady seller...  lesson learned.

The front splash guards leave a gap with the body right above the rocker panel (see photo). No matter how many times I loosened and re-tightened the screws (as per the instructions) I wasn't able to fix the gap.I also found that at least three screws (self-tapping screws on the rear, and the front right) went all the way in but didn't really tightened.Not happy. I ordered a replacement which I'm hoping fixes these issues. I'll post update once I try the replacement.Keep in mind that they are not easy to install as it seems. Unless you have a lift, take your wheels off, or you have the right tools (SUPER stubby screwdriver and a 10 mm ratcheting wrench), it will be hard to get your hands in there and remove/place screws and bolt.Instructions are not provided but are easy to find online.UPDATE: The replacement arrived and I'm having the same issue. Front splash guards do not fit perfectly and there's a gap between guard and body, specially on the right side. The self-tapping screws on the rear splash guards won't fully tightened, I used Elmer's Glue as a threadlocker. Oh, and the replacement was missing two screws :(Do yourself a favor and get these tools for the installation. It will make it so much easier:OTC 4781 Super Stubby Screwdriver Set: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BVL7XPC?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s01GearWrench 9551 10mm Stubby Flex-Head Combination Ratcheting Wrench: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HBDWMA?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00

It's very flexible, doesn't fall apart, wraps tightly and keeps the engine bay significantly cooler. The ties are good and come in different lengths. It also deepened the sound of my exhaust a lot and I love the new sound. 50ft was just barely enough to wrap my Acura integra gsr DC sport header with about 3ft to spare.

Overall a solid fairing for the price. Was missing the 6mm bolt that attaches the mounting plate to the headlight adapter. Had to clean threads with a tap in both the headlight adapters. Fairing rides a little high so the headlight isn't completely centered up and down. Fairing itself is thick, bracket is adequate, but not much more.  Worth the price if your on a budget. Installed on 97 sportster 1200.

I used this to first shoot a little flake onto a rustoleum paint job. Then finished with several coats to lock the flake in and give everything a shine. I know what everyone is thinking. Obviously the rustoleum paint job was a cheap budget paint job and this was used to apply flake. I gave the rustoleum a couple of weeks to gas off before applying the flake and top coat. I am not recommending a rustoleum paint job. This is a review on how well this top coat is performing. It is over 6 months now and there is no flaking, peeling, bubbling or any other noticeable defect. It seems to have good adhesion given the circumstances. As far as clear coat goes I would highly recommend it. The picture is of my Jeep about a month after shooting the top coat.

Dont get me wrong I love my HIDs but I did not like a blinding people or people thinking that I always had my highbeams on so I looked into LED replacements in these did not disappoint they burn whiter and they are bright and they actually throw a concentrated beam and they threw quite far Im very pleased and Im looking forward to buying them for my newer to the 2017 jeep renegade. Oh and also the highbeams when activated actually produce more light so you actually have a low and a high beam.

The studs were good but the flange had rusted away along with the nuts. I couldn't use the nuts that came with the flange on the exhaust studs because they where different type of threads. The kit came with bolts,but I used the studs that were all ready in the exhaust manifold. I had to file the bolt holes out some to get it to fit but that wasn't as big a problem as it would of been trying to get a single piece flange on the exhaust. So I upload  pictures and a video to show you what it looks like. I used the 2 1/2'' 3 bolt on my 1996 Chevy truck. The exhaust shops was going to cut the pipe and put a single piece flange on at the cost of 75 dollars. I did it for 20 dollars.

So I got this for my husband to keep in his toolbox. He drives a truck with older chrome rims, and they tend to leak tire pressure in the winter. So, it's important to have a reliable pressure gauge in the truck at all times. We tested this gauge on a few different vehicles and a few different types of tires, and compared it to another gauge that we have. I am happy to say it is accurate! The hose is really flexible, so it's easy and comfortable to use. Heavy duty, so I don't have to worry about it breaking.The whole gauge is pretty large in size, so it doesn't fit in most roadside packs. However, it does fit in your trunk or behind your seats. The handle length is actually quite nice if you own a truck, since you don't have to bend down quite as far. However, it may be awkward to use if you drive a lowrider. I love the tire look of it, unique and fun!*I have received this product without charge or at a discount to write an HONEST review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are completely my own.*

Nice coloring each sticker has a adhesive back to it. The size is 3 x 9 inches these can be applied to any smooth surface and UV resistant. They are also suitable for indoor or outdoor use. What you get is a Ten pack of bumper stickers. You also get a ten pack of lapel pin decals 1.2 x  inches.Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount price for my honest and unbiased review.

I have these installed as Low beam and foglight bulbs in my 2011 Scion xB. VERY simple and easy install. I think these are the best LED bulbs on the market right now. You cant beat the price (believe me I tried!!). If youve been on the fence, give these a try. My car uses projectors for the low beams, so the light pattern is well diffused and doesnt blind on coming traffic.[My lights ARE properly aimed].As for the fogs, the light pattern is not as well controlled, which is to be expected with a reflector housing.The color temperature is pleasing to the eye and not too blue.  The throw of the light is much better than halogenSo far, heat doesnt seem to be an issue, as the bulbs with fans are prone to failure.I've included some install shots of the low beams only, comparing the LED to the halogen.

This bumper is exactly what I was looking for. While Stubby bumpers are more popular than full width bumpers, they have this "I jury rigged this" look.This grille looks like it could be from the factory, only more aggressive. In fact this looks like a more heavy duty version of the "Call of Duty Black Ops" bumper.Because this bumper fills in the gap between the fenders and the bumper this is sometimes called a "euro-bumper".Does the package come beat up? Yes. But with corner protectors and heavy foam wrapping that didn't impact the look of the bumper. This is a 120 pounds of cold steel. It probably doesn't matter what you wrap it in, in shipping the container is going to get beat up.The install takes about 30 minutes. The Bumper comes with everything you need except an 18mm Socket wrench, and an extender for the fog light wires, (&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/iJDMTOY-2-5202-H16-Extension-Wire-Harness-Sockets-For-Headlights-Fog-Lights-Retrofit-Work-Use/dp/B00H5A4I6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">iJDMTOY (2) 5202 H16 Extension Wire Harness Sockets For Headlights, Fog Lights Retrofit Work Use</a>&nbsp;)The bumper is HEAVY. You can also tell it is well made. The 12,000 pound rating on the winch plate makes it really apparent that this is not the stock bumper. This weighs about 10x as much and offers a real metal skid plate, where as the stock has a plastic plate that won't do anything beyond pack down the snow.I was blown away at how fast this arrived. It was 3 business days. I don't know that you can be guaranteed that speed, but it is nice to know they are fast.To co-ordinate shipping since this is a bigger item than what likely I wanted delivered to my apartment I contacted E-Autogrilles before ordering and they were really fast to respond. It means a lot to me that I can communicate with the manufacturer, as it shows they care about the product.The video shows the bumper install process, and the finished look.

I took a 45 minute highway trip with two of these racks and had no issues.  The mountain bikes felt very secure and at no point did I feel that they were going to get damaged.  One of the main reason for buying Yakima was that the bike rack required no extra components to install with my Subaru factory crossbars.  I have a 2013 Subaru Impreza WRX 5-door and the fitment was great and required no extra parts!  My only wish was that the bike rack when in closed position (no bikes) the front piece of the bracket did not  stick out so much, its not as aero dynamic as it can be. Overall, I am happy with the product and also amazon sold me the 5 position rack which is not the recalled one.

used on a metallic silver 2008 Subaru Legacy, initial results were outstanding, the whole process was an easy on easy off application. I let the wax dry as i washed the windows, it seemed to allow time for a good dry. buffing off was simple with a stack of microfiber cloths, one in one hand, another in the other rotating to fresh cloths often. this was all followed by a big plush microfiber towel as a buff.

Installed these covers in our 2013 Sonata. The front seats were an easy install slipping over the backrest and running the straps around the bottom. The back seat needed to be removed but the install was easy after that. The secret is to use the elastic loops and clips to pull all corners right under the seats. If you take your time you will get great results.

Seems like a good product at this price point and if it fit my car like it should, I would have given 5 Stars. I purchased the 200" for just under $25 & I got free shipping. I've wrote this review for people with similar cars to mine. 2013 Dodge Avenger SXT w/Spoiler (193" long front to back). I knew I wouldn't have the slack it shows in the photo with only 7 to spare, but hoped for at least a little bit. I realize it's a universal cover, but it should be 200" just in length not including some of the bumper area. Seems like its made more for older cars or was packaged wrong. This could possibly be next size down. If my car was any longer it would not have went on it at all. Packaging said 200". Cant tell if it was pkg'd wrong or not, no size on cover itself that I could find. Measures from well below where it starts around my front bumper going by the seams and where they curve. You can easily tell where the back curve starts for back bumper as it's a lot deeper and baggier, so I know by looking at it that the front tag wasn't sewn on in reverse by mistake, either. In measuring, I started at the back since it was easy to see where the bumper curve and to get 200 inches it goes into the baggy part for front bumper. Side coverage is good enough. To install, I put it around the front bumper first going by the yellow "front" tag which you will see when unfolding. It stayed in place good while I pulled it to the back. Fits really tight around most of the front bumper as you can see in the photo. Once I got it stretched around the back, I had to adjust it on the front several times to get it to fit the back better. What you see, is best I got! Its so tight it bends my antenna down. So, today I ended up uncovering most of the back bumper to take pressure off of it as its hard for me to reach and a pain to remove. If cover had a few more inches in length I wouldn't have had to go back and forth several times and it would of been a breeze to install instead of a pain. It's made like a fitted sheet so the bumper areas are added to the length at least in the back and looking at where the seams run and the curve starts, the Spoiler doesnt look like it made a difference in fit. When on the front bumper baggy part looks like it's made for a pointier front end and its baggy on the sides like for big chrome bumpers. I'm only using in a outbuilding garage to protect from birds nesting in eaves and dust that gets in, so I can't say how good it would be outside. It's pretty thin (you can see this in the photo of the front, it's so tight in that area you can see through it some). This also concerns me to how many times I'll be able to re-install it before it starts to rip. At least the inside is soft against the car, so I guess the tightness will be okay as long as I make sure its completely free of any dust/dirt before putting it on, which it should be anyway. Since it is so tight and indoors I had no reason to use the straps. Looks like they would work well if needed. I like that it came with a storage bag, will be handy when I use the car, or to throw it out in if it rips from being so tight!  So far, I don't think I would purchase this again in the future when this one wears out unless I try the next size up, which jumps all the way to 228". This one will have to last close to a year indoors before I would even consider it again and have to still be at this lower pricing. However, I would say this would work great on a shorter car and well worth this price. It seems well made and breathable. So far moisture hasn't been a problem. I live in the Midwest and we've had a lot of rain & humidity in the few weeks its been on. I only use my car once or twice a month, so it will not be going on & off much. Hopefully it will not rip. Will update in a few months if it doesn't hold up. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J0C8AHE/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0

I have a 2004 Can Am Outlander 330. This same battery was in my ATV until 2016!!! I maintain it with a Save A Battery 50 W battery charger that is attached 24 x 7  ([...]). I decided this year to order a new battery and the SAME battery that was in my ATV since the original lasted so long. This battery came dry with the acid in an easy to use plastic container. Just peel off the strip from the battery holes, tip the plastic container upside down and push it into the 6 holes. The acid goes in slowly. Let it sit for 2 hours and then attach your Save A Battery charger and let it charge until it is fully charged. Then install it in your ATV. I just took the ATV up hunting. The lows were in the 20's and it started the ATV with no issues. Pay the extra to buy this battery. You will NOT be disappointed..Pictures show the battery installed (2 views), the old battery is in the box and all charged up, the Save A Battery charger hooked up to the ATV showing a full charge.

IDK much about shoe dyes, but do know this is quality stuff. Comes with 1 applicator (but some good paper towels work, too. Would also advise having an old toothbrush for applying in  crevices.  Be sure you have plenty of ventilation, as it has a somewhat strong sweet smell.I'll include a before and after of a pair of bowling shoes that the product was used on.

The installation on a 2014 Ford Raptor took about took less than an hour and not only it looks good but it also seems to help with the fuel consumption.  I used CTS2 tuner to set the different driving patterns and so far I'm very impressed with the results.  With the filter installed and the using the tuner I am experiencing more HP (can be up to 25 hp more) and better gas mileage (averaging about 1mpg better than previous).  The instructions were clear and easy to follow but the pictures on the copied set of instructions could've been better.

I own a Ford Escape with the STs 2 liter turbo engine. This will fit any Ford Focus or Escape after 2013. You can hear the engine a little more, it seems to be less restrictive and allows more airflow which equates to better performance obviously, but naturally you do risk more contaminants entering your engine, I don't own my cars long enough for this to be a problem but if you do on your cars for a long time, the literature states that the filter is electrostatically charged to collect the particles. It is washable but they do require you to purchase their cleaning kit to  electrostatic-ally recharge the filter. Its a perfect fit didn't have to force it in. I noticed a moderate increase in MPGs (I accelerate very fast and  im sure if you drive like the average person, you will notice much higher improvements)

Great fit for my 2017 F250 crew cab.  Only reason I didn't give this a 5, is because I broke one of the T-bolts and the instructions were a little off. (Referred to wrong parts) . Not that assembly is difficult,  but it was slightly confusing,  since I tend to read them before hand.

This car cover is very nice, it has elastic on each end so it hugs the front and rear of the vehicle.  The directions are very straight forward for installing the cover and even explain how to accommodate the antenna on the roof of the Mini Copper.  The cover comes with a strap to tie it together and a bag to store it in when not in use.I received this cover at a discount in return for posting a review.

2008 jku with 35" tires. Ok I was a bit skeptical about buying this because so many jeepers say it's awful but many said they liked it. So I took a risk. I also so a recent review by xtreme terrain and he said it was a good quality lift and a great price. I waited a few months before this review.Install. You better have a friend and a lot of tools. It took me about 15 hours had to make a few runs to auto parts shop.  Directions were not that bad as long as your mechanically inclined.Lift height is great with no sag after 3 or 4 months.  I had no problem with missing parts but some nuts and bolts were in different bags.Pitman arm removal. Wow it sucked. I had to heat it up and use a puller.Performance. So I am not a hardcore jeeper and I know I won't be going to Moab because I can't afford that but I want it capable. I have used it on a couple trails with uneven terrain and hills ditches and water and it held up great.  Highway driving is ok. But last I checked when you lift a jeep the drive sucks regardless even if you buy a $2,000 lift. I gave it for stars for the following. Mixed nuts and bolts, and instructions are ok. But way more pros than cons at $500. No brainer.

I love them they work great , although when you plug in the aux to your mp3 or phone the sound and quality isn't that great , but the radio is awesome I can hear it through my helmet as well.. Reason its 4 stars is because the sound quality when aux cord is being used isn't great , overall best thing for your money

Well, these were a bit of a disappointment.  I'm doing a lot of custom wiring on my ATV, trailer and accessories.  I was needing 12 and 14g wire inline fuses and I both a set of both.  The ones advertised here are NOT regular ATO style fuses that most cars use.  These are mini fuses.Also, these come with 30amp fuses which are not compatible with the wiring.  Even the description states they should only be used with a maximum of 20a fuses so it seems rather bizarre they decide to ship them with 30a mini fuses.Recommended maximum fuse rating on 14 awg wire is really only 15 amps.  These being shipped with 30 amp mini fuses can be disastrous.  This is a good way of ending up with a wiring harness fire.I gave these 2 stars because I can return them.  If I had not bought these on my Prime account they would have gone in the trash and I would have given them 1 star.

Batteries arrived dead!  They are generic batteries without any print on them.  The seller sticks their own label on them.  A weight comparison to a brand name 12V 9Ah of the same size revealed this batteries are too light.  That means they do not have the plates in them to be 9Ah.  The 9Ah label is on top of the sellers label.  Removing it revealed a 7 print, see picture.

After reading all the reviews on this product I just had to try it. I live in CA and we are trying to cut down how much water we use. Plus people give you funny looks when you are hosing down your car or watering your lawn. Hence the reason for this purchase.This product is absolutely amazing. I took the advice of another reviewer and had one bucket with optimum and water and another bucket to rinse off the towel after each wipe of the car. Honestly words cannot describe how good this works. You just wet the towel with the solution and wipe down a spot. Even on glass it works wonders. It didn't leave any water spots either. I just wiped it dry with some microfiber Meguiars towels (which I highly recommend) and wholllah!! It even worked really well on my rims. Got the dirt right off.Get this product!! You won't regret it. And it's way cheaper than a car wash and way more satisfying as well.

These fit the map lights in my '02 Nissan Maxima. I've been replacing all my car's bulbs with led over the past 2 weeks. So far this is my 4th purchase of LUYED led bulbs and I've been happy with them all so far.On the left you can see the led map light is whiter than the standard bulb on the right. You can't really judge the difference in brightness but believe me the leds are much much brighter. They fit in just fine and aren't so long that they touch things they shouldn't. If you need brighter map light replacements give these a try. They're well priced and very bright.I received this product free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My review was not affected by the discounted offer. I only review products that I bought for my own personal use. If you find my reviews helpful please click "this was helpful".

This is one of the best products I have used. I try new products on the monthly basis (1 or 2) and I have been doing that for over 20 years. From them all, this is one that I like a lot.Before applying it, make sure your car is clean, I power wash it (2700psi / nozzle 40), completely dry it because this product doesn't like water at all. Make sure there is no direct sunlight over your car and the day is cool. Star applying it, use circular strokes, no need to apply a lot of pressure, wait 1 minute and wipe it off with a microfiber towel.

I think this goes to the POSITIVE (+)The 2 Screws in the CENTER of the Switch, I think go to the Park (running) lights and Tail lights.And i think the 2 closest to the Knob, go to the Headlights.Note: There is NO HIGH BEAM option. unless mabey you can hookup your headlights to the Running Lights Ports,and run a relay for the High Beams to the screws closest to the Knob, mabey???---- UPDATE ----OK, I posted a Picture of How to wire it up.You're Welcome.The seller should've done it, but we cant rely on them for that, apparently....

They work, but they can look funky on curved surfaces. (see pic) I can't recommend these unless you are placing them on a perfectly flat surface. Cars generally do not have very many perfectly flat surfaces. I spent money trying to get some sort of filler material to take up the gap at the front and back but it was an exercise in frustration. They will work well on a truck and trailer, which is probably what they were designed for. So if that is what you are going to use them, I say 100% good idea and they will work great. But for those who want to use them on your car and want it to look nice, you will be disappointed.

The pictures show the outter floods as blue. Why? I have no idea. However. This light bar is all bright white and works flawlessly. I installed this in conjunction with Rough Country roof mount brackets and it all bolted together flawlessly. Light is super bright. So far no issues with moisture inside. Super easy to wire. Ive bought many led lights on amazon and this is by far the best deal so far. I would love the chance to review other lights from this seller. Thsnks for an awsome product ant an amazing price.

At first glance it looks to be well built and the mounting holes line up correctly. After removing the old latch assembly it becomes obvious there is a part missing. I have a Lowes Kobalt tool box and the rod connector is riveted on. This latch and most others use a bolt through type of rod connector. Just beware and check to see if the rod connector is removable and reusable. I will update after I receive the rod connector, it is not available locally or through Amazon.After paying $6.00 for a $2.00 rod connector the latch is now in. The only problem is the old right hand latch and the new latch do not want to play nice together. The old latch reaches full open before the new one and causes the box to be hard to open. I guess I will have to buy a new latch for the right side!

Bought for my 2008 Dodge Ram 1500. Install took roughly 40 minutes. I went out and bought some self tapping hex head bolts to help attach permanently to OE pedals. Brake pedal was cake to install, but accelerator pedal, being curved and plastic, was a pain. Eventually was able to get a bracket to tighten down with the curve of pedal, and then put a couple of the bolts through each one. The bolt heads fix perfectly within the holes of the pedal, and color matched very nicely. I liked the look personally, so it all works out fine.

This mount works great and easy install on a JK. I think I will try the brackets that come with so that I can still put the windshield down.A quick review on the parts I used and hopefully tips if you are taking on this fairly easy install. I did need some extra wire for the wiring harness to reach the A post. Check out the videos for install help if this is your first time. It was for me. I hooked the rocker switch to the dash lights, had to remove most of the dash to get this done but looks really good and the light dims with the dash lights. See this video:[...] Well worth the time in my opinion.Parts list for JK 2016:Nilight 2 X 18W 1260 lm Cree LEDLink: http://amzn.com/B00G620ZVUOpar Lower Windshield Light MountsLink: http://amzn.com/B015XTXY1YROCKER SWITCH_SPOT LIGHTS BLUELink: http://amzn.com/B00QYIZ890Rugged Ridge 17235.58 Black Left Side A-Pillar 4-Switch PodLink: http://amzn.com/B009X23B2UIn review, all of these parts worked very well but a few small negatives. Make sure to have a little extra wire handy. The rocker switch that comes with the wiring harness can be replaced as a unit easily but not just the face plate. I found that Otrattw switches are more customizable and are a very good quality. They can also be designed in landscape so that they look better in the pillar.Hopefully this is helpful!

Perfect fit for my '06 Civic Si Coupe. The stock intake was a PAIN to remove, but once that's out of the way, installing this didn't take long. Took me about 5 hours by myself, after a bit of struggling with getting some of the nuts/bolts loose.Sounds great, legal, and requires little maintenance, couldn't have asked for more.

Frame is put together well, but that is where the quality ended.  The engine is terrible.  The packaging of the oil container left oil leaking everywhere after shipping, and once you put oil into the engine and get it running, it has issues staying running for long enough to break it in.  Once you do get to that point, check for oil leaks as soon as you attempt to ride it.  The one I got leaked oil terribly bad, started smoking from hot oil slinging from tire onto exhaust, and left oil on our driveway.  I didn't have it for a couple hours and I'm sending it back for another product.  Sad because this has such good promise for convenience.

Purchased this as a replacement for my wife's 2004 VW Beetle.  The original lasted about 14 years before pieces of the plastic began flaking off (I have no idea why VW would make this out of plastic).  This item is identical to the original part, and hopefully it will last another 12+ years.

these leveled my 2014 ram 1500 perfectly.  I had 2.75in of factory rake.  set the bilsteins at 2.8 and it perfectly leveled my truck.  my cv joints have only the slightest bit of an angle. no thuds,  creaks, or vibrations in 4WD. Ride is a little stiffer, sportier, but that is to be expected from the extra compression of the coil. i chose to install these myself.  Watched the youtube video that everyone has and it went fairly smooth.  i have about 26000 miles on my truck.  all nuts and bolts were fairly easy to remove.  impact wrench is your best friend here. except the upper ball joint. the nut came off fine.  I had to beat the sense out of those and apply heat to get those to pop loose.  also had a lot more difficulty pulling the whole coil over assembly out of the wheel well.  video made that part seem easy.  had no issues compressing the spring and putting the bilsteins in.  I made sure the included washer was installed under the coil over top plate.  then the included nut over the plate.  tightening down the nut was a bit of a pain.  had to use a hex key and 13/16" socket to tighten that down.  It is VERY,VERY IMPORTANT, that the washer goes under the top plate on the bilsteins piston.  The included instructions show this.  If you don't there is potential for the shock piston to bust through the shock tower mount.  that's no good.  also want to make sure the circlip is seated properly in the groove of shock. it should spin fairly easily around the groove if seated properly.  if not this could also cause problems. also need to make sure the spring seat adapter is on the shock right.  i included a pic to show proper orientation.  I'm pretty handy and have never done strut work before.  Its really just undoing and redoing some nuts and bolts with the exception of compressing the spring.  I also cant stress this enough,  COMPRESSING SPRINGS IS DANGEROUS!!!!  there is a lot of stored energy in the springs.  Life altering energy!!!  If you are not comfortable with that,  have the professionals install them.  I just had the tools and wanted to save a few hundred bucks. You will need an alignment after the install.  i chose to put about 150 miles on it.  let everything settle a bit,  re-torque all the nuts and bolts,  then went in for the alignment. I've included multiple pics as well as before and after.  definitely worth the money and effort i put into it.  truck looks so much meaner!!!

This ball joint removal tool in injunction with the Jeep service adapter accessory made what is usually a difficult and time consuming job EASY PEASY!This unit is really beefy and doesn't bend or distort under load.  It simply owns the ball joints and pushes them right out.In my circumstance I also bought the Jeep service adapters which fitted my 2013 JKUR perfectly.  The Jeep service adapter took all the guess work out of the job and made it really safe.Sometimes when you don't have exact service adapters that fit the ball joits perfectly you have to make due and sometimes you have slop.  Under  pressure stacked adapters can shift and come apart and under pressure can launch a hunk of metal like a projectile.  The Jeep service adapter took all the risk out of the job and made it super easy to do.  I really thought this was going to be a nightmare job but that couldn't have been further from the truth.I highly recommend getting the specific service adapters for your vehicle if they make them.  It made my job safe and EASY PEASY!OTC (7894) Jeep/Dodge Ball Joint Service Adapter https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002SRGW0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_wCV1ybSC8ZCCJ

These are great.  They need to update the advertisement though.  These do support the 2017 trucks.  These are the latest model iBoards by APS -- probably rebranded just in this ad so as to not compete with other sellers.  But they come in an iBoard box with an iBoard Part number -- IB-D6208A -- Which is the latest and best for the 1500 / 2500 / 3500 CREW CAB trucks.  These have the latest mounting brackets and tracks in the bottom so you can slide the boards forward and back to suit the positioning that you like.The installation was easy.  All the parts were there.  It took me exactly 2 hours taking my time.  The finish on the aluminum was not as good as I like it so I polished them.  They look great.  The rubber on the topside is fantastic.  These are extremely sturdy.

OMG these are bright! I tried so many different sizes and styles of lights off Amazon and non were up to par. Most lacked the quality of build or brightness of lights. They are even brighter than at least 3 different light bars I tried out from Amazon, and all three went back for one issue or another. These are made of quality material and you can feel the heftyness of them and quality in your hands. I got the 8" styles in Black mounted on a JKU 75th Anniversary Bumper under a Maximus-3 Classic Hoop bar and they look nice. They actually measure about 7.75" or so and I was actually hoping to get them in 7" but I like this style better than their 7" versions.I'd buy again... I did have to return one and swap it for a new one because the packaging came damaged on one other the lights and the mounting bracket was bent on arrival. Not the manufacturer's fault but a shipping issue.

Great product, I just leave it on the 18 lit mode for brighter effect. The provided 3M double sided foam tape does not stick to a lot of rubber surfaces in my car, (2015 Si), had to use Automotive 3M molding tape. Used the same double side tape (not included) to do the front and Velcro Tape (plastic side, also not included) to stick under the front seats for the rear passengers. Product itself was great, but I wish they had used less wiring for the two wires for the front and kept the two longer wires for the rear or trunk.

Fantastic product!  A little heavy on the wallet but it's weighed out by buying from an American company using American materials.  These fit my 2004 Ford Ranger Edge 4x4 4.0L very well.  They almost look integral.  My model doesn't have carpeting so there is no retainer clip so I can't say how it lines up with other models.  Would definitely purchase again.

Fit's 2015 Trailhawk. I use it to carry sailboards, windsurfers. These are about as solid as you get. The locks are superfluous and needless. You need a 5mm hex key to open these and remove from the rail. I seriously doubt some punk is going to take 20mins to unbolt these from your rack "if he even has a 5mm hex key" in the bag??The locks are essentially a thin plastic cover. When you use your key it rotates a plastic cover over the hex key hole, ostensibly "obscuring" it. Hardly sophisticated. While being a total joke, it's easy to take a drill and simply hole the covers. Trust, no thief want's your bbq or generic racks. Plus these are so beefy and well made ripping them off is not an option. Soft and durable rubber covers your rails, very plush. Use the supplied rubber track strip to alay wind noise. I first fit the racks, then used a marker to witness where I would have to cut the generous strips of seal you are supplied. Removed the racks, then cut to fit. Easy Peasy. Please use common sense and secure your kayak,surfboard, 2x4s or whatever your hauling not TO YOUR RACK, but to your ROOF RAIL. That's right. The crossbars support the weight and straps secure to the cross RAILS. Never tie the end of you strap to the BARS always the rails. There one guy that posted on here and he lost his Kayak. Honesty he was probably speeding into a headwind and simply forgot. His pictures  clearly show he had items with the aerodynamics of a Air Craft Carrier secured to $100 bars. These will work.

I put these on my customized golf cart. They are super bright and hardly use any of the battery. Very happy with them, in fact I am going to buy another pair for the rear of the cart.

Very loud and sensitive. just be sure to use a hole in the disc, so the sensor (which is near the lock pin) is covered by the disc and not over an empty space. In my CBR1000RR 2005, take a bit of effort to store it under the passenger seat, and is better to leave the lock unlocked there to avoid false activation while riding.

Great service from Falls Mopar City. Arrived well packed and quickly.The install is quick and simple. I laid a strip of blue tape and used an old credit card and a SAMs club card as tools. there's two tabs, look at new parts to figure out where the tabs are.  Slid the cards in at a pretty steep angle and listen for a click or pop. Leave the card in place and gently lift on the part. It should come up and out easy. Slide the new scoops in making sure the top is seated and push the bottom clips in til they click and lock. Simple. Open the hood and pull the boots into position in the inner skin of the hood structure. Clean up and done.

Fit very well. Look very nice. From a distance they look like rims but close up you can easily tell they are not. The painted areas aren't as "clean" as they could or should be but for The price they are fine.

They fit but, Man oh man these mats stink. I have to drive with the windows down. I'm going to try washing them. I hope that works. I will keep you updated.These are not Heavy Duty. They are thin. I know they are not going to last long at all. I guess you get what you pay for. $20 is not high quality or heavy duty..

Super easy to install. You need to drill two 1 1/2" holes in the panel you intend to mount this in. No instructions were provided but the volt meter and USB device terminals were marked + & -. Ignore the color of the terminals, they don't match the + & - markings. Each dvice must be wired separately.  The USB device extends 2" behind the panel. The voltmeter extends 1". Each item can rotate in the mounting bezel so both vertical or horizontal installation is possible. There is a blue LED indicating that the USB is powered. The voltmeter display is bright blue. I tried charging both an iPhone and iPad. Both accepted the source.

I finally got around to looking at it and found the OEM sway bar links were shot (most of the bushings were gone).I saw these here for cheap and figured for the price I would give them a try (I got this as an "add on item", about 1/3 of the regular price).They appear to be the same as the higher priced ones, except with black bushings vs blue or red (which I actually like, since they don't stick out beng black) . Mine are polyurethane, not sure how they compare to the other higher priced ones, but can't be any worse than the OEM rubber ones.Installation was simple. Old ones came off easily (I know many say theirs are broken). Little trick to putting them on if they seem too short.Take both old ones off, install 1 side loosely with the bottom bushing off (but with washer) and then put the other side on completely but still loose, then take the nut and washer back off the other side and put the 4th bushing on with washer and nut and tighten. I think the spec is 30 ft lbs, but I did it till it was tight and the bushings were starting to bulge some. I will check them in a few weeks to see how they are doing.After finishing it, I went for a drive. Much, much quieter and handling/steering felt better since I finally had a connected swaybar.I will post back if any issues with them.***********************************************************************Edit: Well, after about 1 year, one of the bushings has split. It is not rattling yet and has not fallen off, but still. Only 7000 miles since replacement and it is already showing signs of failure. Not impressed. Maybe I just need to get some Moog ones. Not crazy about the blue they are, but I know they will last.***********************************************************************Edit again: well, I am now at over 2 years/14,000 miles with these and the split mentioned above has not gotten any worse in the past year and these are still working. Still not happy with them splitting like they did, but they are still working.

Everything came on time and packaged nicely. Took me all of 7 minutes to install on the 2011 Chevy Cruze once unpackaged. Looks of good quality although the screws to hold it on are plastic which of course I am somewhat concerned about the longevityof the fasteners but I guess time will tell.

Dorman 697-706: installed on a 2006, GMC Sierra 1500, 5.3L, 2 W/D,and equipped with a towing package and thus has  Posi Traction.For your info:- Heavy duty, high quality product.- Fit like a glove, including top cut-outs for brake lines.- Fill-hole (NO, it's NOT a drainage hole!!!) is very practical and much more accessible for filling purposes.- Gasket that was supplied was EXCELLENT and better than Felpro.- Bung did NOT leak and comes with a heavy duty nylon washer. Yes, you have to tighten it after filling...I thought that was obvious!  ; )- I primed it and painted it.  It is made out of heavy duty steel...but it will rust.- I used 75W90 synthetic oil because I have better things to do in life and do not enjoy crawling under trucks.- Take your time...and CLEAN all surfaces....no room for error here!!- I applied gasket sealer on BOTH sides of the gasket and have zero, nada, niente, keine..... LEAKS!- I torqued all 10 bolts to 10-20, and then 30 Foot/Pounds. Don't be a dork....TORQUE !!It's the only way to go if everything is rusty and the removal of the original fill-plug is doubtful !EXCELLENT PRODUCT.....enough said !

After using these Champion hybrid wipers on my 2007 Prius for 5 days in moderately heavy rain, drizzle, and sun with the washer spray I'm very pleased.I was amused at putting hybrid wipers on my hybrid Prius. Apparently there are two major wiper designs and these are supposed to incorporate design elements of both to get a superior result. In my case they work as well as any wiper I've put on my car. Better? Maybe.The wipers come in packaging common for many wiper brands - a long plastic "eye shaped" tube. The rubber blade has a blue slide-off plastic protector which I think is a nice touch. A clip is included if it is needed. The clip fit my Prius wiper arm but was NOT needed to mount the wipers securely. I had a few moments of frustration mounting them because of this. They would not mount *with* the clip but were easy to put on securely without it. At least once I figured that out. The picture based directions on the package could have been much better.My car is a 2007 Prius and before these I had one Rain-X wiper (chattered badly in very cold weather but otherwise nice) and a Bosh winter blade (did a great job on my passenger side last winter). Now I have a matched set. Nice!The windshield of my Prius is in pretty good shape for a 9 year old car: no noticeable pitting or obvious wear. Windshield condition makes a difference in wiper performance and especially how fast they wear out.Since getting these wipers we have had a variety of rain and some gusty winds here in New England. This ranged from moderately heavy rain to drizzle. In all rain conditions the Champion wipers performed perfectly with consistent full contact from stopped to full highway speeds. They efficiently removed lots of water and drizzle drops and didn't streak or have any other issues. In sunny weather I used my washer fluid  and they worked perfectly again. I use&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rain-X-washer-fluid/dp/B003VOF6A6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rain-X washer fluid</a>&nbsp;which really like. As I've only had them for 5 days I can't say how long they will last.In conclusion I am very pleased with my new Champion hybrid wipers on my hybrid car :-) They maintain full contact and in all conditions (so far) they keep my windshield clear and streak-free. Installation was quick and easy once I knew I didn't need the extra clip. The instructions on the package could stand some improvement.Windshield wipers are a safety item. When you need them, you need them to work well. These Champion hybrid wiper blades are working very well for me and get 5 stars.Hope this helps someone.

I was pleasantly surprised to find this $39 cover for sale on amazon. After installing it (took 10 minutes, very easy) I can honestly say I'm impressed. It looks great and was a great fit. There shouldn't be any noticable sagging (if you have some your doing it wrong) you can stretch it out from the mounting points to tighten it up. The only noticeable crease was from where it was folded in the packaging for too long, this will work itself out though over time as it sits in the heat and conforms to the shape of the tank better. Uploaded pics, for $39 it sure beats the heck out of those cheap-o stick on pads.

Purchased from summit racing because it was out of stock on Amazon.If your looking for a moderately aggressive exhaust this is the one for you. The is no drone just light aggressive deep tone, basically enough to know its there when generally accelerating and when you push on it it growls nicely! Overall very impressed, for the price I would buy a second just in case trail riding messed it up!I have attached a photo with numbers describing somethings. The photo is as it looks for a 05-15 Tacoma.#1 and the only issue I had if you would call it that. The hanger position is wrong, it's in the right area but like other reviews I saw before purchasing you have to put some vise grips on the hanger end portion and turn it so that it will be parallel with the hanger rubber piece. Again no big deal you do not need to heat the steal it's not cheap metal although some heat would do it better more or less for assurance.#2 It took me a couple hours to install because I had to cut 13 inches of the straight portion of pipe because I don't have a 6 foot bed but a 5 foot. The kit includes everything needed but the means of sizing down the pipe so go to your local exhaust or complete repair shop and they will cut the 13" off at no charge or at least they didn't charge me.All together it's a sold kit and if your on the fence pull the trigger this is a good product! Other complaints would be on the packaging I receive this product in rather rough shaped box but nothing was damaged. Again this was purchased directly from summit racing but is the same product!

How do these $32.99 JDM ASTAR Extremely Bright 3030 Chipsets differ from the (white-colored base) JDM ASTAR Extremely Bright PX Chipsets White/Yellow Switchback LED Bulbs for $29.99?Basically these units produce a little more "bright white light" than the alternative $29.99 Switchback LEDs do, and a little less "amber light" in flashing mode, at least in the Spec-D Headlights that I'm running in my Chevy Impala (see attached).The inverse is true for the $29.99 JDM ASTAR Extremely Bright PX Chipsets (white-colored base) LEDs--they produce more "amber light" and a little less "bright white light".Still, both Switchback LEDs look terrific, and I think most people would be happy with either choice.For my purposes, the slightly brighter amber light is more important to me, though indeed both LEDs add noticeably more light onto the road and the road signs.These LEDs did not fit the 3757 (PY27) bulb sockets in my Spec-D Headlights without significant modification to the bulb sockets and a little to the LED bases themselves.  It was a considerable hassle, figuring all this out...NOTE:  An ill-fitting LED could lead to a serious accident or even death, in a system where you've added resistors to cancel the hyper-flash that serves to warn you that a signal bulb may be burned out.  Make sure your LED lamps fit tightly into your bulb sockets.Now, let's see how long these last...RayB

I used this on my 1975 Plymouth Duster. I first washed it, then used a clay bar, followed by a light polish.  After polishing, I used this product, applying it with a good buffer using a blue Hex Logic pad. I was really impressed with how easy this went on and came off. I don't think any other product I have used wiped off so easily! I followed it up with a quality wax.  I love this product, and would definitely buy it again. It is worth the price.

I just received the battery today and so far I am very impressed. The battery arrived at just over 13 V and under load it tested at a whopping 1200 CCAs (see pics).  The battery in my pick up truck doesnt even test with cranking amps this high. All this and according to my charger its not even 80% charged yet!  Something else I liked is that the terminals are threaded, so theres no fumbling with trying to get a matching nut threaded inside of the post.Just a couple of other observations, the terminals are not made out of lead, but instead look like there are stainless or nickel. Because of the size, smoothness and hardness its a little harder to get the charge clamps to stay on, but no big deal for me since I use a battery tender thats wired in.  I included a side-by-side picture with the battery Im replacing from my 2005 Polaris sportsman 700 EFI.

I used these to replace my factory springs on my 02 suburban with the Nivomat shocks.  I chose to upgrade springs & use a good quality conventional shock.  I am very pleased with the upgrade.  My factory Nivomat shocks were wore out.  My suburban has 155k miles & pulls a 30' camper regularly.  These springs lifted the rear of my vehicle back up.  It now stands 2" taller in the rear & rides great.  Handling has greatly improved also.  I installed monroe reflex shocks all the way around too.  I highly recommend this spring /shock set up.  I'm very happy with mine.

I used these to replace the vanity mirror lights in my Jeep.  Out of box, 4 for 4 in regards to functionality.  This is an easy swap of the original bulbs to get rid of that dingy yellow from the incandescent bulbs.  One word of advice though, these things are bright so I suggest not looking directly at them for too long. My lights power on automatically when the cover is opened so I had no option to disable them, as soon as I popped these suckers in, I got blinded. During normal use however, they're much better for overall visibility.

Quality appears to be very good, my only dilemma is how do you tell the difference between a Lt side, RS999913 and a Rt side, RS999914? They both arrived quick enough but between work and the weather I had to wait a short while to do the swap out on my 07 FJ TRD Ed., but after I pulled my original struts and was ready to put in the new ones I can't tell between the two new struts, they're not labeled 13 or 14 from what I can see... There are visible differences on the old struts between the lt and rt sides, the left OEM strut end of coil at the bottom ends on the right side and the rt side OEM strut end of coil at the bottom ends on the left side... the new struts look exactly alike, the coils both end on the left side with the knobs facing you... (I suspect I received 2 of the same, I emailed Rancho but especially on Labor Day weekend there's no one to be reached) Can someone tell me the differences, there must be something for the Lt and Rt sides to have unique part numbers? End of day, now I'm forced to put all the OEM parts back in, not a happy camper... For now, I've got to lower the rating for inadequate labeling of individual units, I'll change it if needed when I'm aware of unknown markings...

When I opened the box, right away I could tell something was wrong. one of the packages had Scotch tape holding it together. Then I look at the "Plug and Play load equalizer and the plug had been cut off. I sent them four pictures that clearly show they sent my a piece of junk I asked them to send me a new one and their answer is as follows: I went ahead and got a pre-paid shipping label into processing for you. This label will be sent to your e-mail within two business days. We ask that you print it out and affix it to your package so you can send that back to us at no additional cost.

I got this light to replace a similar one already on my bike. The one I have now is an old Model "A" light, and is not very bright. You can't see my tail light at all in the daylight, and can barely see the brake light. My bike already has a bracket mounted on side of the rear tire for the plate, and holds the tail light above it. My intentions are to reuse that same bracket if I can, with this light. I tested this light on a 12V power supply and it seems quite a lot brighter than what I have on the bike now, and the brake light is noticeably brighter than the tail light. Perfect! There's a small clear area in the bottom of the lens for lighting the plate, which we require in my state, so it's nice that it's there. The metal bracket included is nice, plenty strong for holding a plate and the light. The light itself is plastic, with the rear portion black rubber material. The light socket inside is not the best quality, but should get the job done as long as you don't abuse it. Another reviewer mentioned breaking the socket when changing bulbs. I recommend pushing the socket out of the rubber molding so you can grab the metal socket itself when changing bulbs, it will make it much easier. Overall I'm happy with the light, and it should work for my needs. It's not the best quality light out there by a long shot, but it is a heck of a lot cheaper than most! I feel you get your money's worth and then some. I did get this one at a discount for evaluation and review, but that doesn't influence my rating or review here. I appreciate a good honest review from other shoppers here at Amazon and always do my best to give the same in return. Hope this helps! (If you'd like to see a picture installed on my bike, comment here and I'll remember to get one, I should have it mounted in a week or so when I get time.)

Antenna is really nice quality. I'm impressed with the reception of even distant stations. It's a really nice antenna and it does what I wanted. I used SiriusXM almost exclusively and the long factory antenna was unnecessary and unsightly. As a side note, I could have done without the "#420" pot reference on the business card enclosed with the product.

Not as bright at my name brand bar that was stolen but needed it quick for a road trip it works very well. Two days after installing it I hit a antelope in Wyoming driving from Alaska to Texas, the light bar took a huge hit pushed back through the grille and ac condenser but didn't crack and still works great. Proper aiming is key to get the most output I have it relayed off my high beams on my trailblazer I love it.

As a detailer, this is perhaps the most time-saving item I have of all the equipment and products I use. I didn't know how long it lasted until I purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Nanoskin-AS-019-AutoScrub-Fine-Grade-Sponge/dp/B00CUAWJ6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nanoskin (AS-019) AutoScrub Fine Grade Sponge</a>&nbsp;for smaller sections that the pad couldn't reach (i.e. door handles, carrier racks, trim).There were a few differences between the old and new pad. I've included a few pics to show the small differences. There is a little bit of a tackier feel to the new pad even though I could probably still get 2-3 cars from the old pad. I always wondered how long the pad would last and I'd say I have done approx. 25-30 cars and trucks before pad "needed" to be replaced. I use Garry Dean's Infinite Use Detail juice since it's cheaper when diluted compared to most other lubricating products.I got tired of just putting wax on cars since they still felt rough even after they were detailed. Most people don't realize what a difference clay makes. The surface is so much smoother, which makes it easier to apply polish/wax/sealant. If you have a DA buffer I highly recommend this pad. I know some people say it leaves swirls, but I haven't noticed any. I don't think the medium grade pad is necessary for most vehicles. Use some sort of lubricant and DON'T apply it to hot paint or in direct sunlight! It will stick to the car and leave residue on the paint.

Rear brake rotor for acura TL,this is a disc brake rotor with internal drum emergency brake. One rotor I found that the emergency brake surface had not been machined to remove the black e-coating. The other rotor was fine. I had to sand the paint off the internal emergency brake surface to finish the job. I should have returned it but I needed to finish the job.

I purchased these bulbs for an alternative to HID/LED kits. Since I couldn't get an LED bulb for DRLs without loosing myHigh beams I went with what you see on my2012 Honda OdysseyPic 1 is with DRLs On. Passengerside is sylvania and driverside is OEM. Not much difference....Pic 2 is with the HI beans On. It clearly shows the difference next to my HIDs 6K.Personally not what I wanted as for the outcome but, they are whiter than OEM and they are brighter. For the price it is not really worth it if you are looking for something closer to the HID look.

Let me start off by saying that I have a vehicle that will charge all my devices even if the car is off. SOMETIMES that is great, but other times I get scared because I forget to unplug things. It is a constant running joke in my house how one day i will be stuck somewhere because I needed to charge my phone. *I* don't think it's funny, but everyone else does. Sigh.As soon as I got this I immediately started charging it. The power bank is sleek and I love the way it isn't super massive. It ddn't take long for it to be fully charged which suprised me for all that it is said to do!I googled and read reviews on how to hook it up to my car without shocking myself or blowing up my car, in my defense I have NEVER done this before and I did NOT want to ask for help from anyone. I went to my car and hooked it up successfuly and I now know how to save myself from a ridiculous amount of ridicule and NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW MY CAR DIED.The fact that it comes with a set of charger cables for EVERY DEVICE on the market is also a HUGE bonus for me. So from Apple to Android, ALL of them, to handheld gaming devices and it can charge my Samsung Galaxy Camera? WHILE being able to jump start my car? YES. And the car charger that this set comes with to charge the power bank that will charge pretty much everything in the world, ok, in MY world, and it has a LED luminance system, an SOS signal, a super bright flash light, a built in redundant electronic control safety system, AND it tells me when the power bank is low? I cannot say how much in love with this I am... There are just no words.This kit comes with everything needed for someone who is always on the go, or even an outdoors person who (needs) likes to have access to the outside world (me) while camping and other activities! I am so glad that I have this, it will stay forever in my vehicle, I really do feel better having it!I revieved this product at a discounted rate for an honest review. And my honest review is THIS set is a must have for anyone with any type of vehicle!

[Update 4/3/2016] I went on a road trip and test this to be sure it would work...well flashlight went dead. I only used this 4 times since 2015 and left it in the box and car since. still had 3 led light for charge but still if you don't use the flashlight it die? Knocking one star down for that.[Update 4/8/2016] Spoke with Anker CS and they would send me a replacement after almost a year without question! Love Anker and their CS!! Back to 5 stars!--------------------------------------------------------------------It works!I bought this because my car is in the garage and not being uses so the battery tend to die out if I don't cold start it once in a while.My Car:2008 Lexus IS250 2.5LI followed the instruction and waited until the light on the black clamp is green.First try I put the clamps on and automatically my alarm blew up! I was like WOW that's pretty fast. Then I entered my car and see all the ceiling lights on and my odometer powered up. Started my car and like that it worked!Second time it worked the same!Overall: Definitely recommend this! It's small, portable, comes with a travel case and IT WORKED!!!

I seek items that stand out which is why I didn't hesitate when I saw this sunshade. It's been 100+ degrees the past few days so I desperately needed some coverage for my vehicle. After searching amazon for a unique product, I found this baby. It does a good job of keeping your car cool. I'm glad I bought it and highly recommend this sunshade to everyone

2008 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited X (jk), 6cyl.Although the bumper looked like it was shipped by an angry gorilla it was shockingly undamaged. Installation was simple and the bolt pattern was spot on.  Welds looked good all around. My fog lights also bolted up nicely. My only complaint was that the aux light flanges on the top bar were not square to the bar.

Very complete kit that even included a pair of leather gloves.  The winch mounted easily and looks great.  The motor is smooth and quiet.  The kit is complete with all hardware and components needed in the box.  I did notice a parasitic load on the battery so I added a cut off switch ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078KN3H7Q/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ) to eliminate battery drain when not in use.  The wireless remote control already had batteries installed.  All components appear to be good quality and as I stated earlier looks great!  Recommend.

I only received the front set so far, and the rear is on backorder.  As of now, this review is for the front set only.  I purchased from my dealership because I had a 50% off coupon for using the Costco Auto Buying Program, so it was just cheaper there.I couldn't be more happy with my Weathertech floor mats (front set).  I purchased a similar off-brand set for my last truck, and when I bought my new truck, I knew I had to buy these.  The Weathertech system fits perfectly and offers so much more coverage than my stock mats.  It even protects the carpet on the hump in case someone has to sit up front in the middle.  I installed them when it was cold, so they haven't fully settled perfectly yet, but even still, it looks great along my floor and around my seats.  I'm sure that the fit will get even better after I've run my heater or when the weather gets a bit warmer.  The mats cover all the way up under my pedals, as high as the factory carpet goes, and they snap into the factory posts so they will stay in place.I would definitely recommend these to anyone wanting floor protection in their vehicle.  I have uploaded photos so that you can see.  A couple of them even show my stock mats thrown on top so that you can compare the coverage.  A picture is worth a thousand words, or in this case, 5 STARS!

This is a great OEM replacement kit that includes everything you need to complete the fuel filter job. I couldn't believe how much money the dealer wanted to charge to change the fuel filter, I really feel like dealers or mechanics in general often times take advantage of people who don't realise how easy some of the routine maintenance is to do. Just buying the parts was about 1/3rd the cost of having the dealer do this for me. And when you realize you have to do this job every 15,000 miles, wow it's just better to learn how to do this on your own yourself.**One word of caution for install** For the white filter that goes just below the driver's door near the transfercase... You can use a huge socket to pull the part off, but you're working with plastic, I think it's like a 33mm or something huge! However I would highly recommend using a strap wrench so you don't bust the plastic part holding the inner filter.There are two Fuel filters for the 2011 and up F250, one is below the driver's door down on the undercarriage of the vehicle and the other is in the hood toward the fire wall on the driver's side. On the filter below, make sure you drain the diesel fuel out of the filter by using the yellow twist knob. Then remove the sensor cables connection to the filter housing, using your strap wrench remove the fuel filter housing, make sure you keep something to catch diesel as there is going to be more diesel to fall out. When you replace the filter, take a look at how the old one sits so you can make sure you install correctly, but the open end should face up. Don't forget to replace the gasket on the male connector up on the truck before screwing the new filter back in place.The front filter is quite a bit easier. Locate it under the hood, it will look like the black filter with the two hose connectors one in and the other out. *Note* your truck's filter might have three things coming off, the third one is a factor fill nipple, and the replacement won't have that, that is one way to know if your fuel filter has ever been changed from the factory if it has two or three outlets. Remove the hoses and then use a 7mm socket wrench to loosen the clamp around the filter, twist to the right until it stops then pull upwards, and install following the same steps in reverse order.

Floor jack fit's perfectly under my fianc lowered G37, and also works well for my Yukon. Picked it up at local harbor freight and I suggest buying the 2 year warranty. About 5 months of use the welds on the bottom of the pole broke. It being outside the 90 day warranty, the 2 year warranty was very worth it. If the handle ever comes out while jack is lifted use a 5/8 socket and ratchet to lower it.

So far so good. I used these in conjunction with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Lamin-x-S108Y-Fog-Light-Cover/dp/B006FXFOP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Lamin-x S108Y Fog Light Cover</a>&nbsp;and the end result is a very deep yellow, just what I was looking for. I generally only use my fog lights when needed, so I'm hoping I can get some longevity from the bulbs, but for the price, you really can't beat them for Hella quality.UPDATE: Within 2 weeks I had one lamp burn out. I am returning them. Shame, because I really liked the deep color I got when combined with the overlays.

Cheaply made. It worked great the first time but the 2nd time it wasn't holding a suction. I tried changing the valve stem which didn't help. I added grease to seal it, that didn't work. I opened it up and it looks like a gasket of some sort crumbled into pieces. I want my money back.

These things give off a pretty wide pattern for being so small. they could be a tad bit brighter but they are a fog light which is exactly what i needed. Lights feel well made and sturdy. The wiring harness is very well made. Wire is of good quality and is fairly long however, the load wire that goes from the switch to the relay was not long enough and needed to be extended for my needs. The switch that comes with the kit is really nice and has an LED active light thats red when the lights are off and greeen when the lights are turned on, but i won't be using it.EDIT: CRAP! lights started to leak. seems like the weather stripping inside around the lens is way too big and doesnt seal right. took the lights off my front bumper and put them on my rear bumper to use as reverse lights since they didn't give me the light output desired. after almost of week of being on my rear bumper they filled up completely with water even worse than they did on my front bumper and one lens also cracked. going to contact the company or seller to see if i can get a replacement lens. READ ALL REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING. THESE LIGHTS ARE NOT THE GREATEST.

I modified a few things to make the Tusk moto lift stand work well for my needs, but what I bought saved me that much money's worth of time.The lock nut for the height adjustment doesn't stay locked, so I ditched it and drilled / tapped for a set screw - good to go!I cross-drilled the handle receiver and handle for a pin, so the handle stays in unless I want it out - personal preference.Everything else about it is decent to good.  For the money, I give it 5 stars.

There is nothing quite like getting a great price on an OEM part. Zero complaints from me. It fit perfectly on my 2005 F150 5.4L Triton, as one would expect. I've attached a comparison between my old and new filter. Honestly I did think that old one was all that bad, until I saw it next to the new one. UGH

The beveled edges on the backside don't fit too well with the curve on the inside of the handle so there will either be a space between the handle and the insert or they will stick out the end if you push them flush against the handle.Edit: two stars to one starOnly been on the Jeep a couple months during the winter and they're corroding. This is a major design flaw on their part. You can't have Aluminum contacting stainless steel because it will initiate galvanic corrosion. I noticed during installation that the casting for the drill holes wasn't perfect so you would have to screw through the paint to get the screw to go through the hole...making a contact point. Didn't think anything of it at the time, now they look like garbage.  Looks like garbage now and I am hoping for a refund or replacement with proper screws. I will update with pictures and end results.

This HUD works pretty well. I tried it on several vehicles and had varying levels of success getting it to work. It worked great on the ones that were newer than 2004 like the description says, but not so much on older vehicles (2002). So make sure you are buying this for a 2004+ vehicle. At first I just plugged in the device and had it reflecting on the windshield without the reflector that came in the box. This worked but there was a distinct double image that happened. Once I applied the reflector panel, the double image went away and the brightness of the display increased quite a bit. In my pictures, you can see the difference as well as the visibility even when I used the flash on my phone. I did have to go through the menu and calibrate the device once for it to start showing the information, otherwise it seemed to only show me the voltage. But once I went through the menu it showed my speed and other information as well. It is super easy to hook up, just plug the cable into your OBD2 port and the other end into the device. It comes with an anti slide pad to put between the HUD and your dash and well as a reflector panel to place on your windshield. The reflector panel is noticeable, but looking through it does not bother me very much and does not impair my view of the road. The directions are a bit hard to understand, but if you read through everything once or twice you should be able to figure out what it is saying. The cable had a nice amount of length to it, and I had no trouble reaching the spot that I wanted to try this HUD out. Overall, I am very pleased with this device.Disclosure: I have received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review, but that fact has not influenced my opinion about the product. I was not required to write a positive review and no monetary compensation was received for writing reviews.

This Winomo door panel and trim removal tool set is nicely made. The set includes six different tools, five of which are made from a durable heavy duty, non-marring red plastic. One of the tools has a steel shank with a claw that works well for things like popping metal spring type door panel clips out of their holes.  The tools all seem to be of good quality and are working quite well for my needs, so I would definitely recommend them to anyone that routinely installs things like car stereos, speakers or alarm wiring.

Easy install, great results.  This is fits my '04 Wrangler perfectly.  I had a 4" crack in my intake tube that caused an annoying whistling sound and also could have got dust and dirt in my intake.  Once installed not much change in sound but a really nice change in acceleration.  Plus it was nice getting the "old whistler" filter box out of there.Make sure you have deep well metric sockets and a 6" extension.  I believe everything was 10mm except the bolt for the heat shield.  It was 13mm if I remember right.  Also when you start to take out the filter box there are nuts on the bottom side, so you may need a back up wrench.

I purchased the 16-28" size in the 'single bar' selection (listed to be a 3 pack in the title, photo, and description) and received the 3 pack as advertised.Uploading a photo with the instructions. Set-up takes about ten seconds and is very easy. Using one vertically, inside a cabinet, as a divider to hold our cutting boards up...Not strong enough to hang horizontally under the sink and hang spray bottles from (without adding mounts to stabilize it) but perfect for our use.This product is made in China. We've not had them too long but the springs seem strong. I'll update this review if they don't last. Smile. Hope this is helpful!

Great product. I was able to use the old screws. Easy installation. A little tip, use a jack to raise the tires off the ground and turn the wheels; this will give you extra room to work with or remove the  tires. Will give them a few months  to see how they hold and maybe replace  the rear ones.

Great kit. The manual that is included won't really help you. Go online and get all the info u need to help u build yours. Do your research and check your local laws if you want to register it as a homemade vehicle. Some states will allow this modification on your bicycle. 80cc will be considered as a motorcycle in some states.  I've seen customers have issues, some from pics seem to be owner errors from over tightened bolts to blown motors in first rides. Most likely from poor mixtures to no research builders. If your new to these builds research is key. Learn all you can before doing this to a bike. Know which bike is best for the build and learn how to mix fuel ratios and use top lubes and non ethenol petrol. If you want it to last treat it with the good stuff.

Love these lights! Bought them for both my vehicles. I use them for reverse lights. They're the next best thing to having rear facing headlights. They give me a much larger and clear picture of what's behind me. A much better improvement over the stock yellowish halogen reverse lights. Plus these get noticed! With yellowish halogens people most of the time don't even realize you intend to reverse, but with these they notice right away. Quality and affordability in one product. Thank you for making such a wonderful product!

Do not buy this item.  It does not fit.  Bought this for my 2003 BMW 325i.  It is way too short for the rear brake.  The picture looks long enough but when you get the item, without opening it you already know it won't fit.  Way too short.  Looks like it should be for the front.  I think they put the wrong item in the wrong packaging.  As you can see in the pics, one is for the front and one is supposed to be for the rear.  The one for the rear looks nothing like the picture.  Anyway, Im returning it and not for free, Amazon wants me to pay for shipping back.  Ive never had a bad Amazon experience till now.

These knock sensors were a direct fit for my 2001 5.3L Chevy Silverado. They were shipped loosely bagged inside the amazon box with some air pillows but arrived undamaged. This is an area of concern that has been discussed however the parts arrived undamaged. One thing to note is that although this is an OEM part, the product is assembled and made in mexico. Upon installation however that did not seem to matter as the sensor performed as it should. These same sensors cost twice as much at the local auto parts store. Amazon had the best value with it being just slightly over another websites price but having two day shipping with prime. The knock sensor performed flawlessly at first start up and its been a week now with no problems. No more CEL :)Some things to note if you are performing the knock sensor job on a GM:Make sure you have an open weekend to perform this job, It will take upwards of 6-8 hours.As noted below, since the manifold will be off, now will be an excellent time to replace optional parts. You might also want to do additional maintenance such as cleaning the IAC, MAF and throttle body.Parts you will need:2 Knock sensors (usually only the rear gets damaged but since this is a large job you might as well swap them both)1 Knock sensor harness (The old one will be useless. The boot won't seal tight and the connectors will be brittle and likely break)1 Intake manifold gasket (This is a given. You do not want to do this and have a vacuum leak after putting it all back together)1 Throttle body to intake manifold gasket (You will problably unmount the throttle body for easier removal and cleaning)1 RTV tube (High temp is preferred. This is used to create a dam and keep water from entering the knock sensor and corroding it)Miscellaneous Optional:1 Bottle of Throttle Body Cleaner (While the whole manifold is off you may take this time to clean the throttle body thoroughly.1 bottle of MAF cleaner (To clean the Mass Air Flow sensor and Idle Air Control Valve)Some Shop Towels: (You will be doing alot of cleaning of parts caked with grease/dirt/grime)Shop Vac:(No matter how careful you are chances are leaves or debris will fall into the cavities of the valves/knock sensor while removing the manifold. A shop vac makes quick haste of cleaning all this debris)Other parts to consider replacing while you have the manifold off:Valve cover gaskets w/grommets(This is a perfect time to replace the valve cover gaskets if you notice any small oil leaks)Heater Hose Quick Connectors:(These things are also notorious for breaking in alot of GM trucks near the firewall. If you have never replaced them, now would be a good time to replace them since you will have easy access to them)Note: I did not include any part #'s as they will vary per vehicle application.

2006 Keystone Laredo. I was unable to keep water in toilet bowl untill I replaced old seal with this one. I have a model# 210 toilet. All in all it's pretty easy to change this seal, as my whole bowl is essentially held on with one pipe fitting screw clamp assembly, which holds the two half moon plastic clamps. Toilet holds water like a champ now. Seal is working as it should. Been in place for almost a month.

This arrived today and to be honest I wasn't expecting much.  It turned out to be simple but fairly well designed product.  I will know in the coming weeks as to how well it performs, and if I have any problems.... I'll update this review accordingly.  I review products based upon several factors:1. Shipping speed2. Packaging3. General Overall Eye Appeal4. Design Quality5. FunctionalityThis product was shipped and arrived quickly.The external packaging was pretty plain and not much to look at but the item appears to be well made and of decent quality. I removed a star for the lack of creativity in packaging as all people in sales should know a product well displayed is a product half sold.The eye appeal on this item is nom existent.  I removed another star for this.It seems very functional and well made as stated above in the coming weeks of use I will update this review if I feel it does not meet a standard of excellent to high quality performance under general and stressful conditions of continued use.I received this product @ a discount for a fair, honest, and unbiased review of the item.

I have an aluminum cover on my 3rd brake light.  It hasn't been cleaned polished since the day it was installed more than 15-years ago.  Removed it and worked it over for about ten minutes but the 100-degree heat outside was just too much.  I'll pull it off and work it over next week when the temps are cooler.  Nonetheless, the cover looks 100% better!

I purchased this for my 2014 Wrangler Rubicon 2 door. The first thing that irritated me is seeing the box show up at the door with 2 big holes and packing tape repairing the "factory seal" tape probably added by UPS.  The two hangers were poking out each end of the box and the muffler sliding back and forth inside. Luckily after opening the box it didn't appear that anything was damaged because of the packing added all over the muffler itself. I was also concerned about losing any hardware inside. Again I was relieved to see everything was still in the box amazingly. I don't think that this is new because I've see a YouTube video showing someone unpacking one and it had exactly the same problem.Ok, I got that off my chest. :)As I said the muffler was protected very well even with it popping out of the box. Everything looked good. Installation was very easy. I usually take more time installing this kind of stuff since I worry every detail. It took me probably an hour from disconnecting the negative lead on the battery (per the directions) to test starting it. It looks really cool and sounds good.  I have read some that have said that the muffler is "very loud". Actually it is not that bad. It does give the jeep a deeper exhaust note which was badly needed. There have said that it drones on the freeway; I really haven't noticed this although I do get a bit more wind noise because of the Gobi Roof Rack.I would definitely recommend this. I have yet to see if there is a noticeable change in gas mileage. I really don't feel like I have noticed any difference in power; it drives about the same.

Got these after reading reviews.  Price is good and they looked nice. Only complaint I had is the instructions were not very clear on which mounting brackets went were. Once I ignored the instructions and saw the brackets actually had stamped on them where they go, all was well. Installed on a 2016 Dodge crew cab. Frame had threaded inserts so install was easy once I figured out the brackets. Fit and finish seems good, good product.

Awesome add to my Jeep! Very easy install. Did it alone by the most part with a bit of help from by 12 year old.  All hardware needed is included even for the oem fog lights although you must order the harness extensions. I am glad I went with this bumper instead of paying high dollar for a name like fabfours. I had read reviews in the bumpers getting rusty really quick but  I have seen fabfours get rusty as quick too. What do you expect they're metal. Just inspect occasionally and it'll be all good. I'd spray some high temp rustoleum for that issue.

Just completed a 11K 28 day cross country trip. Great bag on top of my Kuryakyn large bag and wasn't top heavy. Was very easy to rig using the quick disconnects that came with the larger bag. Held up in light rain without leaking, since I stacked them I couldn't use independent rain covers. I needed one bag to cover both luggage pieces. Ended up using a contractor bag cut to length and the larger Kuryakyn rain cover for both bags I secured the bags with a bungee pulling on the two looped draw strings... worked perfect. Never had a water or disconnect issue.

This stuff is pretty cool, I spray it on wipe with microfiber cloth, and wipe again to finish it off with a dry microfiber cloth. I'll take their word for it that it works chemically, and molecularly etc etc. all I know is it smells amazing, and looks great when you're done. The finish is beautifully smooth feeling and looks sharp. I have a silver Ford Fusion and you can see your reflection. It's definitely worth the buy.

There are several problems with the ones I received.1) They don't match the picture, which is clearly an OEM product.2) The stems are WAY too long on 80% of the ones I received in this pack. This causes them to be exposed if you push them in just to the point where the outer piece expands. If you push the stem in until they are flush, the outer area will contract again.- There are even some stems that ARE the correct ones in this back, but I have only found 2!!3) Cheap, brittle. They are not solid, and I suspect they will break easily in cold weather. They might hold up fine in hot weather but what good is that?4) Poor worksmanship. There are extra bits of plastic all around these, not trimmed.

I used this product to spray my brake calipers.I started off by sanding then cleaning. (400 grit, 800 grit, 2000 grit) then brake cleaner and alcohol.Followed by masking of all brake components and surrounding parts. (Over spray sucks mask well my friends)Spray the coats smooth and evenly, do not over spray.Follow the instructions and let the product cure properly.I finished my coats off with a gloss clear coat for a layer of protection and shine.Now, it looks amazing. I am very happy with the results and highly recommend this color for those looking to be different!

Was so excited to receive this grill after doing hours of research BUT what a disappointment! Plastic had a couple flaws in the plastic, did not fit right around existing items like sensor cord and bracket and the slots for the turn signal lights were cut too big so the lights don't stay in. The last two issues are the rubber across the top is so messed up you can't shut the hood without tucking the rubber back and the fit is off by more than a 1/4" to one side.Now I have to figure out if there is another brand with the same style that actually fits.

Received the ten LED lights in an envelope SUPER FAST, 8 of them worked wonderfully and 2 were D.O.A. Incredibly bright for their size! they have a myriad other uses. Each LED light has a nearly 2 foot long lead, which should work well for many different installations..Time will tell about It's durability, but I'm pretty sure they'll be good to go for a long time.

Light is amazing in my 2014 Kia Sportage. But the H7 in the 2015 Sorento is a problem. The clip that holds the light in, is also what houses the power connection to the bulb. So there is no way to hold in bulb beings the configuration changes when you convert to LED..... So buyer beware when buying H7 style bulbs.**Update** Was contacted by seller. Unfortunately it was after I returned the bulbs. They inform me they offer the clips needed to install the H7 bulbs free of charge. Maybe that should be included when people order H7 bulbs? Anyway, they were good with communication and as I said I do like the bulbs in another vehicle.**Update*** The seller has contacted me again and offered to replace the bulbs and send the proper clips. I hope to receive them soon. Will update again with pictures etc when they come in.**Update*** So. I have received a set of complimentary bulbs. BUT! They didn't include the clips I need to use them! Which is the whole reason I returned them the first time. So, I am done with this situation. 3 stars for trying to make things right but failing to fix the whole reason I returned the bulbs. I am buying my own clips. I KNOW they will be here in two days.

Late review.  Bought these in October of 2016 and in the beginning was impressed.  The lights still work fine, however the black color on the surface has faded from the original black color to a goldish color after being washed and being exposed to regular off-roading. The front of the lights have been kept covered when not in use and you can see the difference in the color.  I will be contacting the company to see if they will make things right. If they are willing to replace them I will revise my review.

Finally! The local parts houses kept giving me the incorrect bushing. I need it for a Muncie M20 32 spline output shaft and it is 2.010" outside diameter. The ones the locals gave me was an incorrect 1.998" and had no interference press fit.Pictures show it installed. I used a Honda ball joint press adapter as the perfect size to fit inside of it and press it in.I tested the drive shaft and it is a smooth fit.

Suspa gas strutsTwo Suspa 80 pound rated struts would not hold open a hinged lid weighing 115 pounds.  It would quickly lower on its own if not caught.  Fortunately, I had a second pair of new Suspa struts available (35 pounds lifting force each), so I mounted all four struts on the same lid.  It now opens easily, stays up by itself, and closes with little effort.It would be good if Suspas web site or the instructions advised the strut lift force to use on custom projects; and a description of the relative location of the upper and lower studs.  Replacing existing struts is clear, but for new projects with no studs mounted, you're on your own, pretty much with trial and error.In any case, the two sets of Suspa struts do a wonderful job simplifying the raising of that heavy lid and holding it up.

These were exactly what I needed. They allowed me to install almost all the HID wiring inside my lamp housings for a stealth install, they eliminated the need for Bulb Out Warning resistors, AND they allowed me to have high and low beam. Oh, and they are so simple a five year old could plug them in, and they work great!

This Overland Ironworks Decorative Metal Home Key Holder is well made and is very cute! I love that this key holder has 5 "legs" for you to hang up your keys and because they aren't extremely close to each other you can actually hang up other items as well like a hat, coat, lanyard, or whatever else you might want to put on it. I also really like that it's black because it goes well with any theme/color of any room in my house. It's made of metal which makes it really sturdy and durable. This key holder comes with the screws that you need to hang it up which I really liked because I didn't have to search around my house for them. I would definitely recommend this Overland Ironworks Decorative Metal Home Key Holder!**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**

I was very skeptical at the idea of purchasing this item. After all, for only ~$120 what could one truly expect considering this part costs over $500 from the dealer. Wow, I am 100% happy with my purchase. Not only is it great quality, it looks exactly like OEM with good quality materials used. It comes with the metal clips needed as well. One thing I can't believe is that Amazon was actually able to ship it using UPS and with my free prime 2-day shipping! The UPS guy brought out the package, obviously huge. It's the grill so, it is about 5 1/2 feet by 1 foot wrapped in cardboard and a big plastic bag cover.I was pretty distraught when I noticed a black frame piece sticking out of the bag. Ends up that the corner light pieces are "detachable". Thats in quotes because while they are in fact different pieces they are supposed to be clipped and glued to the frame. I definitely didn't want to exchange it considering the size and pain it would be to order another one. But it turns out all I had to do was clip it in and then use some super glue to keep the headlight piece on, good as new. Note to UPS: take a bit of extra care with these big items please!Besides that little mishap, I am more than satisfied with my purchase. The front of my Sierra now looks brand new again! For the price, you will not find a better deal out there. Note: this is for non-HD 03-up Sierra's (although it will fit 09-02 Sierra's as well, like my 2000 Sierra 2500LD, as I wanted the updated front) Highly recommend if you want to make the front end of your Sierra new again.

I needed to install some patch panels on the fenders of my 73 chevy truck. I don't have a welder so I thought I'd try this stuff. Big mistake!Obviously you need their applicator gun, but I had a hard time justifying the $50 purchase. Instead, I found a generic epoxy applicator gun at a local hardware store for $30. I guess this was my second mistake (my first was buying this crappy glue in the first place). Check out the pictures, you'll see what happened when I tried to use this epoxy applicator gun. I tried to adjust the gun to fit this tube but it was impossible to get it right. But I tried anyways, with the pushing rods slightly off axis. This failed and both tube caps got pushed sideways and the stuff inside the tubes went nowhere.Next, I just tried mixing it myself the old fashioned way: with a plastic knife on a pizza box. I meaded it just like regular epoxy or JB weld. Then I speared on on the patch panel surface and held in on there over night. After a full 24 hours, the adhesive was not hard yet!! I grabbed a big screw driver to pry off the panel, but to my surprise it was stuck on there pretty well despite the fact that the adhesive was still gooey. Time will tell if it holds, but it's now under a layer of fiberlgass bondo, regular bond, and rustoleum paint...I threw this crap in the trash and bought some welding wire and borrowed a welder to finish the other patch panels.

Deeply disappointed. This is not "custom" it's one size fits most. When I asked the manufacturer I was told here will be a 1.5 inch space between the sides. This is far from a "Custom fit" I own a 2013 GMC Acadia. This doesn't fit as described.

71tsvweNWyL._SY88.jpg
I wasn't expecting a whole lot but I was still disappointed with this mount. It's like the people who made it never even tested it, driving to Starbucks for your cafe mocha is not "testing".A stock Jeep Rubicon(2004) rim will not fit on without grinding on the set screw nut for clearance. The set screw itself does nothing since it has only support on one side so when it is tightened it just bends the metal it is welded to. I'm probably just going to cut it off and weld on a new tube.This mount would be okay at $25 but not for $80+.

I bought this inverter specifically to keep my 2012 15" MBP charged during a 18 hour road trip. I had several other inverters on hand and none were up to the job of keeping my laptop charged in the car. This little cup size inverter from Energizer worked like a charm. I was able to put it into the center arm rest of my Buick Enclave and plug it in out of sight in the hidden power port. I then plugged in my 85w power brick, snaked the cable out and closed the cover. It powered my laptop without a hiccup for the entire trip. The bonus was not having to see the inverter, or have it in the way, while we were traveling due to its small size.There are two downsides for me. One is that there's no power button. When it's plugged in it's on and that's it. I have to actually reach in and unplug it when it's not in use and I'd much rather just hit a button to power it down. The second issue is that when the power brick is plugged in it obscures most of the USB ports so for me it's an either/or situation. I wish there was a little more of a gap between the 110 outlet and USB ports.Regardless this was just what I needed and it will be a permanent fixture in my car going forward.

I installed the tonneau in just a few minutes. I like the material and the fit and finish. I am not a big fan of the clamping system as the bolt tends to pop above the slot it is supposed to sit in and you have to fuss with it. It's not a big deal, but a better design would make it much easier to re-clamp the top.

The lights are amazing. Delivery was superb. I agree with other posters that the sticky tape is not very good. I surgically cleaned my parts including wax and grease remover and still spent 6 days glueing them down with E6000 industrial glue. Thats one fix. (6 days because I had A LOT of curves)  A 2nd fix, use a 3M double back tape if you are placing them somewhere NOT in eyes site. 3M your part and then place the LED strip. This is not a new issue, one just has to think outside the box.  All my LEDs worked and I ordered 16 pieces.  See the photos below.

These are awesome, threw on my '16 Subaru Outback with 245/65/17 Falken Wildpeak AT3W's.  It's close, but zero rubbing after 1,000 miles and plenty of suspension stressing at speed.  Guess that's unrelated to the product though.Arrived well packaged, no damage to wheels, and they've held up great thus far.  Might not be the most durable spoke design but I don't see these giving me any problems in the future.

I put this in my camping trailer and am using it to monitor DC amps. We plan to do a lot of dry camping and knowing our actual draw (vs what websites claim) goes a long way toward battery management.  This comes with all the needed parts and with a bit of electrical background is an easy install.Mounting this was not fun. I bought a wall plate at Lowes (used for light switch) and cut a rectangle hole in it for this. The tangs on the side of this unit didn't hold anything and broke very easily. I used hot-glue and it holds it tight.

This item emulates the appearance of genuine Toyota wiper blade, but it is not same construction.  Whereas genuine Toyota wiper is tournament design (multiple links support blade at multiple points), this Trico product is modern beam design with plastic cover over it to emulate the look of genuine part.  The result is very indistinguishable appearance, if not same down to every detail.  I liked the performance advantage of beam wipers (although different brands) which I have experienced in my other cars.  I expect the similar performance advantage with this Trico product.

Let me start by saying that I'm an old mechanic, and I understand a lot (yet - not all!) about motor vehicles.  I'm not a professional mechanic, but I was in the '80s.  This to say that I'm not fully adept at today's electronics, but I'm getting better.I bought this unit Hoping to get a little deeper into the brain of my 2011 Mercedes CLS63 AMG.  I have an issue that I can resolve using Mercedes' STAR diagnostic tool, but that route is too dang expensive.  I was hoping this MBII Carsoft unit would be able to do the one thing I really wanted to do - which is code out the TPMS on the Merc.  Basically, I deleted the TPM sensors on my car when I changed the wheels.  Thought I could just take the car to the Mercedes dealer and have them tell the car's brain that it didn't care that the TPMS didn't work, and "Code it out".Well, the dealer won't do that, because they say it's against Fed Regs.Option #1 would be to buy the Mercedes STAR diagnostic software and a laptop to run it.  I know this would solve my issue.  Well, that option is around $2k.  After reading about the iCarsoft unit, I had hoped that it might be able to code out the TPMS issue.  Figured I'd risk the $150 or so to see.Well, it won't do what I'd wished it would do.  Tried a number of different things and different menus, and while it will "reset" the warning light so that it goes away...this is only temporary and the TPMS light returns after about 20 miles or so.So, from what I can tell, this MBII unit will get you further into the diagnostics of the car's inner workings, and will show you things: values, voltages, resistances and open circuits - that a regular OBDII diagnostic tool that you'd get from the auto parts store - won't.But, this tool will not let you code out, or change the values, of systems in your car - like the STAR diagnostic tool will.ICarsoft developers:  If I'm incorrect in my evaluation, please contact me and let me know.  I'd be glad to reconsider - if I'm in error

I've got a Delta seatpost-mounted rear rack, and I was looking for a good-quality cargo net to securely hold my bike locks, small bag of groceries, etc.This is it!  It's not the cheapest, but it's very good quality.  Here's what I like about it:1) Good quality stretchy netting; the cord seems to be heavy-duty, about 1/8" in diameter.  The cord is doubled around the perimeter of the net, which sees the most stress.2) Durable plastic hooks.  They can slide a bit along the cord, and the hooks are the perfect size to latch onto my Delta rack's rails.  The hooks look quite robust, so I'm not worried about them breaking.This definitely beats the bungee cords I had been using earlier!PS - I've uploaded a couple of photos showing "normal/small" and "medium" loads in my use.

With such a basic purpose, this funnel set serves it perfectly. Plastic is rigid and doesn't seem to stain. Super smooth surface so the stuff you're funneling doesn't seem to stick. The smallest one is a little too small for most purposes, but I use it fill a flask. Attached picture next to a 5 dollar bill for comparison.

I have an older model silver Ford Focus, purchased used.  The seats were decent looking, but who doesn't like that "new" look.  I picked up the Venice Series Car Seat with Gray Stripes to compliment the lighter gray interior.  So far, I'm really happy with how sharp they look.All together, you receive 9 pieces.  For your front seats, there are 2 headrest covers and  2 front bucket seat covers.  For the rear bench, you receive separate back and bottom pieces and 3 solid black headrest covers.  The front covers work best (and I haven't tried any other style) if you can remove the headrest before putting on the seat cover, and the bench seat back piece contains a zippered panel.  The zippered panel is a great addition if you have the middle fold down section to access the trunk.Like I stated above, installation is easiest if you take off the headrest.  This took me a couple minutes to figure out the release, but the rest was a snap.  The covers slid over my seat with a little resistance and I would expect them to be snug.  You may need to tug here and there to line up the stripes.  There is a small bar sewn in at the seat bend, which you can push through the crevice where the seats meet.  The covers also have a Velcro strap to pull them even tighter.Please note, I was lucky enough to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

Simple and efficient leather bag. Huge size. I still installed it in my windshield and it took almost all the width of it. It could hold sunglasses, cables, a GPS, a big phone or anything you need, even a quart size bottle. Practical because of the Velcro closure. I believe this is not real leather because of the low $17.95 price, but it looks and feels great nevertheless. Only downside is that is kind of stiff, and when installed with one of the windshield screws, it deforms the cover a bit. That's why the 4 stars.

The tool that I received didn't have any solid pins they are all the split springs to bad nobody updated the picture to reflect the actual product.  Haven't used it yet tomorrow begins the fun we'll see if it holds up after two barring replacements if it does one more star.

Amazing bulbs, got them for my clear taillights because incandescent bulbs looked pink. These bulbs are brighter, light up faster, more red, and visually overall more appealing as well as oem fitment. Just pop in and go! They're easy to see during the daylight hours as well, smd leds are very bright and have gotten much better over the years, my entire car is running luyed leds because of thier price, how bright they are, and the fact they outperform other high end led brands like superbrightleds which I've had go dim on me over and over. These are the brightest dang leds I've seen! The change over from running lights to when you hit the brakes is very noticeable and you won't have to worry about people not seeing you braking.

Nice, Bright white flood Light for off road biking. Very Bright! As noted by other buyers, the mounting point to the light itself is not very snug and the bolt used to hold the two pieces together seems very cheap. My solution to this was to fill the whole area with JB Weld and then screw it together, letting it sit overnight. No more wobbling around, and feels much more secure.

Cut to a rough dimension, stripped 3/4" of the underside insulation away around the perimeter, and folded the edges over to give a cleaner look. Formed to my turbo manifold very nicely. I used a thin screwdriver to punch holes in areas where I could get a stainless locking tie inserted and have it secure to the pipes. I used Dorman stainless locking ties from the local auto parts store and they worked perfect. Haven't fired up the car so can't comment on performance, but installation was much easier than expected and it turned out pretty nice.

Got these to go in my 2015 Ford F150. Read some of the other reviews where they state these are not bright enough. I think people are putting them in as headlight replacements and not as fog lights, which is what they are designed for. They are plenty bright enough for that. They are brighter than the stock bulb I replaced them with and match my headlight color perfectly, which are factory LEDs. I just got them and of course hope they last as long as stated. Time will tell.I added a photo with the drivers side having the new LED and where passenger side still has the stock bulb. Judge for yourself.

Served its purpose, yet barely. I forgot to remove this lock when backing my Vulcan out of the shed today. It worked in that the bike stopped from rolling backward however the locking pin bent preventing me from unlocking it. A Dremel with sixty seconds of my time and this lock came off easily. I'm no longer confident with this type of lock. Perhaps if the pin passed through both sides of the case it would have not failed.

Cover appears to be good quality and feels sturdy. Like others have mentioned this could be about a little longer but it does cover both ends. Very easy and fast to roll up for full bed use. I would buy this again even though it is a touch short and would be nice if it had manual tension. Can't expect perfection at this price. Trucks with factory plastic bed rail covers will need extra weather stripping along the front of box to raise it to the same level, topper tape works great.

After 16yrs and 225k mi on the original LLS, one of the rear air springs sprung a leak. It was a good time to replace the suspension. I decided on the Monroe kit mainly due to its low price, but also because its Made in USA. I am happy with the performance of the new suspension, although I am not happy with how much higher the rear-end sits. I'm hoping it settles at least 1-2 inches. I'll probably end up raising the front-end slightly by tightening the torsion bars.It took me 8hrs to install the suspension in my driveway using floor jacks. Most of that time was spent (wasted?) trying to get the rear springs and front C/Os to fit. But I learned a few things and included that information below. I also cleaned, bagged, and tiewrapped my LLS lines in case I want to revert back in the future. It was also a good time to lube all my suspension bushings.These installation tips based on the Monroe's Installation Instructions (which you should read and follow)Front:- No need to remove the upper control arm as shown in some installation videos online.- No need for a strut compressor.Step #5 The rubber bushings have a fat and narrow side. Install with the fat side facing the upper shock mount hole on the chassis. This will insure proper centering of the shock shaft. I found it much easier to tighten the upper shock mount nut from under the hood using a long extension. You'll also need deep sockets to clear the shock stud and a thin wrench (14mm iirc) to prevent the shock shaft from turning as you torque the upper mounting nut.Step #6 If you don't have enough clearance to position the lower mount, loosen the swaybar nut under the lower control arm until the nut is flush with the end of the bolt. This lowered the lower control arm just enough for me to slide the lower mount into position. After it's in postion, use a jack under the lower control arm to help align the lower mount holes. The lower mount bolt should slide into position with little or no tapping. Don't tighten the swaybar bolts until after the vehicle is back on the ground.Rear:- Borrow a Spring Compressor. I used an internal spring compressor.Step #10 Driver side - Before lowering your axle or removing the shock lower mounting bolt, unbolt the Emergency Brake Cable mount, it's held on by a large 24mm nut. Otherwise you risk kinking/cracking its rigid metal tubing when you lower the axle. (ask me how I know).Step #11 Warning: Wear safety glasses before venting rear air spring.  Of course you're already wearing a pair, right?Step #17 Use the included rubber isolator pad to determine which side of the spring UP. The pad will fit snug on top of the spring, and fits loosely on the bottom. Using the Spring Compressor, compress the spring approx 1-1/2-2". Spring should go into position with little difficulty. Do not reattach rear swaybar mounts until after the vehicle is back on the ground. This would be good time to lube the bushings with silicone grease.That's it. Follow the rest of Monroes included instructions and you should do fine. Good luck with yours!

These Projector lens LEDS are very bright for their size. These are a very clean white light with just a very very mild hint of blue.... I can NOT stand LEDs when they have blue in them but these are not like that there is only a very minuet amount of it. These LEDs feature a metal wrapped housing so that helps them to stay a lot cooler than the cheap LEDs that are just mounted to circuit boards in fact these were only 134.4 after being on for over 5 minutes. That is definitely cool enough that these should last quite some time. Heat is the number one killer of LEDs but that does not seem to be a problem for these ones. These lights arrived fast / on time too. I will upload some photos of these LEDs in use so you guys have an idea of their brightness and also I'll upload some measurement photos.- Honest customer reviews are very important to me because I always rely on them before I purchase almost anything online.

It did do the job, but you have to be careful and make sure the pins are lined up perfectly otherwise you can push the pin out the back and it won't work.  Fortunately the set is fairly cheap so it won't kill me to buy it again the next time I need to do my rear brakes.

Looks great on my 02 7.3 ccsb. No more rusty stamped metal. Got bolts and washers at local hardware store. Was only able to fit 3 quarts of fluid in after install(suppose to take almost 3.5 qts). Used lubelocker gasket. It works great. I can change again and again with out worrying rtv/silicone/gasket maker. Which I did! My fluid was horrible. So I ran cheap Walmart 75/140 fluid with trans x friction modifier for awhile. Then I switched over to royal purple 75/140. Which has friction modifier in it already. But to each their own...

I purchased this as a spare for my RV as part of my "emergency RV tool kit". It seems like it's decent quality.I wanted to be prepared in case mine ever bent or broke. Additionally I want to be able to help any fellow campers that may need the help.I circled it in the attached photo of my tool kit. I folded it open so it lays flat in my kit and doesn't take up much space. Cheap insurance to have a spare on hand.Overall I'm happy with my purchase.

These body post allow a lot of options for different 1/10 scale bodies. I have lost 2 body posts today at the track after a lot of high impact crashes. The 4pk of thumb screws is $8 bucks. For 15 you get new body posts too since mine were stripped out when the nuts broke off. Spend the extra $5 and get the kit so you have spare posts too.

i paid $7.98 prime for this and...it's awesome.  i've seen people using these shades over the years and never had the patience or inclination to use them myself.  what a mistake.  my cars have always had tinted windows, until purchasing a 2002 chevy tracker a couple of weeks ago with NO TINT on the windows.  it was brutal.  in the meantime, after ordering this, i already had the windows tinted.  tinted windows did make a difference, but then this item arrived a couple of days later and i used the shade today for the first time.  WOW.  i now realize how much heat comes in through the windshield.  using this, i was able to block light edge to edge.  the tracker is narrow, so the shade was a little wide, but i used the extra width to my advantage by pulling it into the center from both sides to block light from the entire area behind the rear view mirror as well.  it really works well.  it was so much better getting back in the car with this shade in place.  this is the only car shade i have ever used so i cannot offer a comparison with other brands.

I installed these down the hall of our 1994 Airstream Land Yacht Motorhome.  I am a complete novice at this and it took a while to figure out how to tie the lights in to the existing aisle lights.  I found a great youtube video that showed how to solder wires to the power leads and after that it was a snap.Because I have several twists and turns, the tape on the lights is not going to last.  I am fixing that by using a small bottle of liquid nails and supplementing the tape.These lights are very bright and are perfect to light up a dark hallway.  We are going to try a different color and tie those in to the courtesy lights.

Not sure if this was a manufacturing mistake or if the Budge brand has lowered quality over the past year but this cover started to get holes in it after 3.5 weeks in dry weather in san diego ca. I am very disappointed because it is basically trash after on month of use, $30 for one month of use is disappointing. I have had other budge brand covers last for 2 + years in the past. I washed, detailed then covered my tacoma before I left home for a month, came home and while removing the cover it ripped in multiple locations! I will not be getting another budge product after having this experience. Save your $30 and go with another brand. Hope this helps.

This is a very well contracted brush. It feels solid and well made.  The rubber bumper on the head of the brush protects well from pumping into painted portion of the car.  The bristles are very voluminous yet not stiff.  This brush is fuller and bigger than I imagined from the stock photo. I am attaching several photos next to the wheel of my car and a ruler so you can see it in context.I could not wait until the first reasonably warm day arrived so I can test it on my car. Finally, yesterday such day arrived.I have to say it did not work quite as well as I expected.On the positive side1) It was really much faster cleaning than the old small wheel brush I had2) It allowed me not to bend as much, which is the main I reason I bought it after having back surgery 6 months ago I still have limitations on my motion.3) It did not lose any bristles during the washingOn the negative side1) The brush's head is very large, so even in my car with a very large wheel detail I managed to get the brush stuck a few times.  The good news is that the rubber edge around the head did protect the wheel but I had hard time getting it out.2) It did not remove all of the winter grime, some tougher spots will require more elbow grease when my back is feeling better.  I washed it twice with the soapy solution, and once with the brush that just had plain water before rising off with a hose.I am attaching several photos showing the brush next to the car and the ruler so you can see its size. I also have close-ups of the dirty wheel and the wheel after cleaning.  The brush did a decent job even if it was not a perfect job.

Direct fit for my 2002 Ford Ranger XLT 4x4. Seems to be well made. Truck wasn't necessarily vibrating but more so a humming sound similar to an exhaust leak (at least in my case). Truck has 188k I'm the third owner so it was about time. It's now super quiet. All I needed was a breaker bar, 15mm deep and shallow and an 8mm shallow socket for the abs connector, 19mm deep for lugs, 32mm deep axle socket, 15mm combo wrench and torque wrench. Took me about 3hrs total for both sides. My biggest problem was removing rusted bolts. I used penetrating oil on both sides prior to work and anti seize and locktite during reassembly. If you need some help on this job search "hub assembly chrisfix" and/or "hub assembly 1a auto" on YouTube there is excellent content. Will update review if anything happens. This is my daily driver

I researched this before buying - looks like something the Japanese have used for decades. It won't work immediately or mask odors like an artificial smell would and it's not meant to do so. This is similar to putting a box of baking soda in the fridge. It works slowly at absorbing odors and helping develop new ones. If you're willing to take the slow route, I'd consider this product. It came well packaged; the bag is high quality and can also be hung. Time will tell how well it does in one of our musty closets.

Pretty easy job.  I put one up in my two car garage.  Pick out a spot on your garage ceiling to screw it in.  I read other reviews saying that the light was not bright enough so I tried to install the laser directly above the spot on the car I wanted to aim it at.  Trying to give the laser less distance to travel hoping to make the laser as bright as possible.  The electrical connections were a snap.  I just stripped the wires and inserted the white wire into  the white port with the 2 existing wires there already from the safety sensor and the same procedure with the black/white wire, inserting it into the grey port.  The laser is activated when the safety sensors are activated when you enter the garage. The laser stays on for one minute to allow you to park.  The hardest park or the most time consuming was adjusting the laser when the car was parked right under it.  With some hesitation, I finally stepped on top of my car so I could reach the laser and adjusts the beam accordingly.  Took about 30-40 minutes to install.  I am a bit of a perfectionist so it took me a little longer that it probably should.Like most of the other reviews, I agree that the laser could be a bit brighter.  Also the laser blinks.  It would have been much better if it was a constant beam.  I included a video of the laser.  But as for now it seems to get the job done.  We'll see how long it lasts.

How you install these depends on how the old bulb is held in place.  The dome light in my wife's 2004 Honda Civic sedan has C-shaped connectors that grasp the bulb at both ends.  The bulb slipped right in.In my 2013 Subaru Impreza hatchback, a pair of slotted metal blades hold the bulb.  They needed a little bending to wrap them around the pointed ends of the bulb.  In both cars, these bulbs bathe the interior with plenty of pure white light that's bright enough to read by while preserving the "turn down the house lights" effect without the flickering some reviewers mentioned.  One map light in the Subaru sheds enough light for both the driver and passenger.  Switch 'em both on and you have nearly enough light to perform surgery.As to getting the desired color, I ordered from YupBizauto on the "More buying choices" list and received 2 perfectly matched pairs of white bulbs shipped from California instead of waiting weeks for the boat from China.

This is the correct part for a 2006 Pontiac G6 V6 3.5L.  It is important that you make sure to check the numbers of pins on the electrical connection to the part because it can be confusing and the internet searches pulled up the wrong part repeatedly when I was searching for throttle body with TPS sensor.  Amazon's garage did help me fit the part to the car once I found the right part number, which is the AC Delco number listed in the product description.The throttle body with throttle actuator was the fix to clear two codes: P2101 (something went bad inside of the TPS/TAC system) and a P2135 (another code about the throttle positioning being out of acceptable limits).  This meant that something had gone bad inside of the black plastic covered area bolted into the throttle body.After replacing the part which  took only an 8mm and 10mm socket, flathead screwdriver, and about an hour I was able to clear both trouble codes and have had no further issues with the car.Overall this part fixed codes P2101 and P2135 on an 2006 Pontiac G6 V6 3.5L.  The car also now runs smoother and feels much better when accelerating.

This is a perfect light for off-road and amazing in place of high beams on Lonely stretches of road. Great side view and almost one klick of light down the highway.  I live in upper NE Vermont and the 11+K lumens just brings the sun back up! The quality is great; they stand up to all weather, road salt, & off-road punishment. I won't buy anything else. When the E2 is on, I can't even see the lightforce lights! Per state law, they are covered in the AM. You always get what you pay for and this is a great deal!!

Very strong odor!  Nothing "natural" about these guys, but they certainly get the job done!  I cleaned my motorcycle's chain outside.  Upon completion, I rode it around for a few miles per the instructions and then tucked it away in the garage for the night.  The next day when I opened the garage door, the fumes from the cleaner were overpowering!  I had to air out the garage the rest of the day!  Regardless, the 3 part cleaning process worked wonders and helped clean/lube my chain!  I've drive 100+ miles since the clean and lube and the cleaners have done an incredible job at helping my chain STAY clean by repelling further dirt and grime.  I'm very happy with this product.I didn't take a "before" picture, so I just cropped a picture of my bike from a previous day and zoomed in on the chain...but you can see how black and grimy it was...with the clean chain by its side!

Unfortunately, my experience was consistent with a lot of the others, the holes didn't quite line up.  It seems as though the steel ends are not far enough apart, or at least the holes.  I read the reviews so I knew there might be a problem with fit.  After fussing with it a bit, I also determined that the bolt holes in my frame seemed to point to the outside of my truck a bit, which obviously interferes with the sides of the hitch.  The fix was buying a large, round file at Home Depot and widening the holes on one side of the hitch by probably a 1/4 inch.  I also had to use smaller washers on the side I filed, as the hole was too close to the side.  I had to file the holes of the washers too so the bolt would fit in.Overall, I spent about 2 hours on this project, but I'm not mechanically inclined, and didn't have all the tools I needed when I started.  The hitch itself seems to be made very well, and looks great.  I think it'll be perfect for my personal utility plow.  Considering this is really the only option for a 2012 Nissan Frontier, it could have been worse.

Although Amazon says this pump will fit 2008 Honda Odyssey - it does NOT fit by a large amount (see pics).  The pump from the van is on the left in the photos, the pump from Amazon is on the right.  The only part that fits is the electrical connection.  If this pump fits your car, it would seem to be a good pump for a low price.The Odyssey pump has a much larger intake and 2 outputs, so this pump doesn't plug the hole in the bottom of the washer fluid tank and requires a t-connection to even fit the output side.  I was not able to doctor up something to make it seal on the tank though  :(

It was a perfect fit for my 2016 Toyota Tacoma Off-Road and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Smittybilt-29312B-Receiver-Hitch-D-Ring-with-3-4-Inch-Shackle-for-2-Inch-Receivers/dp/B001CF1A7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Smittybilt 29312B Receiver Hitch D-Ring with 3/4-Inch Shackle for 2-Inch Receivers</a>. Fits with just the right amount of play so it is not a pain to go in but fills the space nicely. Also in my opinion just the right length so its not too noticeable but is easy to use and remove. Let me know if you have any question or if this review was helpful.Update: I left this outside to test the rust claims of others and did notice that it is prone to some rust formation. I cleaned everything off and gave it a few coats of Rust-Oleum High Heat spray paint and I can't see this rusting anymore in the future. It also has a better matte black look which i prefer.

Showed up in great packaging but it was missing two very key allan heads the 3/8s on the tighten the bar down. Installed the rain gutter mounts. You do need to READ the directions 3 times before cutting the bar to length. And yes you will have to cut. My truck is 55 inches wide and I still had to cut it down to 47 inches. They say it will fit a 50 inch light. UM NO The 42 curved I have on there leaves exactly a 1/2 inch on both sides the 42" flat I had to reverse the brackets for it to fit. It took about three hours to build, measure and then cut and mount6 everything up. About another two hours to run wires. and bolt it down/ Took 3 attempts at tightening the clamps down properly. Got to say though very good quality and fit. Directions are cryptic though. Make sure a friend can help as well. The finish is great. nice hammer like black powder coat.

to many modifications had to be done to give more stars. I had to cut, trim, zip tie, and paint. All that said if you know what your doing and have got the tools and a weekend to give to just putting a grill in. You'll be fine. Looks great with all the proper fitment and finishing done.

OK to be honest it has been a WHILE since I bought a ( dare I say )  "quality" light, I have been running a set of 6" round 100 watt lights I got off the bay and was VERY happy with the output from them on my Jeep, just not happy with the RUSTING ALL THE TIME. Same thing goes for the "cheapo lights" I bought at local auto parts - good 100 & 130 watt outputs but the casings are rusting every week - mine get painted black usually after the second time they rust up.I bought these PRIMARILY because they are stainless, and 130 watt KC's. the last Daylighter I had ( wow that was back in the 80's )  I remember Daylighters being like an aircraft landing light 4 miles of light lol.These are bright (see pics) but definitely don't seem as bright as the old school KC's. I remember hooking that old light up on the roll bar in the center with four outer lights and the KC just blew them away -  one light literally turned night to day.These are bright but compared to the "bay" generic light not by much more ( see pic ), considering they cost $120 MORE I am still debating if they are worth it lol - I also purchased  the  KC light locks as anything with a KC name is a prime target for the crooks.

These bulbs are the perfect solution for those of us who have dazzling white LED headlights but where the manufacturer has used yellowish Halogen bulbs for fog lights.  I'm not sure whether the usefulness as a true fog light, with sharp cutoff just in front of the vehicle and to the sides is affected so if you live in a foggy area this mod may not be for you. Check the attached photo showing the before (yellowish Halogens) and after (LED bulbs) and the way they match LED headlights.  At this writing the bulbs have only been installed a few days so I can't speak to their longevity but the construction seemed first rate.

Great pack, Ive been very pleased with the chemical brothers products and instructional videos. Ive been working to remove swirls in cars for years and can finally say that Ive mastered it with this kit. I spent about 3 days pulling the swirls out of my car using three steps and the paint looks like glass. In the photo the jag comes in ultimate black which is a metallic paint. I wished Id had before photos but trust me, the reflection prior to the work was more translucent than transparent. Swirl marks were everywhere. You can actually pickup the metallic paint now. In fact, the dealer I bought this from said it looked better than when it left the lot.The buffer is easy to use too and the pads wash up really well. Its not as loud as I was expecting. Similar to a drill. I would highly recommwnd watching the chemical bros youtube videos as they provide some good tips.

So I received part number 158 instead of 058 but they ended up fitting just fine on my 07 double cab.  Took me 20 min to install.  They feel really solid so hopefully the finish holds up.

Bought these cam 1.5", 6' straps and used them last night. High quality fabric (a little soft though), good hardware & rubber coated hooks are very strong. Very good product & large cam shouldn't loose too much slack, but we'll see. I also bought the ratcheting tie down version but prefer these for ease of use & rubber coating. 4.8 stars.

The product arrived with a scratched lens (as you can see in the photo). I attempted to replace it with a new one but the second one that came in was also scratched and had a large smudge on the inside of the lens. Clearly there is a quality control issue at the factory as this is not an Amazon fulfillment issue.The lights are not super bright, but was never expecting that being a smoked out lens. The black look is really cool. I just wish the product was not so scratched up on arrival.Also super easy install. You don't even have to remove the spare tire. Just loosen the lug nuts so the tire can move out a little bit. Easy plug and play.

Great product!If you are worried that the Hi-lift or other items could fall,  I would say the chances are really slim. Two bolts go through the base and one goes through the top making a very sturdy mount.Use red loctite on all of the bolts.Others have written that you need a -20 fine thread tap. I did NOT with my 2010 Jk Wrangler. You simply reuse the 19mm bolt from the upper part of your roll bar.The instructions are not the best for the Jack mount and non existent for the tool holder. Take your time and look at the pictures here and other places to double check your work.

Fantastic quality and BRIGHT output! I swapped out HID bulbs for these and was expecting to lose some brightness on the road....nope! These are just as bright as the HID bulbs were. The lumen rating seems to be accurate and never again will I be buying HID bulbs. Can't beat the price either!!

This carrier is water proof sealed and has a lot of room. I build a wood box frame for what i felt was easier access and ability to strap to a cargo carrier. The glue on the velcro did peal on some areas but i put some adhesive on it and it went back on. On a cargo carrier the bag is short enough for drivers to see your lights and plates on a mazda cx5 and likely other crossovers.

These fit easily however you have to take the back plastic bracket off your old taillight to use them. Also do not use LED bulbs in them (instead of the yellow bulbs) as they will blow your fuse (No. 4) as mine did. I ended up using yellow bulbs eventually. I wanted my Jeep to look like this one.. at the Sema show back in 2009 on a Grand Cherokee Unlimited which is why I bought them. Mine is a 99 Grand Cherokee.My first set worked for about a month then the right turn signal went out only when parking lights on. Amazon sent me a full set to replace.. but I only needed back right .Installed the new one - works perfectly now.

This short pipe is not as loud as I thought it was going to be which is perfect.It is louder than the stock exhaust and now my R6 sounds like sports bike.Easy to install and it gives a pretty good look to the bike.Note. With a very fine sand paper I treated the pipe in and out and then splay painted it with high temp paint to have it to be a mate black and to last longer painted.

This trunk organizer folds up like an accordion the size of a large binder.  It opens up the fill nearly the length of my Honda Odyssey's trunk, but there's plenty of room in front of it, if I place it close to the seats.  If you don't have room all across your trunk, you can keep part of trunk organizer folded.  I've found it quit useful.  Each cubicle is larger than it looks.  I can fit 2 - 4 plastic bags full of groceries inside one box, and there are four sections.One insulated compartment can hold one gallon jug of milk, two frozen pie crusts, an extra large bag of cheese, and an extra large carton of eggs.  One day, I placed a full rack of pork ribs inside.  It wouldn't fit straight across, but it wasn't frozen, so it bent to fit inside.  Because the compartments are compact, the food stays cold, even in this triple digit heat.We get two insulated compartments (one on each side).  I would like to see the insulated sections combined, because I often have to remove the groceries from the bags and rearrange them so they would fit.  Other than that, I like it.This product was provided for review by Deler.

My fianc bought this for my trip down to Vegas from Spokane Washington. Had it on top of my crosstrek for a couple months before leaving town. Used it with the Subaru aero bars and it held just fine. Had to get rubber caps for the ubolts sticking thru tho.Lasted thru heavy snow and rain. Didn't notice any more  road noise than normal with it. Some of the welds had open holes which was rusting a bit but nothing dripped onto my car. Held up nicely with about 60-70lbs of stuff in the Keeper carrier, and with a Yakima cargo net holding it down. Noticed a drop in my mpg but that's expected with some extra wind resistance. Still going about 23-27 the whole trip thru high winds, snow, and with the whole bad end loaded up.Good basket for the price but could use some Bed liner or anti rust paint for some of the joints. And depending on how thick your crossbars are, you're going to need some rubber caps for the ubolts if you're hauling softer items.

I purchased this for my Massey Ferguson 30B industrial Tractor. I tied the lights into the factory switch and mounted them on the rollover bar. They are much brighter than I expected. Surpassed my expectations. My first thought when turning them on was "stadium lighting". Installation is easy, the bracket even has two raised parts to keep the bolt from spinning while you tighten the nut. The wiring is relatively short (under 12") so unless your harness is within 8" you will need a section of wire. I used a ring terminal on the black ground wire and attached it directly to the mounting bracket, this way I only had to run one power wire from my dash switch. Drill a hole, mount the bracket, mount the light, adjust the light and tighten it up. Easy. I'm considering getting another set for my lawn mower.

Arrived damaged, went to return but seller wanted me to pay return shipping. I decided since return shipping was close to $20 I would just put them on anyways.DON'T PUT THEM ON YOUR 5 SERIES!The fitment on just the left when completed was terrible, had 4mm gap on one side and the top looked like it didn't clip in bit certainly was. I decided to remove it from my 5 since it looked worse than OEM and now these are destroyed so in the trash they go. Complete waste for the landfill now..

Installed this 5 month late in my Toyota Echo (no fault of amazon, just a parody of events in my life) and it still fired up beautifully without needing charging. Has lasted three years and been through a beating. I sold the vehicle recently. The dude who bought it said seeing the battery in there was an edge maker over other vehicles in the market for him. Couldn't agree more.

I was buying a competitor's brand until they decided not to offer Prime Shipping any longer.  Much to my surprise this product is actually a little thicker or perhaps less water to make it.  It contains a small amount of wax (bonus) because you can smell it. (good thing)  Don't be concerned if it does not give you an immediate glossy feel to your car's paint.  It takes a few seconds to "cure".  Man, a beautiful shine you will get as a result.Common sense should tell you not to use this product for an extremely dirty car.  After a car wash, rain or just regular road grime, yet.  Caked on mud, etc. Well no..  Will buy again along with some other great stuff that Chemical Guys carries.  A++++++++

I received a product that's clearly been used (you can see dried soap on the bottle) and apparently even dropped a few times. If the visible damage is the only issue it would work but i payed $50 for a new product. Used items should have an appropriate discount and be sold as used. I've bought "Chemical Guys" products before and haven't had any major issues but this one's getting returned.

I have had my car now for three years and in that time I have gone through two tire pressure gauges. Although affordable, it seems like they don't really last very long. I thought that I would test out this digital tire pressure gauge instead. The device came in a packaging that was really easy to open and came with instructions. This device is super easy and does not even need instructions. All I had to do was press the only button and the blue light came on and it was ready to use. I tested this product out on my car tire and it read the pressure very quickly. I had to press the other button to get it to read PSI, but it was an accurate reading. If you hold down the button, it will also turn off. It was nice to have the blue light because you can see it in the dark and do not require a flashlight. The screen is also big enough to read without reading glasses, unlike other gauges I have tried in the past. This is really lightweight and has built-in grips for your fingers. It also has a hole where you could add a carabiner, which could be added to a backpack or installed somewhere in your car. I like to keep this gauge in my glovebox and it does not take up too much room.I received thisTravelsafer #1 Digital Tire Pressure Gauge at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. This review is entirely unbiased and is not dependent on my discounted price. I hope that this review has been helpful to you!

Really love these covers, they brought a whole new life to my TJ when installed. The vinyl material feels more comfortable and fabric like then what you think when reading the product description and the back cargo mesh adds that much needed extra storage in your jeep. Install was fairly simple, just pull them over and tuck what needs to be tucked in and fasten some snaps.Overall they make sliding in and out of a lifted jeep easier by not grabbing your clothing like the OEM seat's fabric did, and so easy to clean up and spills or mess (water, soda, food, etc) with a damp cloth.My only note to make is because it's a water proof material your back teds to heat up and possibly sweat a bit more during hot summer days but thats kind of the nature of the material. Also make sure you get the right cover for the right year as there is a difference between earlier model TJ's and the later ones (04 I think is the turning point).

I got this tire pressure gauge for my bike since I don't want to head down to the gas station every time I need to see what my tire pressures are. I could have gotten the pencil type tire pressure gauge but wanted a digital one instead.After opening up the package, I tested it immediately. The gauge has a nice sturdy feel to it so it's not made from cheap material. Batteries were already included so no need to buy your own until the time comes to replace them. A simple push of the button will turn on the digital gauge. There is a blue light that's being emitted so it helps in dark places to see the valve. Just push down on your tire's valve and it will show you the current tire pressure. There are 4 pressure scales (PSI, BAR, kPa & kg/cm2) which you can cycle through by just pushing the same button used to power on the device. After you're done you can either hold down that button for a few seconds to shut it off or wait and it will auto shutoff in about 30 seconds.I wish there was a way to quickly reset the pressure and measure my other bicycle tire. It requires you to power it off first and then turn back on to reset to zero. Not a deal breaker but a minor setback.PROS:- Seems to be made from good materials. Felt the heftiness on initial use.- Very simple to use. Just push the button to turn on and then push the gauge down on the tire valve.- Blue light is emitted when powered on so it's useful in places where there's low or no light.- 4 pressure scales (PSI, BAR, kPa & kg/cm2)- Auto shut off feature after 30 seconds- Lifetime warranty after registration within 90 days of purchaseCONS:- No way to reset the pressure measurement so I can use it for my second tire. Have to power off first and then power back on.I am overall very satisfied with this tire gauge. Even though it's a bit on the heavier side compared to a pencil type tire gauge, it does measure up to 150 PSI and is still very portable to carry on a bike ride or in the car's glove compartment for those who want to use this for their car instead.

The lamp was plug and play for my 1998 Jeep wrangler. The light doesn't work on a button type switch but rather appears to have a mercury switch built in that turns the light on and off when the hood is raised and lowered. You have to raise the hood about 18 inches for it to turn on and the light stays on even if you open the hood all the way and rest it on the windshield. In an effort to extend the service life when doing anything under the hood for a long period of time I usually simply unplug which is probably unnecessary.

Its really too bad that these did not fit on my 2015 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara! Visually they are a big improvement over the giant red factory tail lights, but at least the factory ones fit. As you can see in the first picture I attached, there is a tab on the plastic housing that prevents the tail light from sitting flush with the body of the jeep. Also, in the other picture, you can see that the screw holes do not line up which was preventing the screw from going in straight, and I wasn't about to force it...shouldnt have to!Be wary about buying these unless you're okay with modifying them and modifying your jeep to make them fit.

I'll start with the good... Easy to install, and can look pretty  clean with not too much time.Now the bad... First and most annoying, I wired the switch panel though my ignition  so the back light of the switch isn't on all the time. Then wired 3 different light bars too it. Now everytime I start my jeep the light bars, all 3 of them flash on then off. Then my other complaint is after owning it for a month one of the back light went out (see attached photo). So need less to say I'm very dispointed in this product would not recommend to any one. Waste of time and money I'm sure I'll have to buy another switch panel. Good idea just a poor design.

I was a little nervous applying this coating since it was my first time.  I watched as many videos as I could and read up the forums.  I take good care of my car so the prep wasn't too bad, almost like a new car.  Rinse, CarPro X, rinse, foam cannon, 2 bucket wash, rinse and dry., clay bar, Essence polish, Paint prep Griots Garage to remove waxes, applied the coating.  Started a small 1'x1' section then moved to 2'x2' section.  Got the hang of it by the third section.  It was user friendly but I'll let the pics do the talking

Well packaged, arrived in good shape, in original box marked "KOYORAD Complete Radiator".Installed this radiator in my 95 honda, which had a NipponDenso that was leaking around the tank somewhere.TYC radiator, comes with Radiator Cap and drain cock, and seems identical in fit as original.It does not include the rubber bushings at the bottom; I used the old ones which were in good shape.All of the holes for the fan shrouds lined up well, as did the Transmission cooler and coolant hoses.It is possible to loosen the trans. cooler pipes with a 19mm wrench; they have flared fittingsso they can be turned if needed (they lined up pretty close to the original but I adjusted one of them slightly).Radiator is made in Indonesia, and it seems a bit lighter weight than the original.The original Denso seems to have brass upper/lower rail plates (where the coolant tubes are attached),whereas this one seems to use aluminum plates.The fins on this one seemed very delicate and bent easily when I accidentally brushed against themwhile installing it (compared to the original one which was not so fragile).Not sure how long it will last but it was much less expensive than OEM Honda radiator.. time will tell.Overall, pretty much satisfied with it.

This thing is AWESOME! It's super bright. It's heavy and well made. It comes with the mounting brackets and all the hardware to install. I water proofed it by taking off the front lens and placing water sealant around it. I would recommend doing the same and also tightening the screws in the front of the light because I think they come a little loose. I can't speak enough about how sturdy this thing feels just simply holding it. I will update this post once i have had it for some time and have seen how it stands up to the weather. This is a very high quality light for the price. I would totally recommend this light.

this is not a big over powering shield and perfect for those of us who only want something to deflect the wind and eat the bugs. the fiinish on one of the bracket bolts was chipped off. i'll try some chrome paint. i put this on my suzuki c50 and it just disappears which is exactly what i wanted. one suggestion i'll give is don't be afraid to really tighten everything up. as you can see the windshield is barely noticable

Would have rated higher but customer service was pretty lame. I mistakenly ordered this because I did not read the product description close enough. I needed the set that works with factory rails not rain gutters. ONLY order this set up if you do not have factory rails. I emailed the seller and they told me since it was shipped by Amazon then I would have to deal with them about exchanging parts.I have found a way to make this work without the proper hardware using u bolts and a little bending and a little drilling. I have factory crossbars so that is why I can make it work.The basket is a little tight so wait until you have all the parts put together before tightening all the screws down completely. I also plan on covering all the screws with silicone to prevent rusting.I love the way this looks on top of my 2011 Ford Escape. The highway noise is not that bad doing 70-75.

Metal is the way to go.  I wanted to get an insert for looks and to protect the radiator, but not fall apart in the AZ sun.  Install was easy on my 2009 JKU. Need to drill 6 tiny holes that are hidden inside the grill even if you remove the insert. Took 15 minutes to install. I plasti-dipped the grill and insert to custom the colors.

Works good, covers well. Small openings on the sides where it's round and on the top where the rear view mirror is mounted. Easy to fold. Has instructions on a tag. I Use this on 2011 ford Mustang. When filed up, it's the same size as the stock steering wheel.

Easy install. Left hand seemed like it had a defect. When I turn it 360, you can see it's not round all the way. This is the reason for the 3 stars. Other than that, I love the RR lettering. Shipping was fast as well from the seller. Came in 1 week earlier than Amazon's estimate.

Free product provided for my evaluation and review.I received size LARGE.These gloves are true to size and fit a size Large well.  The fingers,especially the thub were just a tad long for me but fit a man's size large hand very well and the fingers were a perfect length.  They adjust and fasten with velcro in two places for a good fit on the palm and wrist.  Once fastened they stay on well.The knuckles have extra protection and padding but it doesn't inhibit hand movement at all- it is very easy to move my hands in these gloves.  The sewing is all very nice with straight, tight seams that give a flexible, comfortable fit.  The color is a true black.  They fit up to a 8.25 inch wrist well, any larger than that and they get a bit tight.  They have some extra fabric in strategic places to keep them from wearing very fast.  They look super cool too.

I have a 2007 Ram 3500 6.7 CTD 4WD.  Like others on here I followed the instructions to a "T".  The new sector shaft nut will not line up with the hole in the brace.  It barely makes it in the hole.  I have the adjustment maxed out just to get it in the hole and it rubs the side of it slightly.  There is not even close to enough adjustment range in the bolt slots to get it to line up.  I'm not sure if it's faulty or, if the compatibility of the product is not correctly labeled.  EDIT: IMPORTANT look at your steering box before buying this! The seller has a compatibility chart that you need to look at. Certain VIN's may be incompatible.  Heavy duty and upgraded boxes are unlikely to be compatible.  The BD one will work with those, but it costs substantially more.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/BD-Diesel-1032003-Steering-Stabilizer-Bar-Incl-Steering-Box-Support-Sector-Shaft-Bolt-Bearing-Assy-Hardware-Thread-Lock-Steering-Stabilizer-Bar/dp/B075NRN2GC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">BD Diesel 1032003 Steering Stabilizer Bar Incl. Steering Box Support/Sector Shaft Bolt/Bearing Assy/Hardware/Thread Lock Steering Stabilizer Bar</a>&nbsp;I leave the review at 3 stars because I think this product is poorly designed given the range of different steering box's that are in all 03-08 Dodge Ram's.  There are other companies that make these things and many of them are compatible with all of the box's.  How hard is it to make a knock off that is compatible like those?

It's on a 9K lb. winch on the front of my Jeep, been using it for just over two years. Couple of minor scratches on the rollers where I've done some serious pulling (like dragging a full-size Chevy truck up a hill out of the mud). The Jeep is always parked outside, and this roller has stood up well to the elements.

Installed in my 2018 Honda Ridgeline RTL-E high beam location. Color matches the OEM low beam LED's. Installing the bulbs took about 30 seconds each, and another 10 minutes to make a custom bracket to mount the controller boxes to the front body panel above the radiator area. In case anyone is wondering, PIAA is the same brand as the Honda LED's.The light output is amazing and the spillover when used as high beams is phenomenal! Highly recommend this addition to your G2 Ridgeline!

I have a set of aluminum rims which are a pain to clean and maintain. I used to use Meguiar's wheel cleaners, which removed the dirt and dust but never made the rims shiny. I did some research online and bought Mother's Mag and Aluminum Polish. I have to say its an awesome product. I used a polishing cone, which I attached to my drill to make the whole process faster and easier.  Polishing 4 18" rims by hand would take for ever.  It did take a few hours to clean all 4 rims but the after effects were amazing!  From far away they look as if they are chrome.  I highly recommend this product.  Check out the pics I uploaded.

I originally bought a set on Ebay that were cheaper.  NOT the same brand and definitely not quality.  Do yourself a huge favor and stick with a trusted name brand when it comes to your driving safety.  These are reliable and, don't require you to use their "specific" lug nuts.  Because the cheap ones required you to use their specific lug nuts, you cannot install locking lug nuts, plus, you couldn't torque them to a safe 85 - 105 ft-lbs so the wheels almost fell off my jeep.  THESE are GREAT adapters.  GET SOME!

Purchased this and mounted it on the bull bar of my front bumper on my 2011 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited. I am very pleased with the price, overall rugged feel and construction of the product. The light output blew me away! It literally brings the daylight with you. I compared to a buddies Jeep that had a 50" version of this (also purchased from amazon). While there were subtle differences in the lighting, this 20" bar definitely projected more light forward and down the road. I'm extremely happy with this purchase and the light output!! I'll update in the future regarding long-term durability, but for the price you can't beat them.

This is the second tire cover I've bought from this mfg and I really like them. I took one star off because the material is a bit flimsy.This cover fits my 205/75 15 spare trailer tire perfectly. It wraps around the back sufficiently and seems tight on the tire. There is an elastic cord around the opening on the inside and it has two hooks on the ends. I was able to hook it on the spare tire carrier.I mentioned that the material is kind of flimsy. I tore the material a bit on the bottom trying to get the cover nice and tight on the wheel. I'm sure I pulled it harder than necessary, but I feel it tore easier than it should have. It's on the bottom so I'm hoping it doesn't really matter.I think this is a good purchase at this price and would do so again. I'll update if it fades quickly or falls apart.Note: it looks a bit wrinkly in the picture. This was taken when the cover was fresh out of the box. It will smooth out once the sun is on it. My other cover did the same.

These are one of those "Duh, what a good idea" products, but the space on each vehicle almost requires a custom solution instead of this one-size-fits-all. I have a 2013 Honda Fit and as a subcompact hatchback, there's just not a ton of storage around the dashboard and center console. I was always losing pens and finding it hard to store a number of other small items. This mostly solves that problem, but the sizing isn't perfect.Your vehicle may have more or less room than mine, so keep that in mind. The organizers themselves feel fairly cheaply made from the outside. It doesn't matter *too* much, because for the most part they're jammed way down into the crevices between your seat and center console. I'm not crazy about the black/red stitching look, but it was the closest match for my grey interior.The organizers come with four foam wedges to create three  "pockets" in each. One issue is that they don't reach all the way to the bottom, so small items can shift around at the bottom. I found a few times my pens would fall down, so I ended up making one divider pretty small so they'd stand up. Another issue is that you're relying on them to hold the organizer open against the seat/console pressure. After a few days, one of the wedges is already buckling some.Overall they'll get the job done. You should measure your gaps first to see if this product will work for you though.

Amazing spray wax! Easy to apply and easy to wipe off, no haze or anything. You can apply it in direct sun and it leaves very smooth and wet/shiny surface. It works on glass and trims as well. I also use it pretty much everywhere in my interior as well. (Watch auto fetish detail on YouTube for an awesome trick and where to use it!). It doesn't lost long because it's not paste wax its spray wax but it does really good job. After 1 week of non-stop crazy rain in California (which we don't usually get!) it beads the water off the car and windshield and after a rain, you can still see the shine! It's been 2 weeks with rain on and off and it still looks clean/shiny and I notice that it helps with water spots! I always carry X-Spray Wax and Last Touch from Meguairs as well in my trunk. Try it and you will love it! Check out the pictures and you decide.

Very bright light but not an easy install.  (2 or more hours)  Had to adjust to mount on 06 Toyota 4Runner.  (See pic)  Reasonable price for this type of light bar.  Checked local auto parts store and similar light bar $60-$80.  If you purchase this light bar, suggest that you buy wiring kit.  Made the install easier.  If you've questions, ask.

The first thing I have to talk about is the size. It barely fit, like John Travolta 70's pants. It do run small, or true to size. So the measurements is exactly 36" Most pants give you some extra room. Not these! Most pant are cut to go around a 36" waist, these are cute to 36". The best way the order is to measure the waist of your favorite pants with a tape measure, then order that measurement. I am going to take mind to the tailor to add an inch or two the waist and hips. As for the length, I'm 6' 190 with average leg length (not long leg or short leg) and the knee pads are right on.The pants look strong and will stitched together. The vents look like it will be good for those hot summer days and I do like that you can zip them close. Plus it has a Mash on the inside, like track pants. It only have two very small pockets. It can only hold a very flat wallet. lucky for me that the kind use. Plus, the pocket has a triangle shape with the zipper on the side, making it even smaller. The pocket is about 4"x6"x6"(triangle shape).  Also, if your just standing around there's no pockets to put your hands in.Plus, The fly on these pant is way to small, it stops right above my junk.  I had to pull my pants down to do a number one. LoLPros:Low Price.Cool Style.Vent Placement.Will stitched.Heat protected Fabric.Level-3 Armor on the knees.Elastic panels on Front and back of knees.Cons:Cut small on Waist.Only two very small pockets.No Back pocket.No Hip protection.The Fly is to Small.I say buy it, you like it.netDon

very nice but bring a very big mistake, adhesive tape duplex is smaller and does not cover the relief guard and left edges of the easy lift and the name plate off the protector is not as strong.

Fits the 2013 Subaru Legacy perfectly.  The color match is almost perfect and despite it not having the brushed metal look of the factory piece, it does not look odd or out of place.  Very nice complementary color.  Used it with a Pioneer AVH-X2800BS.  There are 3 kits by Metra for the Legacy, this one in gray, this same one in black and a 3rd one that angles the radio to fit flush with the rest of the dash.  I did not choose that one because some radio do not fit or require modification of the car to make room.  I was not willing to do that and was also concerned about sunlight washing out the screen image.  This one and the black one mount radio vertically which leaves a 1 inch shelf of sorts at the lower portion.  Still looks great and allows rear passengers to more easily see the screen.

According to amazon, this fits my Subaru Forester 2009. It does not. Not even close. Thankfully I was able to return it easily and got refunded.I am giving it 3 stars because first, although it does not fit my car, I think the filter is amazingly designed and constructed. Looks and feels really sturdy and I like the metal grill on it. Secondly, to hopefully get the attention of Amazon to reconfigure it's "does it fit my car" to Doesn't fit the Subaru Forester.

If Subaru wants this in my vehicle, then I'm putting in. Its supposed to help head gasket failure in certain engines. People will argue that it doesn't work or do anything, but Subaru probably knows what they are doing and it's cheap insurance.* This stuff is supposed to be a red/brown color and look mucky so don't freak out and think it's gone bad.

The shunt has a problem.  The nut washer on the big post and the nut washer on the small post can touch each other.  The two posts should have been manufactured slightly farther apart, or smaller diameter washers used.  The shunt can still be used but the buyer will have to make corrections to insure that the two post connections don't touch.  I did not want to grind the washers to a smaller diameter.  Nor did I want to attempt to position the washers so that they would not touch when tightening the electrical connection.Additionally, there is no mounting flange, hole or feet for this shunt.  One must zip tie or glue it to a solid surface in certain applications.The attached photo shows just one wire attached and the big washer is already above the smaller washer.  I prefer not to deal with this type of equipment.I returned this item.

Amazon got the best price for this bumper if you catch it on sale and free shipping too.I got it for a few weeks now and i'm still at awe with how it changed the appearance of my Jeep. Its actually well built for a Smitty brand. I did have to make 2 of the mounting hole larger so i can slide the bolt to the frame. Other than that the install was easy as can be.You won't be dissapointed with this bumper. I paid 190 for it and i don't think there's even a comparable bumper w/stinger at that price range.

UPDATE 12/2/2015After having great success with the original two I purchased, I decided to order two more pairs! I have had no water or condensation get into the originals. One pair went on the visor of my truck. These will light up to the front and sides of the front of the truck, so I can see objects off to the side. They work very well. The next pair went on the back corners of the cab. These also serve for plowing. In addition to seeing directly behind me, with this pair I can see off to the back sides of the truck. I am really happy with these lights. Now when I am working in pitch black dark (which is very, very frequent) it is really easy to see everything around. Yes, you need these!To start off, I ordered a pair in the 60 flood pattern. These are backup lights for my GMC pickup, as well as working lights for when loading and unloading the trailers in the dark. I do lots of work in the dark, and the reverse lights on the truck don't always work, so I ordered a pair of these and wired them with a switch and I am very happy! For each light only drawing 1.5amps on the 12 volt battery, these are very bright. If I were to aim them higher up, they would shine pretty far, however, mine are aimed lower so that I can see the immediate ground. They also make for excellent work lights. As far as waterproofing, I can't comment. Currently it's snowing in Wisconsin and I can't tell if rain will get in, but by the looks of the lights, it looks like plenty of silicone was used. The only complaint with these lights is the mounting bolts. They don't break or anything like that, but for being "stainless" they rust easily (most likely a poor quality stainless). After seeing this, I just went to a hardware store and bought some good quality stainless hardware.If you are thinking about buying these, buy them. Just make sure you order the correct ones. There is 30 spot and 60 flood.

The short....Wow.  Pretty amazing.  I have been so nervous on buying LED lights for my RV because I didn't want to live in an harsh blue glow of some LED lights that are freaky.  These are not the case.  The have a nice glow that is not that different from normal old style bulbs.  You can stop right here and buy them....  Nice color and I would guess about 15% dimmer than normal bulbs.  But that is just fine because the old style bulbs were just tooooo bright to use in my rig.The Long....The first picture of the two meters below shows a reading with all 20 new led lights off in the RV.  There was a 9.0 amp draw from my battery. ( something besides lights we on )  I then ran around and turned all 20 of the new LED lights on. The second picture shows 10.6 amp draw.  Quick math says with all the lights on the 20 LED lights pulled only 1.6 amps more than the original 9 amp draw.  When I read the package it said each light pulls .15 amp per light.  So I expected to see all 20 lights pull 3.0 amps.  That was not the case in my RV.  Either my meter is not that accurate or it really only pulled 1.5 amps for 20 LED lights.  I don't know.  But I can tell you that with all 20 REGULAR old style bulbs I was at almost 29 amps draw on my meter.  I didn't think to take a picture till I had all the new LED lights installed but 29 amps is what was added with them all on.  Even if my meter is not perfect it did prove a point.  The LED lights use so much less power it was amazing. Going from 29amp to lets say 3 amps just to be fair.  That's the difference between leaving them on all night with out worrying or possible running the generator a bit before bed.  My RV has a home 700 watt solar system on the roof and 4 T-105 battery's in the rig so it will charge it self off automatically while I sleep in during the day.To be fair I would look for a brighter LED for the patio light.  I will see if I can find a super bright LED outside light.  These worked for outside but I really need a brighter light I think for the outside.  But for inside these are perfect.  Since I only really use a few lights at a time I will be pulling under half an amp while I sit on the couch and read.Price was also great since these used to be 9 bucks for one or two.I would buy again.  If something happens I will update this review.

Just installed so I'll update if anything fails but so fsr 5 stars. Real bright and clear. Ya there's no screws - if you're putting brake lights on yourself maybe you should be able to sort that out. And if you can't work out how to wire a three wire tail light hire someone.  Great lights great price, WAY better then 15 yesr old pods on my travel trailer.

Look awesome on my 03 ram 2500. They fit fine.Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the part that plugs in was loose and didn't make a good connection. Had to cut and splice the wires but it's a really easy install anyway. Great product and great price.

I had this delivered March 31 of 2018 and installed it that day. Since then it has seen about 11,000 miles of use. The rubberized coating has since started to slowly peel away but there is still absolutely zero bearing slop. The part you hold has a comfortable size and definitely aids in quick maneuvers in parking lots as well as backing trailers. It took about a week of getting used to compared to the billiard ball size one I had previously (which ended up cracking) but now feels like second nature to me. I prefer to have it mounted at roughly the 7 o clock position as it allows me to rest my hand while cruising down the highway. The bearing still spins smooth and free and there is no play side to side nor up and down and the clamp really holds this unit in place very tight.

I used this grill with a Z71 Emblem I paid $4.95. for. It looks better than the grill that cost $109 on Amazon with the Z71 Emblem. I installed a half inch GE silicone caulk on the back of the emblem after I put the screws in it. ( Holds to grill better - No scratches) Let Dry before I Attached it to the grill. I bought my own stainless steel screws, super easy. I did not remove the plastic I just pushed it over with my fingers  and installed the screws and brackets. It was a can of corn.....The bolts they give you with the brackets are very hard to get in there. I recommend getting smaller stainless steel with washers. Then you can push the plastic over to get the bottom Bolt in and it was super easy. Took me 20 minutes with the Emblem pictures attached. I saved One hundred dollars. If you have any questions. Just E Mail me. I will send Pictures to help you.....Regards Joe

This frame is perfect for me since it does not cover any of the plate but only enhances it. The chrome looks nice with a silver car and if you are like me and have a specialty plate or vanity plate you will not want that plate covered to begin with. Also it is illegal to have any of your state name, numbers or registration sticker covered by a thick frame (many states are starting to enforce this.). In some states it is even illegal to have your state motto blocked out. With that said this is a simple and inexpensive way to enhance your plate.

This is your standard 3 ton heavy duty steel truck jack. Came with minimal damage to the box despite it's weight.Included was a highly detailed instruction booklet with an exploded diagram and parts list. That tells me this thing is built to be serviced and repaired if necessary just like any quality piece of equipment.

FOLLOWUP 09-25-2015: I contacted ARB support, indeed this product does have a 24 month warranty for defects in materials and craftsmanship. ARB responded quickly, next morning in fact, and have taken care of the problem. Excellent Customer Support! Up to 5-stars from 3-stars because of how quickly and professionally they responded to my warranty issue.FOLLOWUP 09-23-2015: So I have had this bag loaded for a few months now. Regrettably one of the side pockets is beginning to blow out the bottom. I have only carried two 3/4" 4.5 tons shackles in this pocket. (See image) Checking on return/replacement warranty. Docked 1-star from 4-stars to 3-stars.It is a pretty decent bag. It's price is on the high side but the quality is commensurate with the price. Nice materials, the main body is heavy duty Cordura feels like 1000 weight ballistic of close. The bottom has some rubber type material, sorry can't identify it. The inside liner bag and compartment divider are a lighter gauge Cordura nylon. My only issue is how you actually carry the bag, there is no grab handle in the lid and the shoulder strap is bar tacked. If something happens to the shoulder strap you will have to be a little creative to repair it.That said, what I have in it is a pretty tight fit in this bag. There are two sizes of this bag, this is the large. I am carrying the following items:front pocket - 1x ARB ARB725 3-1/8" x 60' Winch Extension Strap - 17600 lbs Capacity -main pocket left side - 1x ARB ARB730US 3" x 10' Tree Saver Strap - 26500 lbs Capacitymain pocket right side - 1x Warn (88924) 3" x 30' Premium Recovery Strapmain pocket right side - 1x ARB ARB220 Orange Recovery Damperside pocket left - 1x ARB Products 10100020 20000 lbs Snatch Blockside pocket right- 3x Crosby 3/4" Size 4-3/4 Ton WLL Carbon Steel G-209 Screw Pin Anchor ShackleAll of the buckles are at the end of their straps. This thing is stuffed, there is a little more room in the center of the straps but that is it. I expected this bag to fit all of ARB's heavy duty line of products, which it does but just barely.This bag could benefit from a few more cubic inches, a little more length on the buckle straps, removable shoulder strap, and as mentioned lid handle.

I have been a big fan of K&N and their filters/cold air intakes for years now. I had one on my 2009 Mustang GT and it was fantastic as well as being easy to install.I bought this one for my 2014 Explorer Sport. Unlike one of the reviews, mine came with all the required parts. It took me about 90 minutes to install the piece. There isn't much difference in sound when the engine is idling, but when you're accelerating, you can hear the air being drawn into the massive cone. There is noticeable increase in the torque and horsepower just getting on the highway. I am anxious to see how much better my MPG will be

We've used a Pop-a-Plate in our kitchen at home for years, but just added one to our camper, along with this product and the Pop-a-Towel.  It's perfect - easy to install and a great space saver to hold the paper bowls and plates securely without using up any cabinet space.  I was a little worried that the flimsy paneling of the camper might make it less effective, but with the basic installation included it works just fine.  Love it!  Now we have all the basic essentials for meals at hand without using up the cabinets or having to dig anything out.

Easy to install, better to watch the video on YouTube from Spectre than the instructions that come with the cold air. Immediately noticed throttle response was improved and sounds like aftermarket exhaust was added. Too early to tell about improved gas mileage (you know it will help a little). This product is worth the bang for the buck!

UPDATE: 9 months later (see attached photos)I recently noticed that my tailgate was not locking so i opened the tailgate cover and found the issue.  The main piece that connects the actuator motor is PLASTIC!!!  Everything on thing works great but the whoever thought mating a plastic piece to a metal piece should be FIRED!  That plastic piece hooks onto the metal piece and when the key fob is use to lock and unlock, it pushes to disengage the lock and pulls to engage the lock.  Again, 9 months of push and pulling, plastic on metal.  What happens??? Of course the plastic piece will wear down and eventually slip off the metal piece because it has worn down to a smaller diameter.  So once worn, it slips off when pulling and once off it won't engage the lock.  I can still unlock because all it has to do is push but it's useless already.  The tailgate lock will still work if you manually use ur key to lock and unlock it just the connection point to lock and unlock via the key fob won't work.  The only permanent fix to this problem is to for the engineers to us a metal piece instead of a plastic piece and use an e-clip to secure it place. C'MON, $150+ and it doesn't even last over 9 month!!!!FYI on warranty: "Please Note: Pop & Lock Products purchased on auction sites such as Ebay, Amazon andCraigslist, to name a few, will not be covered under factory warranty under any circumstance."Very easy to install, instead of having the wire go all the way up to the engine bay, i had it go in the wires under the driver's seat up into the interior to the rear b-pillar, i just had to re-tape it with electrical tape and re-seed the rubber grommet .  I love how the lock codes to my vehicle key and that once wired it works with my key fob.  I've heard ppl complain about the quality of the mold not being thick enough and the tolerance of the key hole.  I use my key fob 99.99% of the time so i haven't used the key hole since coding the lock to my vehicle key.  The only minor issue is that the locking actuator is loud when locking and unlock.  Other than that, it's been great.  I've been very careful on opening the tailgate and just being cautious because of ppl's complaints about it's integrity of the handle (breaking).

When I opened the box, I could immediately see a hole of about .25" in diameter at the weld.  Very disappointing, as other reviewers have pointed out.  See the image I posted in the customer images section.The other welds are sloppy at best.Do not buy this product, the welds are absolutely terrible.

Surprisingly quite easy to apply and for such a small bottle, it provides great coverage and lasts. I am currently using this product on my wheels for a couple different vehicles to help tackle brake dust. One set of wheels is a paint mesh wheel with bare polished aluminum and the other is fully painted which I recently had restored. The one set of wheels have had to coating on for about a year and it's held up extremely well. Dirt and brake dust washes off with minimal effort and provides a high quality long last shine. Well worth the money! I will eventually be using this on paint, the vehicle just needs paint correction first.

If you don't want to spend a lot of money but want to get your vehicle hooked up with some lighting, this is a great start. I had to get an "add-a-fuse mini" and a 5-10amp mini fuse and a 18-22gauge ring terminal for the ground wire, but overall this was a great product. The cables were plenty long to run to the back seats even. I have a Toyota 4runner.

Lights are not easy to install due to poor design, needed to create own mount and add more wire. But they work extremely well in low light application. Surprisingly bright for such a small package. All in all the lights are very well built and the quality is good, it's just the mounting that's difficult. All in all good quality product, I'd still recommend them.  I have included some photos of how they look on my truck.I received this product free or discounted to review.  This is my honest unbiased opinion.

After only using the Cummins replacement filters my Husband stumbled on a recommendation of these Baldwin oil filters.So we bought them for each of our 1999 Dodge Ram trucks. One is a 2500 4x4 and the other is a 3500 4x4 with the Cummin's motor.These seem to be made very well, and made in the USA.They have more filtering holes and they are also less expensive than what we were paying.So far so good.I would recommend them and will continue to purchase these.I bought these at full price. My opinions are my own and I was not compensated in any way for my thoughts.I rely on product reviews just like others to help make my purchase decisions so I try each product very carefully before reviewing and always do my best to leave honest opinions  and provide as much facts as possible based solely on my experience.

Left little red fibers all over the interior of a brand new car. It did pick the dust up though however what's the point if it leaves strands of red cotton behind. I have a 15 year old full size duster that doesn't do that and never did. Maybe it was made on a Friday in china.

Works well but don't expect it to magically take away brake dust without some wiping/scrubbing. Compared to any other wheel cleaner I've used the smell is outstanding. Not saying I'd want an air freshener in this scent but at least it doesn't smell like carcinogenic chemicals. I have to drive 4 minutes to a car wash since there's no faucet out front of my townhouse complex. I have to spray down my wheels with water and wait a few minutes til they are cooler before I apply.

Black Jacket once again. I wear my jacket everyday, it's 4 years old and it was time to clean it up, so I washed it with saddle soap, let dry and tried this stuff out. My jacket turned black again, it was a shinny black, easy to use and great results. My jacket looks newish. I rather the company make a matte black formula as well but at least my jacket is black again. Photo is what it looked like vs what black jacket looks like

OK the are really nice mounts , heavy duty enough to even hold a 6" Daylighter SOLID on a tube. They ones I received only had ONE mounting screw? the instructions even said to tighten the SCREWS evenly? but there is only ONE on each mount? I guess they changed the design form two screws to only one  but didn't bother to update the directions LOL.They are somewhat bigger than I expected them to be ( hard to explain )they will hold a 1/2" diameter  light mount bolt -  but I will get some pics and post them here for all to seeStill a good mount, just kind of wish I could have got it in a polished STAINLESS to match my grill guard, but they do add to the overall look and give me a SOLID mount for more lights, right now I just have a set of KC driving/fog lights on them.UPDATE the more I look at them the more I am starting to dislike them - to bad it is going to COST me $6.00 from Amazon to send them back.FOLLOW UP - I decided to take them off and go with the original mounting plates for the KC SPorts  and seeing as it was going to cost me to send them back ( which kind of sucks )  I decided to keep the brackets for future use - they can be used for lights to be mounted anywhere there is a 1.25 tube and they can even be used to mount antennas or  flags on the top of my push bar also for parades.

I have been using this for my Evo X since the Evo guys' favorite, Carbone Lorraine/CL Brakes 325C DOT 4, became hard to get. I can tell you that this Red Line fluid has at least comparable properties of the amazing Carbone Lorraine brake fluid, and for that, you can't beat this price.The bottles are also quite full for the volume they promised. Three bottles gave me enough fluid to flush both the Evo's brakes and clutch.

My wiper is pin arm type. I looked on Amazon to verify before I bought this. This 14 inch should fit my Nissan Quest rear wiper (at least confirmed by Amazon). I am an inclined DIY but I do not know what is going on because I cannot install it. From looking at the instruction, it does support Pin Arm. But then I found problem: I am posting one picture what it should have and another one is what I received.The one with two hands is the correct one that I found on the internet, basically, it has 3 positions for the two pins, one is 1/4" and the other one is 3/16" depending on the pin size. The center position is for the blade.However, the 14 inch wiper blade that I receive has only one position for the blade but does not have the other two positions mentioned above (or in the other posted picture. So, it becomes un-installable since it cannot hold the pin regardless. By the way, the instruction printed on the cover shown the adapter does have 3 position like the correct one in the picture.I contacted the seller, but they refuse to accept return on an open item (doesn't matter what's wrong) and they do not pay for shipping. Since it is only a few dollars, I may have to just drop it in trash can.Please look at the pictures clearly as I do not make it up myself. If you do not agree with me, please let me know too because I am quite surprise why I could not install a simple wiper blade.

These are VERY bright. Put both in my 2009 Jeep Wrangler. The LED ones were a little bit smaller on the ends than the halogen ones but after bending the tabs in a little bit it worked just fine. They actually have a little heat sink with fins on the other side of the LEDs. I thought that was pretty cool.

These are tire covers, they do exactly what they are supposed to do. I just got mine so I can't say much on how long they will last, but they cover my tires perfectly. And the stap and buckle on the back side are a bonus to keep them tied tight around the tires.I am one of those people who have a camp trailer but live close to where I camp. That means my tires will sun-rot before I ever wear out the tread. I hate that. These tire covers are a much cheaper alternative than buying new tires before you even wear the tread out.My tires are 225 75R 15 so I had to find a tire conversion calculater online to get the correct size. Mine come to 28.3" tires. Some reviewers are saying to buy a size bigger. I bought the correct size and they fit perfect. I don't believe going bigger would be bad, but if they flap and move alot in the wind they may wear out faster than if they are snug on the tire.I also chose these covers for a special purpose. I have the BAL x-chocks on my trailer because my driveway is steep, so I needed a tire cover that would work with those. Search (BAL 28012 X-Chock Tire Locking Chock) if you don't know what those are. They go in between the tires which would be in the way of the tire cover. I installed the tire covers rotated just a little so that the bottom/edge can wrap around the x-chocks. This probably wouldn't work well without the strap, so that makes this tire cover the one for me. My tires are still fully covered and protected from the sun, and are very secure. I like them so much I ordered another set for my work trailer.I took a picture of the side of the box which shows all the tire sizes these will work with. I will post that picture on the product page for your reference.

Looks good and fit well on my 04 wrangler tj rubicon.  The flat black textured metal looks good and seems to be very sturdy, a much better and more durable coating than competing products from smittybilt or rugged ridge for sure.  My spare tire is a 33 inch tire with a heavy duty spare tire carrier and I can still swing my tailgate fully open, i just had to shave about a 1/4 inch off of the plastic on the carrier, not a big deal but anything bigger than a 33 you may run into trouble.  Since the bottom is open it gives the illusion you do not need to unplug the tail lights to install, This is false you most certainly need to unplug the light to install because the light can only slide in through the top, the bottom bar is too small for the light to pass through.  (If they made the bottom bar slighly bigger it would be a much easier installation).  You will need to buy bigger/longer hex screws to attach light to body after the guard is on, it would be nice if they included them.  Also my bars seemed to be at a very slight angle and not straight, a mundane detail and hard to notice at a quick glance but still I would prefer them to be perfect.  To install you need to remove the back part of your mudflap above the rear tire, the plug on the drivers side is very easy to access and will only take a few mins to install, the plug on the passenger side will take considerably longer, it is much harder to access and is often wedged up in an area you can barely see, i needed extra long plyers to fish it out.  In summary I still think they are one of the better rear light guards for the tj.

Great looking tonneau cover. Clips seem to be strong enough to last and are very adjustable for proper tension. When it's folded up you have more than half of the truck bed to load larger items that are too tall with the cover closed. It Is very secure while driving down the road or highway. The only reason I give it 4 starts is because at the front of the truck bed there was a 1/4 inch gap where water and air could enter. Luckily I had the seal I didn't use from my last truck that filled the gap. It does come with another seal but it shows that it is used for the tailgate end which I decided not to try at this time.

Plenty of positive reviews on this item, and I concur.  This is the second set of Nerf Bars I have purchased from Amazon for a total savings of close to $1000 over manufacture bars.  As others have mentioned easy to install with minor tool or mechanical knowledge, look great, sturdy and slip resistant. Plenty of finished pics already uploaded so I included a generic pic of the C-Clips you will receive which is how the brackets mount to the truck with brief installation tips below...Under the truck on the chassis side rail you will notice several black plastic caps covering holes.  Working from front to back you will remove the first, second and fourth sets of 4 caps, leaving the third position capped as those holes are not used.  You now have 4 open holes at each bracket position.  The C-Clip slides onto one hole with the female receptacle now seated over the second.  You will use 2 C-Clips at each station which provides the anchor point for the mounting bolts.  This all becomes self explanatory once you get under the truck and visually inspect.  Mount all 6 brackets loosely at first.  Next, the kit includes plastic fascia pieces which will cover the visible portion of the brackets when viewing from beside truck; affix using the provided plastic plugs and screws.  Then mount the nerf bars on the brackets, sliding and positioning as needed and leaving them loose until all are installed. 'TYGER' should be readable on the skid steps as you face the vehicle; if it's upside down you have the wrong bar.  Once each bar is completely secured with loose bolts you will be able to slide it towards or away from the truck about an inch or so.  Find your desired location and have somebody hold in place while you tighten all the bolts.  Repeat on other side.  Finally go back under truck and tighten bracket mount bolts.  You are done in under an hour.  Two people makes it easier, but can be done by yourself in a pinch.  Use blue Loctite (not included) on all bolts as there will be significant vibration during the life of the brackets and bars.

This solved all my ignition problems!I have a modified Pontiac 400 that requires a specific timing curve that is hard to obtain with weights and springs. My first distributor was professionally curved, a Pertronix Flamethrower. It worked great at first, but one day it started retarding the timing rather than advancing when rpm's increased. I never put 300 miles on the car and the $$$ distributor was junk. I temporarily put a Cardone distributor in with light springs to get by until I came up with another solution (MSD locked out distributor with this MSD 6AL2 programmable ignition box).Tip: Lock out your distributor and use the built-in software to set your timing curve! You can set starter cranking timing so it's not so hard on the starter turning over your high compression engine. I set 16 degrees between 0-500 rpm. Remember the software you set the retard, so think in terms of setting your timing all-in, then work backwards with the software.You can read my full review by searching your favorite search engine for "mods and rods tv MSD 6aL2", should take you to my blog post which includes pictures and more suggestions.

LOVE IT! So much more solid than my previous one. Thankfully I already had a 3" headlight extension, otherwise bullets would have interfered with fairing. Stock bulbs are very yellow though. Plan to replace them.

I placed these on the front turn signal of my '16 FRS. They look great in person and do the job.So far all the lights I've bought from Sirius have been great.One guy chased me down to give me a high five and some random girl came up and gave me her number.None of that happened before these lights.

I swapped my interior bulbs and dash with LED's.This is what my s10 dash uses to hold bulbs.Could've used my factory locks. But this was easy and painless to install since I didn't have to undo old bulbs n then insert New LED's

I got this portable air compressor to test out. It's actually very loud (not a bad thing). I was surprised and shocked when I plugged it in because I wasn't expecting it to be on. I think my employee tried playing with it and left it in the on position. Anyways, once I plugged into the battery,  it worked really well. I didn't get to test it on my wheel but I did test it on some pressurized tanks that needed to be pumped. It was fairly fast and easy to use. I like that it has a screw on plug feature especially since this cord is so short. The compressor cord is literally 4 inches long. I guess size matters lol. I received this item for a honest review

This knob is advertised as 207g but weighs in at just a hair over 138g. My stock WRX knob weighs just over 204g. If you are looking for a nice replacement at the same/similar weight, look elsewhere.

I am impressed with the quality of this intake. It looks really nice as well. The walls of the intake itself or a lot thicker than the stock one which is kind of flimsy. It seems like it would insulate from the heat a lot better than the stock on. It seems to be working well. I cant tell if the MPGs Went up or not but I would think so. Its one of those things where you can say why not buy it. It even came with extra gaskets for the sensors which is nice.

I was so excited to use the RED version when i had good results with the BLUE. The blue did 90% of what clay can do without hassle. Expecting RED to as good as clay. Prep the passenger door panel lube the F out of it. Lube the RED. Did a quick pass on the panel. No grab just slide. Similar to BLUE. It grabs if not enough lube is used. Wipe it down and my jaw dropped. It destoyed the clear coat. The whole panel was left in a white haze. It doesnt wipe off. The clear coat have been hazed over. I was so pissed. I tried some McGuire polish on a small part and it polished out. Now i have to get the car paint corrected. Pics is of the clear coat on door after and of the other driver door on how the paint was before. Amazon should pay for my paint correction...;(

We purchased these for the main overhead lighting of our 5th wheel trailer (6 dual fixtures in all). These work perfect and are a little brighter than the  incandescent bulbs they replaced. These have 12v-28v variable voltage which is a must in RV 12v applications. After much trial and error and purchasing some bulbs on Amazon that say 12v only and finding out that they will get hot when voltage fluctuates above 12v as in your RV, I have found the variable voltage replacements (we have many different Styles and sizes-35 bulbs total) to operate with no noticeable heat generation at all. I purchased these bulbs also: (Grv T10 921 24-3528 SMD LED Super Bright warm white pancake type) for our auxiliary overhead lighting such as bathroom, shower and under cabinet applications and we feel these work great for those areas. We have purchased several barrel type LEDs for various sconces and over the table lights from Ebay, from China as I only found the variable voltage barrel types(921 and 1140) there. These were very inexpensive but it does take a little longer to get them. I did buy some of these bulbs that I have reviewed on Ebay which were identical for less than 1/2 the cost. I hope this helps some of you that are considering LEDs for your RV. I should mention too that we have absolutely no TV interference with any of these replacement led bulbs that we have purchased.

These joint sockets are great and seem quite durable. I typically use them on my 3/8" and 1/4" drive ratchets. I have found that they perform well even at the higher torques on my 3/8" ratchet. I have not had the need to use the 1/2" drive joint socket yet but it is physically bigger than the 3/8" joint socket and seems like it would hold up to higher torques.The joint sockets range in length from about 1.5" to 2.5".Pros:*Holds up to higher torques*Coating is durableCons:*None so farAdditional Considerations:These sockets only offer 1/2" -> 1/2", 3/8" -> 3/8", or 1/4" -> 1/4". Be aware you may need a separate socket in order to have the size drive you want on either side of this socket. (i.e. 1/2" -> 3/8")Overall: 5/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 5 starsIf you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

Nice piece of steel.  Only four stars for two reasons:The black piece of steel is perforated and they mount it with the smooth side up.  This is going for be slippery when wet. If perforated in the other direction it would give some gription when stepped on.As mentioned in other reviews, it could use a better non-rattle method.  I used a composite material wedge on the top of the unit to help control movement.  I don't think the device they include would do the job by itself.  After putting in the wedge I put on the device and used thread lock to make sure that it doesn't go anywhere.  It still had side to side play that I will need to address at some point.The pluses are that this thing is great looking and you can really make it stick out from the bumper if you like.  I chose to bring it in closer so that it's not a knee banger.

Different Mounting hardware than shown in ad!Disappointed to say the least. I have not hooked them up yet to see how bright they are. I am sure that they are going to be fine. However, I did not get exactly what is pictured and described in the ad. I ordered the 2pcs 18w Spot Beam. The picture in the ad of this item has an entirely different mounting bracket than the bracket that I received. The picture shows the bracket extending a good 1 or so below the lamp fixture with 4 attachment screws and a large mounting screw. The bracket that came to me had only 2 screws and the bracket mounts tight to the lamp fixture.See attached picture of item that I received. Note entirely different mounting bracket.

I used this to wire LED lights on my Can-Am ATV. No instructions come with this at all. It comes with two plugs you can use to attach to your lights and they will connect to the harness. It was a little tricky trying to figure out a way to secure the pins in the plug but I was able to figure it out. All wires are heavy duty and in a protective wrap. The wires were much longer than I expected which was a good thing. I ran the power directly to the battery which is at the far rear of the atv near the exhaust. The included switch was easy to install in the dash. When in the on position the switch has a small red light which comes on to indicate the power is on. While this has two light plugs I spliced in a third with no problem. Even though it lacked directions I still have to give it 5 stars as the quality is much better than expected.

Works great. Using on a '08 Silverado 4.8 with a 22 foot 4100lb trailer with a 525lb. tongue weight. Really notice the difference in pulling,stopping and a much smoother ride then with just a plain hitch. Not to difficult to set up. Have not used the sway bar as I have no swaying issue. Glad I got the 800lb model as I have found that going way to far over your tongue weight will not allow the bars to flex properly.

Unfortunately, this battery box was far less than described.The sidewall on the long side was collapsed inward; making the box next to impossible to open.I tried to bend the sidewall outward, but it just would return to its original shape over time.Every time I would attach the lid, I could not release the locking tab without using a screwdriver to pry it apart.The side that was not deformed released without any difficulty.Perhaps this is a one-off defect; I don't know.However, based solely upon my onetime experience with this item, I cannot make a positive recommendation.See PictureNot recommended.

Great Seat covers.  I received this Oxford 17pc set Cloth Mesh Auto seat covers at a discounted rate for my honest unbiased review or the seat covers and they are working out great.  I received the package with all items included and in a plastic zippered package.  The set comes with everything you need.  Included are front seat covers, head rest covers, steering wheel cover, seat belt covers or pads, and back bench seat cover.  The seat covers for the front come with a top piece and a bottom piece making it fit nice and not to tight and stretched to were the covers don't even touch the seat like others do.  The head rest covers fit nice and snug and make the whole set come together.  There are even spots for side buttons like my SUV or seat belt if they are attached to the seat.  The back set fit nicely and my whole SUV is looking great.  I love the blue accent so that it is not just plain black, bringing so color pop into it.  These are working out nicely and looking great in my truck.  I really like them a lot.  I purchased these because I have leather seats and they are still in good conditioner but are hot and your skin sticks to them in the summer, so I was looking for a set to keep me from getting stuck to the seat and hurting my skin and they are working nicely.  I would recommend this set especially with all the extras it comes with and the quality so far it has no noticeable wear or does not look like it will rip.  I am going to pst some more pictures of the actual truck but the sun was so bright it was just giving me pictures with sun glare, so I will try to get some good one for you and post an update with pictures of the seats.

I own a roadside assistance service business in the Midwest and these Jump 'n' carry by "Clore automotive" power packs have never failed, within the hottest & coldest of circumstances.A must have for the professional & novice road warriors alike.I've purchased the next generation battery technology of jump start units by Clore automotive, through the purchase of two JNC770G & one JNC8800 one JNC318Note: Old fashioned jumper cables are simply obsolete and outright dangerous too new vehicles, vs these state of the art self contained power pack units becoming the future standard of all "powerhouse" Jumper boxes. With their reverse polarity alarm light & siren, voltage read & feedback protection, self charging, etc.Don't be fooled by the ridiculous amperage claims by other so-called competitors, as you'll only waste your money also honestly look rather stupid. By trying or buying some of the knockoffs out there, as JNC is absolutely the king of quality & dependability hands down.

I installed this on my 2016 Polaris RZR XP 4 1000.To install I also had to purchase an LED light bar wiring harness which was ten dollars. Installation was very simple especially because I already had the wiring harness (power bus?) installed that brings power from the battery to front (under hood).Tools required were a 5/16" drill bit, drill, 9/16" socket and ratchet, and the Allen wrench which was included in the hardware bag for the light bar..I installed the light bar on my roof as it seemed to provide the most spread from there.The light bar itself seems very sturdy. I'm curious to see how it holds up in weather and on rough, dusty, muddy, etc terrain.It really did make a huge difference once I took it out for a spin on my back yard trail!I'll be purchasing another one of these for my RZR (I'll find some where you stick it) and one for my truck.In my pics, you can see a stock head light pic and a pic with stock head lights and led bar. The pics don't do justice!

I installed this adapter on my 06' Wolfpack 34' toy hauler (which weighs just under 12,000lbs) a few weeks ago and I love it! The instillation took about 2 hours due to having to drill holes in the pin box to keep the adapter from spinning, but the offset is definitely worth it. I have a full size rigid tool box in the back of my truck that extends to within 5" of the gooseneck.  The offset allows me to turn 70 degrees without having to worry about the 5th wheel hitting the cab or toolbox. I installed the Reese Towpower 4448 Gooseneck Fold-Down Rail mounting system on my 2015 F-250 Power Stroke  and could not be happier.

I will give it a five if it fit  on my car but because of the rotors are different my originals on the car were half-inch  if your rotors look like these on the picture and not planning on buying new calipers do not get them. If you're buying new calipers buy the whole kit from power stop  .

Worked well on Chevy Cobalt to bleed brakes. Bottle is perfect size, if it were too big you risk draining too much brake fluid and need to run to a shop to get more. Magnet was able to hold the empty bottle, but its a good idea to rest the bottom on top of the rotor to avoid spills. Reviewing almost after a year and brakes are working well so it (and I) did the bleeding job well.

2014 grand cherokee -  PROS - The 10 and 2 position ridged pads are a nice touch, and not as prominent in real life as depicted in the photos.Cons - As mentioned in other reviews, I wish there was a bit more wrapping around the already fat JEEP steering wheel, silicone backing helps to hug the wheel nicely though.The perforated White accent inlays are slightly skewed...to me that is a reflection of working with leather material, and not mass machine produced. One black thread pulled out and frayed at the end, but looks like it can be trimmed, or the cover reversed.

These do NOT fit correctly on classic Blitz brand gas cans.The original breather (vent) caps have a ridge on them so they firmly snap in and out. When you open the cap they don't pop off.These JSP manufacturing ones are smooth so the slide into the hole fine, but pop right off when you try and open the cap.

Quick and easy install (quick delivery too - gotta love Prime).  Applied per directions, cleaned the door sills with windex type spray.  The tape is STICKY - you get one chance to make it right.  Tight fit, passenger door requires more of a tug to close now but no wind or whistling - solid seal. Put in about 2 months ago - no leaks (air or water).  Really like how they look on the Jeep. Great product for the price, highly recommend.

Great design!!! Comfy and snug fit! using the built-in visor with my sunglasses cuts the wind like butter!!! The wide over-the-ear straps cover my Bluetooth earphones well and shields it from blowing around in the wind up to 65mph. I also love that the chin strap is short and has a button at the end to prevent it from smacking you in the face at high speeds. All in all, great helmet. The only negatives are mostly cosmetic...by the picture it looked matte black but it is actually shiny/gloss black and should be mentioned in the description...not a big deal but to the main issue, the large HJC in the front of the helmet is horrific why would they do that?? I bought a cheap sticker from cycle gear to attempt to cover it up. Also the helmet is pretty bulky for a half-helmet. Either way, I would definitely recommend this helmet!

I have always had a hard time when trying to back up. I am so short and it makes it hard to be able to see over the back of the seats to back up and have been wanting to get blind spot mirrors for awhile now to help me out. It came with four, two inch mirrors that just stick onto the side mirrors on my car. The mirrors are really easy to install and just fit in the bottom hand corner of my mirror. I will say the mirrors do not seem to be very thick like some I have seen before. I put two on my vehicle and two on my husbands so now no matter what car I drive I know backing up is going to be easier for me. With the mirrors I am able to check completely around the car so there is a lot smaller chance that I will hit anything. I am really glad I decided to go ahead and get these Blind Spot Mirrors. I received this product at a discount to test and review. This review is solely my opinion. The information I provided is what I experienced.

I used these bags for about a year now and find them to be very suitable for the price.  They mount pretty simply, but don't fit perfectly as you might expect from a universal bag.  Getting the straps right can be a little interesting, but, again, it's a universal bag.  The material seems durable, but gets marked up easily.  The fastek clips are sometimes hard to line up, which is annoying.  They are definitely big...very big.  But fit lots of gear, which is a good thing.These bags have a lot of space.  I purchased some small, square trash cans from Wally world, cut the lip off, and they fit right in.  That helps alot with keeping the shape I want and easy loading/unloading.I haven't had any issues with the velcro straps which go over the seat, but they don't appear to be very durable or strong.  I wouldn't be surprised if they failed in another year or so.My bike was hit and the bike slid down the road on the right side bag (see pic).  It didn't take as bad as I would have expected.  About a 15 foot slide.Purchased mine new for under a hundred here on the big A.

Overall, I'm pleased with the performance of this set. For trailers under 80" wide, each unit has side marker lights, and the driver's side has white LED's for illuminating the license plate. For regular running lights, two LED's light up in each light unit and the remaining ones light up for braking/signals. Each side marker light has one LED, and all are very bright.The set includes a 25' wiring harness with both male and female connectors for attaching to the tow vehicle, and each unit can be side- or rear-mounted. The instructions included are clearly illustrated and easy to follow, and all necessary hardware is included such as license plate bracket, crimp connectors, wire nuts &  clips, nuts & bolts and ring connectors for grounding.There are a couple drawbacks to the design of these however. I would have liked to see a little heavier gauge wire on the connectors and light units. It doesn't seem that the ground wire especially will hold up over time at its connection to the trailer frame, and the leads coming from each light unit should be heavier gauge. For that reason, I ran an extra self-provided ground wire directly from the vehicle connector to each light unit and soldered the connections to assure a good and durable contact.Another problem I faced that may not be an issue on other trailers was that I had to modify the mounting bracket on my trailer because of the slanted angle of the top of each light case. Because of the angle, to fit in the original trailer mounting holes, the lights would have pointed at an angle toward the ground. So to keep them pointing straight back, I had to add a small piece of angle aluminum to mount the lights at the proper orientation (see picture in customer photos on the main product page). Just check your mounting location before you buy.Overall, despite the drawbacks I mentioned, I feel that this is a good light set for the price, and I found them locally for only $39 per set.

I purchased this headset for $40.  I was able to test this out with another SCS ETC Headset, as well as a friend using his Sena 10S.  The three of us had trouble trying to link all three headsets/intercoms, however we were able to link the SCS's to one-another, as well as the Sena to one of the SCS's; we could not for the life of us figure out how (if it was even possible) to link all three units so we could all three use the intercom.  I used this for a combined 8 hours (averaging) and the unit still states the battery is "above 50%." The intercom sound quality was great on mine, up until about 60+ mph.  Above 60mph, the sound seemed to get staticky and/or would break-up a little.  My friend, however, said he could hear me fine up until about 80mph+.  When we were both at 100mph+ the intercom was rather useless (couldn't make out anything clearly, and the sound was breaking up too much).I only used the Bluetooth feature for a little bit. I tested a phone call, and although the caller could hear me well, I had to max out the volume on the SCS, and could barely make out what the caller was saying (unless I was at a stop, or moving very slowly).  I'm not going to kill the review because of this, since I haven't had chance to try more calls, and play with settings between my phone and the SCS headset.  I also could use the provided spacers to have the headset ear pieces closer to my ears.  I'm sure this would help at least a little bit. I didn't get this with the intention of taking phone calls, so I'm not too worried about this.  I also got to use the Bluetooth for the audio from my phone to the SCS/headset.  The sound was decent; better when stopped at red lights versus moving. The wind noise from riding (all speeds) affects the sound quality, and clarity.Again, for $40, I'm impressed with the battery life, as well as the simplicity in using the unit.  It was great being able to chat with a friend while riding, especially for longer cruises and road trips.  I wish we could've gotten it to synch with all three units (another SCS and the Sena 10S), but I still think it's a great bang for the buck.

This fuel door is a nice customization I was able to add to my 2008 Expedition within an hour, using patience and being careful.( I added pictures of my project to the product images for reference.) There are two style options for this truck; the 6950, which you're looking at right now, and the 6050 which is more of the Steve McQueen "Bullitt" type with the torx screws all around the edge of the door ring ( I believe it's also called racing style)  I decided the 6950 had a more finished and retro look, and I didn't want to display any pretense of being a seeker of dueling with a Tundra or Silverado at any stop lights! As for having time to install it;  I'm a dad of four who has little time for the truck to be out of commission under the auspices of being "worked on" solely for appearance additions, so I needed this thing to go on without hauling out an arsenal of power tools.The nuts and bolts used for attaching this fuel door to the body of the vehicle are extremely small, and the fuel door area even smaller! There is also a thin opening just inside the right hand side of the fuel door area where, if you don't pack in a paper towel, the tiny nuts and washers will fall down and be lost in between the body and the lower rear quarter panel fascia.  (Seems more like a technical manual right now, doesn't it?)  The instructions are bare-bones, and require you to take a moment to engage your common sense:  test-fit items like the striker pin that needs to be adjusted BEFORE it gets screwed onto the car's body.The main trouble is an extremely tight working space and little crevasses that you only find when the nut and washers seem to disappear like magic when dropped in the very shallow fuel door cavity. Pertaining to the two all-thread posts that actually secure the door and outer ring to the body- my posts had to be "finessed" into the holes, as the hole were just the slightest bit farther apart than the posts were positioned on the piece.  Again, patience and a firm, even application of pressure, and the posts were able to be coaxed in without stripping the threads. You will be adjusting the door's "even-ness" (that's not a real word, is it?) against the body of the truck by turning two set-screws that are only accessed by removing the door you just coaxed into the holes that were just a bit too wide, but are now learning to live with a little bit of "expansion".To sum it up;  a bit aggravating and a test of my already short patience? Yes indeed-y! Need to take out any tools besides a screw driver and a torx head driver? Nope!  Does the expedition now stand out from the others in a subtle, yet stylish (in a manly) manner as well? Heck yeah! I hope this "map of the minefield" of installing this 6950 billet door helps you in your pursuit of adding a custom touch to your Expedition!

Years ago I used to use Meguiars three step cleaner, polish, wax system.  Like EVERY other month!  I put so much wax on (monthly) that it almost looked like it had a layer of plastic on the paint. Still, I pretty much try everything, relentlessly looking for best.I looked for "the best" and for the longest time (10 years) I was using Zano regularly - which is pretty much pure gloss and bullet proof protection from everything including sun.  (Klasse is too).  The problem is that there was no polish in it (Zaino have a one step cleaner wax now).  Using that in the California sun, my exterior (used it on everything outside) was UV protected so there was no sun wear.  It is awesome stuff and worth every penny.  I recommend it for new paint - especially if you have a garage and can put 5 coats on over a couple days.  You have to apply it by hand though.  Klasse's All in One is about as awesome as well (can't layer that, but they have a topper sealant glaze for layers).  Both have an amazing, very noticeable gloss.  People *will* notice.Over time (I'm talking 15 years here) your paint starts to haze some even with coatings of the best wax.  You HAVE to polish it.  Claying alone can't clean scratches, swirls and haze but it will feel "smooth" like polishing alone cannot accomplish.  It will look pretty shiny with Zano or Klasse (or any good "modern" synthetic) on aged paint but it's not the same as "polished" paint. But those sealants won't remove scratches or swirls, only fill them in (which is good too, if you want to do that forever).  As I get older, I find that doing the three step method BY HAND is just too exhausting.  I get sore now.  In fact, I take a couple aspirin right after or before I wash and wax the cars now.  And to do two cars over a weekend.....  Takes me hours to recoup my energy for the rest of the day.So I bought a random orbital polisher.  Gees, I wish I had done that decades ago.  It's the ONLY way to polish (polishing is abrading and it is WORK on the paint) and it's also pretty great for applying a THIN layer of synthetic protectant and not missing any spots.  I bought a porter cable sander, then another random orbit specifically for polishing boats.  I was tired of cleaning out wood dust to polish my cars, that's why I bought the dedicated polisher.  I also bought an orbital polisher from Harbor Freight hoping to do it the way the "professionals" do.  There is a reason pros use an orbital, but a random orbit is fine.  Just takes longer.  A random orbit is more physical work to operate.  It does a more aggressive job (faster), but it also wants to bounce and grab all over the place as the polishes dry.  It takes work to hold it in place.  A random orbit does not do that.  It just "sands" the surface and the pad spins a little (don't press too hard and stop the spinning) - mostly staying in place vibrating your hands like crazy.I have found that Meguiar's Ultimate Compound is a great, mild way to aggressively clean and smooth paint (not to mention oxidation, but I've never had that on my paint).  Their 105 is supposed to me more aggressive.  If your paint is more than 5 years old, I'd use Ultimate on your paint.  It won't over compound.  Amazing stuff.  Very gentle but killer effective.  If you polish your paint a lot, try the milder polish route first to see if it works okay.I tried Meguiar's Ultimate Polish, but it's a little wanting.  It didn't noticeably polish the paint - even with a random orbital.  Didn't try it with my more aggressive orbital.  It might be okay on haze free paint, but I didn't have that.  I bought some of their 205 (similar to Ultimate Polish) which is the professional follow up version to their 105 (similar to Ultimate Compound) but I haven't used it yet.I did find a ONE STEP 4-in-1 cleaner, polish, glaze, sealant from Mark Supply in Venice, Florida. That is amazing stuff, but it still didn't remove my haze completely.  I does look great, awesome actually, on good condition paint and it's sooooo easy to use.  It really does it all in one shot.  Most people would opt for a product like this.  It's the easiest way to get a great finish.  On then off and you're done (I always use quick detailer as a final touch).  Then I put their Red Velvet Wax over it as a "topper" but you don't have to.  Looks great.  But there is still better.  I needed to get rid of the haze.  It's something you really only see when you really, really look at the sun reflecting in the paint.  Hurts your eyes due to brightness.  Mere humans don't even notice, they think the paint "looks like brand new".  A good pro can see it right off.  Too, they'll charge you $300+ to compound it out.Since I love synthetic sealers, I did put some of Mark Supply's 39 Polymer Sealant over Mother's glaze.  That synthetic sealer is amazing.  The vehicle very noticeable glows. The paint almost looks wet.  It's actually quite thick, like the other sealants I mentioned from Mark Supply.  Still, when looked at the sun reflecting in the paint, the fiery ball wasn't a solid edge.  ...Haze.  Really shiny though.Since I've used Mothers products (FX and Reflextions) in the past (they are good and LOVE their spray wax), I wanted to try their Micro Polishing Glaze with my orbital (if you have a random orbit, that will work as well, just slower).  WOW.  What a difference!  Haze finally gone (I did it with a white Chemical Guys pad on my orbital).  It might work by hand on clean paint, but a machine application is soooooo much easier.  I find that the pad starts to "gunk up" toward the end and jump a lot.  Rather than fight with it, I suggest you use two pads - one clean one for each half of the vehicle.  Your results may vary.THIS STUFF MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE PAINT SHINE.  You will care if you are a nut about results.I was worried that it would break up the wax/sealant to paint bonding but it seems to be durable enough.  I have put Meguiar's Ultimate Wax (sealant) over this and that is awesome.  I have put Klasse's High Gloss Sealant Glaze over this (can't use a cleaner wax, it will strip it off) and it's awesome as well.  I have used Mark Supply (Venice, FL) 39 Polymer Sealant over this and the vehicle glows as with Meguiars or Klass Sealant Glaze.  Still haven't figure out which one stays cleaner in the long run between washes.  All of these look awesome on my 15 year old white toyota paint and our 10 year old graphite Lexus paint.  I have also used Duragloss over this.  Ditto, amazing.  If you use a quick detailer after washing the vehicle the paint will glow and look like brand new. freshly waxed paint with all of these.  The only issue would be long term durability and which stays cleaner over time.  I haven't use Zaino over this, but it would probably be doubly amazing.  The synthetics should last from 6 months to a year for protection but I never wait that long to reseal.  I love a slippery to the finger finish.  Wax last 3 or 4 months in hot sun.I don't know if Meguiar's 205 would polish like this glaze (using a random orbit or orbital), but you will be very happy using this stuff under your finishing wax.  It does get a bit gummy as it dries with a machine.  Man, does it polish and shine though!  Applied thinly, it's easy to wipe off with a microfiber.  Might need a squirt with a quick detailer to get 100% off.  I don't bother since applying wax with a machine takes any residue off.I mentioned "world class" products here because I'm a nut at doing "the best".  If you want optimum/maximum paint shine use Meguiars Ultimate Compound (or 105) under this (with a machine).  Then use this - hopefully with a machine.  By hand works, I did it for decades when my body was younger.  Machine is faster and I just use foam pads so I can't possibly ruin my paint.  Start with Orange (or white) with the compound, then White with glaze/polish, then Black to finish with sealant/wax.Zaino, Klasse, Meguiar's Ultimate Wax, Duragloss or Mothers FX on top of this will be pretty awesome.  If you are a real nut you can put several coats of wax over synthetic sealers for depth plus a bullet proof base.  On white paint, gloss only matters, you'll never see depth of finish like you will with multiple layers on colored paints.Hope you find this helpful.  I have hours and hours investing in finding what works best.  (And I never stop looking.)  Use a wax/sealant with UV protection and also use a finishing quick detailer with UV protection when washing the vehicle.  The paint will look like brand new to most people for the next 15-20 years.

These Spark plug wires are a perfect fit for my 2002 Chevy avalanche 5.3 v8. I purchased these because they are what came on the truck from the factory and the old ones lasted 170,000 miles and were probably still ok but i thought it was a good time to do a tune up.i also used the ACDelco Iridium spark Plugs. a great combination i should be good for another 150,000 miles

Just what I needed to run a combo  RCA/power cable under my Travel Trailer.  They grabbed right on to the frame perfectly.  I do wish they came in different sizes for the wire.  It was a little tight, but I made it work.  In the first photo it looks like the wire might fall out, but that is from under the unit and my camera did some weird with the orientation so it's actually sticking up.

I got this to install on some of my cars interior panels. Its an older car, so most of the panels are flat.  This wrap has a 3M adhesive on the back to keep it in place. I did several small pieces first a couple weeks ago. Theyve stayed in place nicely so far. No bubbles or peeling of the edges. I did have an issue wrapping the corners of the pieces, but I think it was just me and not the wrap. I like the texture of this wrap, giving it a more expensive feel over just plain vinyl. I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own, and I always update my review if my opinion about a product ever changes.

The funnel in this unit is worth the price of the who drain container unit.I don't use the container, anymore.  I use a used one gallon used squat one gallon orange container.  It fits under the emgine area with plenty of room to spare, when the car is on ramps. It captures most all the oil from the filter change, and the filter can be allowed to drain into the bottle, after you slide the assembly from under the car.  Walmart, unlike most auto parts stores, keeps the container.  I left the black container with them, when it became full.  But I kept the funnnel.After the fill the Go-Jo bottle, I transfer the oile to another bottle that I can discard.  It screws onto the top of most antifreeze or cheap windshield washer bottles.  You don't even need the drain container.I use the large funnel often for transferring all sorts of liquids into plastic bottles without spilling the liquid.This is one super funnel.

I put this between the parking brake handle and the passenger seat in my Suzuki Samurai.  It is a perfect fit. It does move back and forth a bit, but I am planning to put some velcro on the bottom to prevent it from sliding around on the carpet.  Once can use screws to mount it, but I would prefer not to do that.

Fit perfectly and color matched way better then I thought for a 100$ spoiler. The posting indicates a SS replica but I think its more of a Z28 replica.  The only issue I had was that it came with the hard plastic guides not the flimsy paper ones.  and since this is a lip type spoiler it was difficult to sit the spoiler flat while taping them down.  But after cutting some of the guides I was able to put it on pretty easily.  Still didn't take away from the final result which looks factory without spending 500+

They were hard to get on but once I did they are solid and work great. The peices that go up against the car were angled wrong and I had to bend them by hitting them with a hammer, and the clips kept sliding off when I tightened it. You just have to work with it and try a bunch of different positions till you find a good spot. But after about 2 hours I got them to work.

This kit worked for my particular application. I gave it 3 stars for the reasons stated below:1) Kit does not come with instructions. Therefore, you will need to research how to assemble this connector or already have the experience. There is a helpful review on this page with instructions.2) The silicone plugs for "waterproofing" do not fit snuggly in the rear of the connector. It is extremely easy to push them too far into the connector or have the push out.3) The red insert that holds the pins in place may require trimming to get it to fit properly.4) The connector is challenging to plug in. If you are using this connector; make sure it's at an easily accessible area when plugging in.On a positive note however, from this price point, this is the best connector you can buy. Even considering the issues I experienced above; at the end of the day the connector goes together and does it's job. I used this on a snowmobile and have not had any issues since assembly.Hope this helps!

Love these tires! Bought a set for my sons jeep 5 weeks ago and he's put 2500 miles on them and they've been perfect, I will be buying a set for my jeep when it needs them. Very little road noise and they do great in the rain. UPDATE: I've had these tires over a year now and they are still a great tire, they are wearing great and still look great. I've not had a single problem with them and definitely will buy them again.

I got this for my first gen chevy volt. It Barely fits...but my main issue is it is NOT "solar reflective" as it shows in pictures and lists in info. It IS sun absorbing as it claims not to be. So maybe they sent me the wrong cover but not worth hassle of returning probably just to ship the same cover again. It also came with no antenna hole patch....If i had known what this cover was and wanted this type of (dust cover really) I would've just got a better one from costc* for less.UPDATE 5.3.18The above described cover lasted less than three month in extremely mild weather (Phoenix feb, march, april) then turned to powder on the inside, flaking apart on outside.I contacted the seller, provided photos, and they quickly sent me another cover. This one however is the silvery type depicted in the product listing that I was expecting the first time. I'm not expecting it to last long, but I wanted to give the seller props for responding in a professional manner.

Cannot praise these bulbs enough.  They are bright as can be, a perfect match for my HIDs, color temperature is a great match.  I have the same bulbs (but with a different socket) on my truck, and they match the LED headlights I put in that vehicle.  Attached is a picture of my MX-5 with LED driving lights (center, top, next to the grille,) HID low beams (top, outside,) and the driver's side (bottom right in picture) is this bulb, and opposite it is the original halogen.It is difficult to tell in the picture unless you look carefully, but these LEDs are much brighter and produce a much cleaner (cooler) light than the halogens they replaced.  Speaking of "cool" - they do not generate much heat at all.  I touched the glass lens on the fog lights, and the LED was cool to the touch, the glass lens in front of the halogen was hot enough to cook an egg.Unfortunately, for the purposes of picture-taking, it was not possible to turn the fog lamps on without the headlights turned on without completely unplugging everything else, so again, you have to look closely at the picture to tell the difference.  As I stated in other reviews of the same bulbs with different sockets for other vehicles, they simply must be seen to be believed.Everyone I've shown these bulbs to has been completely blown away, and I've helped several friends to bring their vehicles up-to-date on lighting - find your exact socket and order these lights that fit - these 144 SMD LEDs are unbeatable.

These are great fog lights for my '03 GMC Sierra Denali. Very easy to install. Simple upgrade from my stock Halogen fog lights. Better light output for sure. You can see the difference in the attached pic of the new L.E.D. version on the left versus the old yellowish Halogen on the right. I also attached a night shot too. I highly recommend these bulbs.

This mirror is an excellent fit for my BMW 2-Series (see attached pic), so if you (like me) are upset that BMW deleted blind-sot monitoring this year for the 2-series, then this mirror is for you.  The mirrors are real glass, are right & left-handed (another big plus), and can be mounted on either side to match the curvature of your mirror.  These also include pre-installed 3M automotive grade double-faced tape, and the mirrors can be moved up & down slightly after mounting to customize your view, but no side-to-side adjustment is possible (you'll just have to move your mirror).  I can definitely recommend this mirror set.

I absolutely love this helmet. The transition shield is one of the coolest features on the market. I also like the fact that this helmet has built-in speaker pockets. Sena makes a Bluetooth kit specifically for this helmet but I decided to bypass it. I mounted my SMH5-02 low profile on this helmet. I would recommend taping the Bluetooth port of from the inside of the helmet to cut down on wind noise. Also, if you are not going to purchase the kit I recommend leaving the plastic peice on that the Bluetooth module mounts to. This also helps eliminate wind noise. Over time, the shield can become very hard to clean. My biggest gripe with this helmet is the size of the devil on the back. None of the picture give you a good idea of how big it is. I decided to cover it up with stickers. Overall, this is a great helmet. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality unit. You can't go wrong with Bell.

Installed on a 2001 Tahoe LS. After searching on YouTube for videos, you just basically pry the tabs back and pop old mirror off. The sole purpose I ordered mirror was because my heater didn't work on the passenger side. The 1st pic is a side-by-side of old and new, new on the left. I have heard a lot of complaints about the glass vibrating above 45 mph, so I was sure to save the little gasket and transfer it to the new mirror.(Pic 2) Take your time and do this right! (Pic 3) Now, for the PITA part. It seems as the old heater clips are much smaller than the tabs on the new mirror (Pic 4) So I had to buy some 16 gauge wire clips and crimp them on (Pic 5 is what I used) Pressing back on is easy and then you're done! I wore gloves so I didn't have to clean mirror because I'm smart like that! :)After the unexpected delay, the mirror looks great, heats up, and I'm happy! 4 starts for the connectors not being the right size. I can't believe that wasn't mentioned in any reviews thus far....

So far I'm satisfied. The holes on the mat line up with the clips on the floor of my 2007 Jeep Wrangler Sahara Unltd.  Just got these mats today and I like gow everything lines up. Not as heavy as I would like but can't complain for the price.

Great quality product.  Substantial copper wires.  The crimps are NOT the light weight junk ones you can get sometimes.  There is no question they are going to hold.  Overall some of the new wires are actually a thicker gauge than the old.One of my old connector pins cracked and I could no longer get speed 4 on my fan... and it was not the stat.  I cut the wires on this to about half length and pre-labeled them even though I moved one wire at a time to prevent confusion.  When done I wrapped it back up in electrical tape and put it into service.

I just installed this into the side of a pelican case. I used a 1-7/8" hole saw. It's a very tight fit and the pigtail makes installation a little challenging but pulling the cord slightly and putting my weight on the outlet got it to slide in slowly.Just before installing the plug, I noticed that it has a hole on the inside of the recess. My goal was to have a waterproof case to store my solar generator. The hole is about 1/8" and would allow water to get into the case. I will find a way to fill it in.

Did not fit my 2003 VTX 1800 R. Holes did not line up with the OEM backrest brackets however, was able to match the bottom hole and drill another tip hole in this rack. Was able to mount at that point by covering up the drilled hole with the sissy bar brackets. Clean install.

Installed on my Electra glide. Took 1-2 hours, (had to run to store and buy an Allen wrench.)Fit and finish is amazing. The performance that this gave my bike is amazing. It down shifts, takes off in 1st gear, all much much much more smooth. The engine has more power, the exhaust sounds better.This was the final performance part I bought for my bikes setup. I already had put Vance and Hines slip ons, and a Vance and Hines autotuner fuel pack on. This air intake was the biggest improvement though. All together it was a great purchase.This intake gives the most options. Leave it naked as in my pictures, buy one of the many covers offered, or get/make a custom cover.Well I hope this review is helpful. If it is please just hit the button that says this was helpful. It keeps me making my reviews better and better. Thank you and safe riding!

This cargo basket is of the upmost quality! I'd expect to pay at least double for it. It's very sturdy once assembled, as it ships in three pieces. Over each joint (8 total) there is a rubber sleeve to help keep the elements out. It recommends using lube for install, and I agree! I don't think it's possible without it. It pairs perfectly with the "XtremepowerUS 36" x 43" Nylon Cargo Net with 12 Neon Yellow Hooks" sold by xtremepowerUS. $10 for a cargo net? Sign me up!

I purchased the H1 5000K bulbs for my modified projector headlamps in a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee. They work great and are very bright, but the color is a tad warmer than the other 5000K bulbs they replaced (from a different vendor). Not sure if it's just a difference between manufacturers, but I was expecting a whiter light. Maybe i'm just splitting hairs, but these look closer to 4500K, which is more like an "OEM daylight" than a "bright white". But on the bright side (no pun intended), at least both bulbs match very well and the beam pattern from my headlights is excellent. In my picture you can see the 5000K bulb with a 6000K LED parking light under it.

This is a good seat for things like working on brakes. The bottom is a reinforced steel tray with 5 casters. It rolls pretty well on concrete.It's about 16" high at it's lowest height. A little higher than one I had a few years ago but it's not a bad height. Lift the ring and remove a little weight from the seat and it raises to a height of about 21". This is probably a good range to use this seat for things like waxing.The seat cover is a very glossy red plastic which makes wiping the seat clean pretty easy. I don't exactly appreciate the giant 'ATD' logo on the seat but that's probably just me.The center post is a gas filled hydraulic cylinder, just like other height adjustable chairs. The gas provides the pressure to push hydraulic fluid and raise the height of the seat. For the record, this is NOT pneumatic and it is correctly named 'hydraulic'.Assembly is simple. The cylinder pushes in to a taper in the lower tray, then just attach the seat to the upper metal piece with 4 screws and push that on the cylinder. It seems pretty well made.

This Genuine Toyota Accessories PT580-35050-LB Bed Mat  fits the 6 foot size beds of 2016 Toyota Tacoma perfectly.  I really like it and it keeps things from sliding around in the bed when driving the truck at least more so than without it.Very strong material and was easy to install.I actually have the 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off Road 4X4 with the Access Cab and six foot bed. This was a perfect fit in every way!

Over all a good product, the tape seems to worked very well. A few scratches were on it when I got it but nothing major. I used cardboard in the seams to make sure I had it where it was supposed to be. That made it alot easier to put on by myself. Fairly easy installation and the look? Judge for yourself, l like it. 4 stars for the scratches.

Perfect fit for the 7.3L IDI. Tested in a pan on the stove prior to installation(as we should always do with a thermostat) right next to the used one for comparison. At boiling(212*F) the old t-stat had only opened 1/4 of the distance this new one did! I'm very happy about this since I was often nearly overheating my engine but my cooling system was in otherwise great shape, with a new HD radiator and coolant filter even.I had a thermometer in the pan and this t-stat did begin to open right around 190*F. Perfect!

No U-boards to fasten to the frame of my trailer, no bolt to put into the wheel, no handle to turn, so my dirt-bike trip with friends is all but ruined. Thanks a lot.Dissatisfied Customer: Art Sr.

Very nice replacements to the original. It is extremely easy to put them on your car. Don't go to a mechanic or to a garage, they will ask you a lot of money for doing something very easy you can do at home. See my pictures for details. I strongly recommend these tail lens, the quality seems good and they are definitely cheaper than the original replacements.I had to change my original tail lamps because water was infiltrating causing damage to the bulb lights.My car is a Pontiac 2000 Grand Prix GT

As of July 2010, the pictures of this product are very misleading.  When a set of 10 levelers with a bag costs $41.00 (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Tri-Lynx-00015-10-Lynx-Leveler/dp/B0028PJ10K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tri Lynx 00015 (10)  Lynx Leveler</a>) you can't seriously think that you can get 4 sets of this product with bags and all for $16.00!  If it's too good to be true, it is.  Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this one out.  Yes, this is false advertising on Amazon's part, but don't blame Tri Lynx for this mistake.  These are great levelers made of hard plastic (not the cheaper yellow brand from EZ).  They can be used with the other products from Tri Lynx like the caps (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Tri-Lynx-00019-Lynx-Cap-Leveler/dp/B000UOBIZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tri Lynx 00019 Lynx Cap Leveler</a>) and the chalks (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Tri-Lynx-00018-2PK-Lynx-Stop-n-Chock-Leveler/dp/B000UODGIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tri Lynx 00018-2PK Lynx Stop'n Chock Leveler</a>).  For $16.00 you don't get a bag, just 4 orange levelers that can be used with the above mentioned caps under stabilizer jacks, or under the tongue jack (if you have a lighter trailer).  Of course, you could also use them under the tires as levelers, but you may want to get the 10 pack if you intend to use them for leveling.  Plus, you get a storage bag with the 10 pack.  Bottom line: great product, but don't believe the pictures.

Update:  I lowered my rating by one star.  Since you have to roll up this shade, it doesn't lay and look flat in the window.  Oh why didn't I return this overpriced piece of tinfoil.-------------- This product does everything the reviews say but I'm surprised hardly nobody mentions how inconvenient it is to put away.  It does not fold so you roll it up and then put the strap around it. But if you don't roll it tight enough then the strap don't fit so you have to reroll it.  Annoying.  Thinking about returning the shade but perhaps I'll call Heatshield and see if they have one that folds in one quick swoosh.

I purchased these LED's to replace the dome light in my truck.  I already had the map lights converted to LED's so the front was well illuminated but the back was the yellow incandescent.  The light popped right in without issue and works well.  It's a clean white color that is much better than the yellow.  My lights dim after starting the car and this light does that well.  I've had LED's in the past that flickered when dimming.  The build quality is really nice and overall I'm very happy with the results.  I received these LED's at a discount in exchange for testing and reviewing the product. I stand by my review and do not give discounted products great reviews if they do not deserve them. I count on honest reviews when making purchases as much as you do!

Great replacement over stock halogens. Was expecting something a bit brighter or maybe more of a bluer tint. The beam is white but if you look at the headlights in the housings it looks yellow. Already even got flashed a couple times. Will be replacing my high beams soon if I don't switch to HIDs.UPDATE: Totalled the car I originally bought these for, my first purchase after buying another car was more zXe's. It's been six months since install, with about half of my driving being at night, and the bulbs are still bright and crisp in my 2010 Dodge Charger. Will be buying high beam bulbs in the near future.

After reading some reviews on the bad spot welding and the pins not fitting.... but also seeing a lot of 'great' reviews, decided to buy it and hope I got a good set, as I was looking for a double lock feature... as I needed to just raise the front end of my SUV...Well.... after getting these, saw that the welding was about 50/50 on each jack stand, as in half good, half questionable. And, I have a 2-ton jack stand, and they seemed to be about the same gauge steel used on the frame.. hmmm..On one stand, the safety pin, barely goes under the jaw of the stand(see picture), it was straight, but only about 1-2mm under the jaw.. the other stand, was a different story. The pin was offset. as soon as you put the pin in, you could see how crooked it was, so it engaged under the jaw halfway in.I decided to give them a test under my trailblazer.. as soon as I lowered my vehicle onto it, I never heard stands make metal cracking noise... made me worry about even getting under the vehicle... I was changing out some front wheel bearing, so wasn't going under... I ended up putting my 2-ton stand next to these, my front tires I took off under the frame of the vehicle AND the hydraulic jack just pressed against the frame to make sure.. I had to get my axle bearing replaced and it was late, so no other stores were open...Anyways, these are going back... and I ended picking up a pair of 3-ton craftsman jack stands, on sale(cheaper) the next day! They were more heavy duty looking and the welding was all around good on it.. they didn't creek when I lowered the SUV onto it... it didn't have the 'safety' pin on it like I was looking for, but, I've been using jack stands without it anyways, just thought this was a good feature...if it was done right...

Received as a Christmas gift nearly two years ago.  Seemed to be well made and install was relatively easy but not without some challenges due to hardware and where I mounted it.  It mounts solid and no issues with it or the wiring in two years of being exposed to harsh Winters and road debris.  The first year or so it was fine.  I rarely used it, but it did provide some impressive additional light for spotting deer before they ran out into the road.  Hint:  Don't be the clueless jerk who uses this on the highway and leaves it on when other cars approach. It is very, very bright and throws a pretty useable beam, though not a very focused beam.About a year after install, I noticed about 3-4 of the LEDs no longer worked.  Then a couple of months later in the Spring, I noticed moisture had infiltrated the light housing and some areas of the light face had turned dark due to corrosion and probably a dozen or so LEDs went out.  Now, in the past couple of months, about half the lights are out and it is embarrassing to turn on.  So plan on maybe a year or so of use of it.  I had to ask the gift giver what light he ordered so I could order a replacement.  I was shocked that it was only $33.  I will replace it yearly or so since all the holes have been drilled and mounting/wiring has been done and it really does work well for the first year.

Good stuff! Worked as described. I used fiberglass mat + VLP glue to repair my riding lawnmower seat. Use sharp scissors on the fiberglass mat and be gentle w/ the cut pieces to minimize it's edges from separating/fraying.IMPORTANT: VLP sets up quickly, so preparing your surface and plan of action for application is important for best results.APPLICATION PROCESS I USED FOR REPAIRING VINYL SEAT1. Cleaned up tear edges using a razor blade since the final repair would be covered by fiberglass cloth2. Cut small circular section of vinyl at the ends of each tear to help mitigate the crack's progression. A paper hole punch may do the trick if you can get it under the vinyl. I used the tip of the utility razor blade to make approximately 1/8" diameter cuts. The key is to ensure it's a continuous cut to not allow another rip to start.3. Cut fiberglass mat to match tears leaving 1/2-1" margin on each side of tear4. Apply VLP to seat tear area using Popsicle stick including glue to cover the area covered by the mat5. Apply fiberglass mat to area quickly and work into the VLP glue w/ popsicle stick while adding a top coat of VLP. Be sure to cover the edges of the mat completely with VLP.6. Pull off any straggler pieces of fiberglass mat to ensure a smooth finish. Be mindful of the length of the fiberglass pieces you pull so as not to make the fraying worse. Adding more VLP may be a better option to get the fiberglass to lay down in some instances.6. Let dry for specified amount of timeBest of luck.

Only one part included, most people need 2.  Want to mar the experience just order one and take the bike apart to find it will take a few more days to get the other one. That will teach me to order on a phone and not read the quantity.Now I got that out of my system, It sounds Just right!I was not sure when ordering....but YES!  Just right!  I can hear myself think again.These have been installed on a 2007 Honda shadow 750c2 in short shots.They were a little harsh without and now they are great (Considering the length of the pipes) without they were a little raw and poppy.Now it cruses with a sweet sweet sound.

This was used in a project as a New Headlight for my 2016 DRZ400S. Check out my youtube channel for an install video: BrappinDRZI like to ride gravel and back roads at night. The problem was with the stock headlight I couldn't see s*#t. So I added the 4" square pod lights to the sides and those did decent but I wanted more. Then I saw this light and was like "H%ll Yes this is what I need".Pros:-Has both Floods and Spots. Which can act as Lows and Highs.-H#lla bright!-It is LED = More light output less power draw-Build Quality seems good-Has separate wires for the floods and spots. So they can be turned on or off independently.Cons:-Not DOT approved....-There is a noticable gap between the "plastic" cover for the LEDs and the metal framing. (I siliconed this so no water could sit in it.)-Didn't come with "side" mounts but if you pull off the side cover there is a perfect place to drill a hole. Because it has the place to put a bolt.(Explain this in my video)Overall I love this light. I did have to modify the light to make it work but I expecting that because it isn't a plug and play light. The finished product to me looks pretty good and it is very bright. Which I like because not everyone looks out for motorcycles so this will help with that and also help me see deer before they see me.

Came in as advertised, seemed to be a good value, worked great for about 10 months.  Then it began to flicker in sections, then those sections stopped working altogether. See the attached pic. I contacted the seller and was told it was out of warranty.  That's it, nothing else. I'm stuck with a product that stopped working after a relatively short period of time. So, considering it's made to go onto an automobile and it didn't last even a reasonable time what would/could you do with it?  Disappointing.

2013 Lexus ES 350:  I have had these installed now for about 2 months and so far i am pleased with them.  The bulbs are not flickering nor am i receiving odometer feedback issues like others have stated. However, i did run into some minor issues installing the bulbs, but i will not blame it on the seller because initially i knew that my OEM bulb number did not match-up with LED bulb. I simply took the advice off another review, with a similar vehicle, and, therefore,  i assumed that they would automatically fit.Here are some of the issues i encountered:  First, the bulb's pinout did not match-up perfectly-- it was slightly longer in length. After snipping-off a little of the metal, and shaping it to the OEM, i had a perfect fit.  Finally, after snipping off the metal from the LED bulb, i had an issue getting the bulb to fit into the fog light housing because the LED's rubber gasket was too thick. To resolve this issue, i used the rubber gasket's from my OEM bulbs.  Other then the minor setbacks the bulbs seem to be working flawlessly. I would definitely use them again, even with having to slightly mod them.  I have enclosed some pics so that others can see exactly what i encountered.

i have had this for 2+ years and it has not failed me yet and provides that light that I need while staying stiff and rigid even when going through rough terrain.  It's worth mentioning that the clear face of it is still clear and has not yellowed like others I have had in the past!  Would recommend, just wish there were some options with regard to the types of mounts that came with it.

I was torn between these and another product at a significantly higher price. If I was on the fence again and could afford the higher dollar ones I would buy them. Here's why; These are okay but the way they are put together and the design for mounting leaves something to be desired. Each fender is constructed of multiple pieces. There is the one-piece fender portion and then multiple pieces for the bracketry. The bracket pieces are attached to the fenders by what I would call a plastic welding process in multiple places. That by itself is not really a negative but that coupled with the way the actually attach to the Jeep makes me wonder how long those points will hold up. When you mount the brackets to the Jeep the fenders contact the side of the jeep with the brackets still sitting an eighth inch or better from the side of the Jeep. When the brackets are tightened to flush up to the side of the Jeep, it puts a lot of stress on the weld points. On one of mine you can actually see three dimples in the top of the fender because of this. There is a gap between each of the brackets as well which will allow sand, dirt, mud, and whatever else to get between the bracket and your Jeeps paint. This may not be an issue if you have these installed forever, but could be an issue if you decide to go another way in the future. Also the included hardware is not stainless and will rust very quickly. I used the original hardware except on the very front. I am adding photos to illustrate the things I have stated in this review. I may have been able to trim the inside (towards Jeep body) edge of the fenders (not the brackets) to decrease the offset between the pieces but I did not want to risk damaging one beyond repair and that sort of thing should not be necessary anyway. If you are on a really tight budget and really want a flat fender that looks thick (the outside edge is just curved under) Then you may want to go with this product. Another option is to buy the stock style 7" flares and trim the outside edge off them to your liking, or just buy the high dollar ones instead.

These were super easy to install, and they work great. The kit includes two mirrors, and a nice carrying case. The only out-of-the-box assembly required is to install one screw through the arm and into the  ball joint on the back of the mirror. Five minutes, tops. The clamps fit into the narrowest of gaps on factory mirrors (the photo shows one installed on my 2006 Jeep Liberty), and are very adjustable. They stayed in place over fairly rough roads, at speeds up to 70mph. They're very lightweight, so I wouldn't leave them installed full time, but they're perfect for occasional use.

Incorrect picture of the product.  I received one that looks like the 90106-C1 (do a search for it). Return costs are about the cost of the product so I'm stuck with it.  One answer in the Customer Questions and Answers section said theirs has the crank hole 2 3/4 inches from the small screw hole along the edge and another said theirs was 3 1/2 inches so the product being shipped must not be consistent. Notice in the picture of the one I received has no hole for the switch and the crank hole is further from the edge than the picture of the item shown.

So, thanks to Tommy of Richmond for the tip on making this install MUCH easier and practically tool-less.  Instead of a star driver and all that jazz, all you actually need are a small flathead screwdriver and MAYBE a pair of pliers.Pics are attached, but basically:1. Pop the backing off the socket attached to the ball on the glass using a flathead screwdriver, then pop that off the ball.  Unscrew it from the shaft, and set it and the socket aside.2. Unscrew the entire old strut from the bottom ball/socket leaving them attached to the car.3. Take the new strut, and unscrew both sockets from it, leaving just threaded ends.4. Screw the new strut into the bottom socket.5.  Screw the original top socket onto the shaft of the new strut.6. Pop it back onto the ball attached to the window glass, and reinsert the backing plate.7. Repeat steps 1-6 for other side, then throw out the sockets and balls that came with the new struts (or better yet, use them for another project so as not to be wasteful.)I did this in my driveway in the rain in about 8 minutes.  Easiest thing ever, and now the glass works great again!  Stays open when opened, and closes itself smoothly.

What a serious disappointment, it fell apart after 6 months.  I paid $40+ last August and now, after one mild Florida winter, it's March and the car cover is literally falling apart.  I really feel like I got ripped off with this purchase.This is truly very poor quality control.  This is not a case of a few seams coming apart, the material itself is actually disintegrating.  The slightest pull anywhere on the cover and the material will separate.  I first noticed the problem where on the side mirrors.  The cover was separating where it bends over the edge of the mirrors.  The problem is obviously with the material itself.Budge promises a 5 year warranty but then says that I have to mail back the cover and wait up to 45 days for a replacement.  The question is, do I want to invest the time and expense and leave my car uncovered for 6 weeks only to have the next one fall apart in 6 months?....

I bought this for my 2017 JKU Rubicon and they fit perfectly but on one part of the lateral ones, it is unsticking slightly.  They are firmly in place overall and have survived the hot Texas summer.  They compliment my Wrangler well and add a distinctive look (see photos).

It looks just like shiny black tape till the lights hits. Nearly invisible on my helmet.(if I did it again I would just surround the existing shapes rather than making some new lines so it would look unaltered during the day). All in all 50 feet give a lot of room for redo it.

great shape for motorcycles,small compact & greatly increases your conspicuity (visibility). I have learned to point them out & up just a little.check them in daylight, from a good distance, standing in front of them & walking off to both sides. I don't want to blind people,but don't want them saying they couldn't see me. better them irritated, than me crashed!! put some on the G/F's bike & @ a longer distance & @ almost any angle, you see these before you see the stock headlight.low cost,lots of light.people SHOULD see you now. If you mount these on a longer (4"+) bracket,make sure it's strong. I mounted 2 on my forks on some fairly thick stuff & the brackets broke where I bent them  90* @ the fork. I should've welded them @ the bend to reinforce it.WARNING-- remove one screw @ a time & use threadlock fluid (loctite 242)or similar)on EVERY screw(large & small) or they can shake apart. Cars may be better about this but in time....I've learned this on most car/bike mounted chinese items,more than once.even when tight,they can loosen. it's worth a couple bucks to save you the grief.

This product arrived at the house without any damages. No leaks to the product of any kind. Everything was boxed up and brand new.A guy at work told me about this stuff. It works really well. He was telling me they had a hole in an oil pan from a bolt getting tightened down too much. They were able to fix the hole in the oil pan with the Q Bond. It held until the new pan arrived, which was around a week or so. After hearing that I knew I needed some. I'm constantly having stuff break and can barely fix it with Gorilla Glue or superglue.I had a belt buckle that was shipped to me and broken in transit. I got a refund on it so it was free. I figured I might as well try to fix it. The stud that goes in the belt hole was broken off. I used gray powder Q Bond to put the stud back on the belt buckle. As seen in the picture it is holding fine. That is a pretty big deal since that stud has a lot of force on it once placed in the belt hole.I had a piece of plastic break off my cup holder lid in the car. The lif would no longer stay closed since the piece of plastic was what locked it into place. I used this product to place the plastic piece back on. It held just fine and the lid now operates as it should. No other glue would give such a clean fix.Don't glue your fingers together! The liquid glue sets up quickly. I almost lost a finger to the buckle. Really though, I did have to pull it off pretty quick. It is faster setting than super glue. I will use more caution next time and shouldn't have any problems.I like the little box that everything comes in. I'm keeping it in there to keep it organized. Everything comes with two little thumbtacks to scuff up the surface before you work on it. A scuffed surface holds the powder better and allows you to get the liquid to it. With proper powder placement you will have a clean fix. Like I said before, like no other glue that I've tried provides this.The cowl on my F-150 has been messed up since the day I got it. The two pieces always wanted to separate and the driver side rise up. I could snap it back together but it wouldn't hold very long. I got tired of fooling with it. I put Q Bond down in between those two cowl pieces and now it is held together. I haven't had it come back apart since I did this.I've already recommended this to a lot of people. Especially when I see that someone is trying to fix something or has something broke. I will be keeping this stuff on hand from now on. I'm just surprised I hadn't heard of it until recently, especially since it works so well.

This went on a 2015 F150, with a plastic bedliner. The instructions are very simple.. however they have a side note saying, vehicles with plastic bed liners must cut out the area where this is to go, this item does not mount over the plastic....... WHAT????The latching bracket is the only place I cut out the bedliner.. a 3x6" area JUST for just the lower portion of the latching bracket to lay 'true'. I then mounted everything up. I then drilled holes through the bedliner (in line with the factory box holes) and mounted the swing plate and bolted it up.Moment of truth:... I installed the box on the swing plate.. fit perfect.. then went to close it, the bed liner is just a bit thick, but with a firm close against the latching bracket, it locks in place. With the bedliner "slightly pressuring" the swing box, it is a little stiff when pulling on the release lever, however it unlatches and latches just fine with slight pressure, Im hoping the bedliner will set in and conform after time. Mind you it is winter in WI and things are stiffer at this time.Otherwise it looks great, and sure beats the milk crate I had tie strapped to the back of the box!

ASIDE FROM IT LOOKING SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT ON THE TOP END I WENT AHEAD AND INSTALLED IT. IDLE ISSUE WORSEN. ACCELERATED AND CAR DIDNT MOVE. IM MECHANICLLY EXPERIENCED NOT ONLY WITH IACs BUT OVERALL VEHICLE MAINTENANCE INSTALLS AND REPAIR. SO I REINSTALLED JUST IN CASE AND SAME WORSEN ISSUE. THIS IS NOT A COMPATIBLE IAC FOR A 2003 MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE 2.4. AND MAKING MORE OF A HEADACHE SELLER WONT REFUND UNTIL THE PART ARRIVES TO HIM AS IF I WANT TO KEEP THE THING. BUY SOMEWHERE ELSE.

This was a really nice product to cap off my inverter project.  It provides a complex function at a really low price.  It is plastic and you have to wire the connections yourself with your own wires (makes sense though since each application would be unique).  Instructions are good and make sense.  I probably triple checked my work three times (yeah that's nine times total) before powering it up.  There's no easy way to secure the shunt (the black plate on negative side) directly so I just secured the cables and that works fine.  See picture. It took some soldering and figuring to install so probably only for handy DIYers

Nice and bright. Only problem is that so far every manufacturer that makes these doesn't add moisture seals to their lights. This one same as a previous one I had, developed a similar issue. It's only a matter of time before it fails so if it wasn't because of this, I would've given it five stars. By the way, I've only had these for two weeks.

JK owners - Don't be cheap.  Buy this mount if you are planning on running a 50" LED light bar.  I know this one costs a bit more than a Rugged Ridge or a Made in China brand - but seriously - You won't regret it.  I bought the cheap Chinese imitation - what a piece of junk.  Has a huge gap at the top of the windshield - looked awful.  This Rigid version was designed to eliminate that gap and provide a much more sturdy mounting solution.  It comes powder coated black.  If you want to put up a pair of Dually spotlights, you will need an additional mount for them.  I recommend the Poison Spyder mounts.  They work perfect together.

This will not come with the ball...I read through the description and still thought the ball would be included. Anyway, it is well made, heavy duty, and versatile. It can also connect to my garden trailer which has a pin mount and pull something with a cable and hook if I like. The ball bolt leaves very little room if you wanted to place a hook onto the lower ring...design flaw on their part. The bolt that connects this to whatever you have is 3/4 inch diameter...that's a big hole needed to accommodate this guy. I got lucky, after seeing the bolt I thought I would need to drill out a larger hole but, all was good. I can see this being an issue for some tractors. Another issue may be this ball hitch will be too low to pull the rented log splitter around my property and that's the only reason I bought this thing. If you want to spend more money, they do make these extended higher for low tractors like mine. I'll give an update.  UPDATE: as said above the install was easy... but,  It does not stay put as others said even with the locking washer provided. Also, due to the design it puts a lot of downward pressure on my tractor where this thing mounts onto. The end result has been a bent plate where this mounts to, fixable but this is worthless and I can't use it. Even pulling a log splitter was a pain. If you would like I have pics to post on here, just ask :)

My husband is a roofer and they often work well into winter.  His face gets chafed so I knew this would perfect for him to try out.  The mask is very soft and somewhat stretchy.  It is quite long and bunches around his neck when he puts it on.  The mask pulls above his nose and stayed securely in place.  It was easy to put on and he reported it was not rough at all and was very comfortable.Best of all, you get two.  So while one is in the wash, you have another to wear.  I washed the mask on gentle cycle and allowed it to air dry.  There were no laundering instructions so I thought that would be the safest way.  It worked just fine.  In addition for outdoor working, it would be ideal for motorcycle riding to keep dirt and dust out or to keep you warm when it's cold.  It could also be used as part of a Halloween costume.  Overall, my husband really likes these masks and I know they will get a lot of use!*I received this product at a discounted price to test for quality and provide a truthful and unbiased review.

If you have a Forrest River Flagstaff MAC 206LTD I'll let you know that these DO fit your furnace vents. I just installed these this past weekend and have no real complaints.A tip is make sure the center bracket is centered as much as possible. If it's slightly off it'll try and pull the cover in that direction making it off center and/or try and pull it onto the screws and start to lift it up.My only concern is how log these will last. They're held on with a spring with only a little piece of metal that's been bent at an angle pulling tension.  I have this fear that the spring is going to snap and rocket itself inside the furnace.

Not recommended for novices ,May require wire splicing in many cases. If you do not know how to splice wires, I do not recommend this kit because the ground in this relay kit is only 3 inches from the ballast, so if you have to place the ballast near a ground able bolt or you can do what I did for freedom of ballast placement cut and splice both ground wires to a single line and connect it to the ground post.Product has a nice build quality for the price. light works greatThis Relay kit is good for smaller cars, there's not alot of line to work with, so keep that in mindAlso I replaced the 25A fuse with a 20A one, the 25A fuse supplied would probably work ok but I have had cheap fuses melt the plastic and not burn through.Below is a list of supplies I used for my installSocket wrench for battery terminals (mine was 10mm)6 feet of copper wire with hose cover (similar to the one that comes with the relay on the hot wire)2 butt splicers and a terminal connector to attach to the battery(-), and wire crimper to strip and connect wiresZip Ties, to support and secure wiringScissors to cut Zip tieswill post a diagram with UNDERLINED words are not included in the kit

Fits perfect on my 2014 Ford F150. Looks great. Money well spent.I also ordered the stainless steel tailgate package. Really adds to a plain tailgate. Fits and looks very nice.Take your time and double check before you remove the paper on the tape then press on. 3M tape, (glue) on the backing.Top quality product. I also included a few pictures.

This item fits perfectly in my 2016 Hyundai Tucson and it looks like it came from the factory. It is well made and I love that the rubber inserts can be taken out for cleaning.I do not know what the small hole is for on the shallow end, but it is shaped like if it was to put in a switch of some kind.IMHO, Hyundai should have included this with the vehicle, but since they didn't, I am glad Vesul made one.Overall, it serves its purpose and I highly recommend it.

Penray is by far the best undercoating I've tried.  I originally used 3m and didn't like the texture, so i switched to this stuff.  I top coated over POR 15 and the coverage is nice and even with a matte black finsh. Like any paint project, prep is the most important step.  If you take the time to do it right, this stuff will produce  an exceptional finish.

I bought a used Mustang with some wear and scratch marks on the black textured driver's door trim.  The usual Armor-All and other trim products did not work well and any effect faded after a short few hours.  Wipe New, after an hour, seems to have done the trick.I've been researching vinyl dyes, vinyl paint, etc and watched several YouTube videos, including those for Wipe New.  As here, the Wipe New reviews are polarized - great or crap!I saw Wipe New in Walmart and thought what the heck; if it doesn't work, it's just $20 down the drain. I haven't found anything else to-date.  It looked like it would do what I needed - restore the shine and even out the dull wear pattern.  As stated elsewhere, watch the video's from Wipe New on YouTube to understand the application process and read/follow the written instructions in the kit. It's not difficult.I had experimented with a black permanent marker pen to darken the scratches and I had proved that Isopropyl alcohol (Walgreens or CVS) would help fade the intense dark black to similar to the trim and remove it completely if necessary with prolonged wiping.  I also proved that the ink was resistant to a light wipe from acetone, which I assume is one of the solvents in Wipe New.In the garage, I lightly wiped down the trim with isopropyl alcohol to remove any residues.  After touching up the scratches with marker pen and wiping back to blend it in as best as I could (not perfect but better than leaving it untouched), I applied the Wipe New, just like on the YouTube video's.  I used the isopropyl to remove any over-wipe onto the trim I didn't want Wipe New'd.  I then waited 5-7 mins and reapplied a second coat, per the videos.  The gloss is now nicely restored.  I can still see the scratches if I get a flashlight and angle it just right, (Wipe New is like a clear coat and transparent) but the result is way better than before Wipe New (wish I had bothered with before and after photos).  Time will tell how durable this product is, but my guess is several months on an interior.  At which point, I'll just reapply a coat.  Hopefully, there are no adverse surface finish issues over time that makes the trim look worse than it was without the product.After an hour, I tried rubbing the trim in an inconspicuous area to see how "hard" it had set.  Only if I rubbed really hard did the shine dull.  Giving the whole trim a light wipe with a microfiber towel had no effect.  It should be fully cured after 24 hours.  It looks like I need to Wipe New the other door trim to ensure they have the same sheen (its condition is far better and like new), but I'll wait a while to see if the finish holds up on the one side first and gauge how much it dulls/wears over time.UPDATE #1:48 hours later:  The gloss level has decreased slightly compared with the 1 hour sheen.  The scratches on the trim are more noticeable than when the Wipe New was first applied, but still much better than before applying the Wipe New.  The dull areas on the trim though are still covered, which was my primary goal.  I will report back again as time progress and I notice more changes in the finish.I'll be reporting back!

Less than 10K on these wires. Rubber inside melted and disfigured. Connectors corroded. Misfire on cylinder 3 because of wire failure....connector stayed with plug when wire was removed.I DO NOT RECCOMMEND. To bad too because I run NGK plugs in all my cars and bikes.ETA: Had to take coil pack off the car to get the end of the wire out for #3. While doing so, another wire snapped off in the coil pack. The second wire end was melted into the coil pack. Took me an hour to get it out.Put on some used Bosch wires I got for free and the car runs perfect. Spend the extra money and get the OEM Bosch wires.

I recently purchased a Goldwing GL1500 and had to remove the ridiculous Markland floorboards and replaced them with these ISO Wing Pegs.  Although Amazon lists them as incompatible for the GL1500, they mounted easily with the correct Kuryakyn adapter.  These are very comfortable and, in my opinion, the best option when a good set of floorboards is not available for your bike.They are solid, heavy pegs and do not rotate despite the tapered adapter. The rubber does not fill the gaps around the metal completely, but this does not seem to affect the performance.

Nice packaging, installed them on my 2003 Tahoe Z71.Was easy to install once I found out the little trick. The adjustment screw you need to grab the thread with pliers an turn so the lower plastic tabs rotate 1/4 turn.  Pull framing just enough to install new led light. Took about 10 min each side to install. Nice clean look. Bright 6000k look.

This thing does exactly as advertised. I went from factory 30 inch tires to 35 12.50After installing the 35's the wrangler was sluggish on acceleration and the shift points were off along with the correct MPH. The flash Cal 5 eliminated all that and then some. Down loading the app per the instructions was seamless. In a very short time I had it connected to the wranglers com port and explorered the different options available. I'm so happy with this purchase it really was seamless. Thanks superchips ! I recommend this to anyone doing mods.

Perfect fit, excellent coverage.  Second vehicle we have placed these on.  Always worth the money!  Package arrived looking like hammered crud, but they are floor mats - not much to damage.  Same thing happened 4 years ago with our previous set we ordered...  but the mats fit great, and work well.  In our last vehicle We used them for several years of wet Pacific Northwest winters, including mud and snow and slush and crud.  The carpets underneath were as good as new: No moisture, no mold, no stains, no debris.

Used this to take the crank bolt off a k24 in a CRV. Before buying this I tried a regular impact socket,  jumping on a breaker bar/Jack stand, and an Ingersoll Rand flyweight style socket. Tried all of those both cold and after heating the bolt with map 2. This Lisle socket took it off cold in 3 seconds. It took longer to open the package, no joke. Worth every penny.

Had a extra set of mtd 5-bolt, 12x7 rims and mounted these 25X10.00-12 bear claws on them. Took my 26x12-12 turf tires off my 1998 simplicity legacy and put these on for snow duty. These being skinny with a lot of traction work great. The diameter is about the same, but these tires are 2" narrower than my turfs. In snow, they work as good as my turfs with chains on. Very happy with these atv tires. I have a set of chains for them, but have not had a need for them yet here in MN. I figure if we ever get a lot of ice, then I may need chains. But have not had a issue yet with ice.They ride smooth and very stable, no sidewall flexing even with added rear weight to the tractor. The offset of the rims I used, keeps the tire with distance the same as the original tires. With turfs they stick out 2" past the fender. With the bear claws 2-1/4" past the fenders. I would not be afraid to mow a steep ditch with these on.Update- Still blowing snow and no chains. Because of a wet season, been mowing with the bearclaws on. Some pretty muddy soft areas, never stuck yet. No signs of wear on the tires, pretty good considering mowing more than 6 acres with a 60" deck.

Installed today on my 2015 Subaru XV Crosstrek. Put these on in the cool Michigan fall with no issue. Used a high-power hair dryer for about two minutes per piece. Immediately applied each, using my fingers to smooth and contour them till cooled. As of right now, I'm extremely happy with the quality, fit and look. I will update the review in the future if I have any issues with wind or car washes, but for now I am very optimistic given the fit when I put them on.

It is smaller than I expected. This adds to the bobber look. I like that. I have done a couple hundred miles with it, two fill ups. No leaks, It looks good. It is not as easy to take off as the OE cap, but once you realize that, it isn't hard, even with gloves on. I might scuff and paint it to remove the gloss, but for now, it is fine.

UPDATE: added a night picture. It is only at the house, I will be going to the lease in a couple of weeks and will get some better pictures. It does not do it justice. It lit up the whole front of the house like it was daytime.Finally got the big one installed. I ended up putting it on the hood. It looks pretty good to me. We will see how it holds up in the long run and next time I am at the lease.Construction looks pretty good. The all aluminum housing makes it fairly light. The paint has good coverage and I did not see any nicks or dings in it. The wire leads are 12 gauge wire.I did hook it up to my bench top power supply and took some reading:22A @ 12v19.5A @ 13v17.7A @ 14vSo it runs about 250ish watts give or take.Now the one thing I do not really like about it are the mounts. They are kind of small for the size of light. There is only one bolt holding it so it tends to shake a bit, maybe it should come with some wider base mounts to have at least two bolts to help stabilize it.I just had time to get it mounted. I have not wired it to a switch yet. I hard wired it to the battery to take some pictures. I will get some updated night time pictures later.

Nice little product to remedy one of the silly things that should have been included from the factory. These were always getting gummed up with mud and the last time I was working under the vehicle there was a small wasp nest inside which I wasn't happy about. These sealed the hole up perfectly. Little tip for installing, use a little soapy water around the outside of the lip and press it in using a circular motion so you don't bend the sides and ruin the seal.

My 2009 Nissan Altima 2.5 was missing at low idle and under acceleration.  With a 120,000 miles I figured it was due for spark plugs ($75 for stock platinum)  but with no real impact.  If anything it got worse in the next few days.  I ordered the ENA pack, very quick change out with a single bolt for each under the plastic motor cover.  Now running smooth as can be.8/5/16  - unfortunately they only lasted for about a week.  It appears as if they are re-manufactured with a semi clear plastic poured over the replaced coils.  I got about three hundred miles on them when the engine starting running much worse than before.  Autozone ran the code and told me pistons one and two were missing.  as soon as i pulled the plastic engine cover I could visually see cracks in the first two coils and some of the first coil was backing out of the clear coat.  I paid Autozone for new ones and made it another two hundred miles before the third coil started cracking.  I suspect a small rain storm may have had something to do with when they failed but considering they are covered and some moisture should be anticipated I can't recommen.  I feel like I wasted my $55.  do not buy.

Been installed on jeep for the last few weeks, great light for the price, you can't beat it.. no moisture or leak issues.. no flickering or dead leds.. The light is crisp and bright as hell.. I have mine pointed a little lower as I use it for a flood light to see the trail directly in front of my jeep.. I am very happy with buying this light bar and have no regrets. I would buy it again in a heart beat

I was sceptical at first, but now that I've been using it for about a week or so, I Really like this Helmet! I love the pop-down sun visor, and the face shield makes my ride so much more warm and Quiet! Being able to pop up the whole front of the helmet is super convenient for me when I need to tinker with something really quick. It's a great feature. I've been wearing Sho__'s for years and I enjoy this Helmets fit and Especially the incredible 180+ of pure vision and not having to wear goggles!  10 Stars!

They replaced my ugly, torn up stock lug lugs but they also come with a "special" key lock for a nut on each wheel. This key I doubt will keep people from actually stealing them but as many people claim this will only slow them down because they will need to hammer a small enough bolt around this "special" lug. If you are really looking to protect your wheels make sure you buy at LEAST 2 different sets of locks for you wheels.

"BMW Approved vs Exceed BMW Specifications"Two words in particular are often listed on oil packaging-"approved" and "exceeds"-and it's critical you differentiate between the two. While both sound good, the former is more important, since it indicates your oil has been approved for use in your vehicle by the vehicle manufacturer and will keep your warranty intact. For example, Pennzoil Ultra Euro 5W-30 carries a BMW LL-04 approval rating. This means Pennzoil sent its oil to BMW, and BMW rigorously tested it to ensure that it meets requirements for stability, drain intervals, longevity, wear, emissions, and so on."Exceeds," on the other hand, is simply an oil manufacturer's claim and doesn't necessarily indicate any real basis of comparison as to what it exceeds. When an oil brand claims it "exceeds manufacturers specifications," that's simply the oil manufacturer's opinion and not necessarily the vehicle manufacturer's. Think about it-would you really think if the product was sent to BMW to be tested that BMW would sent a letter back stating, "We're sorry, but this oil is just too good and exceeds all of our specifications so we can't give you approval"?According to BMW documents, they suggest that LL-04 oil should only be used in Europe due to th low sulfur content of diesel and petro. US fuel (even top tier gasoline) has too much sulfur.  For all modern BMW engine (minus the ///m motorsport engines) u must use ll-01 approved oil like  Pennzoil 5w40.Here are some of the specs for this oil from Pennzoil/shell documents:Approval:-MB 229.51-VW 504 00 and VW 507 00-BMW LL-04-Porsche C30HT/HS is an amazing 3.68 (other BMW LL-01 oil on has 3.5)Gravity, API: 34Specific Gravity @15.6 (c): 0.85Viscosity @40 (c), cst: 67.1Viscosity @100 (c), cst: 12Flash Point (f): 420Pour Point (c): -39CCS Viscosity, cP (c): 6600Boack Volatility: 11

Not only did this product show up with folds creating creases which transferred into the application even after warming and working with a heat gun. This stuff bubbles like crazy, I also noticed that there is a protective layer that you have to remove and I'm not talking about the backing.

I installed these on my 2015 Sierra STE 4x4 Crew Cab Z71.  It took about 45 min to install and they look really good!  I had no problem with fit at all!  I know Amazon says this does not fit my truck, but others have installed them on the same truck and there is no problem fitting.The mounting brackets are really nice heavy duty.  Plenty of hardware is supplied, and I was able to use all but 4 factory weld nuts in the chassis.  Other 4 locations were C-clip nuts and they worked perfectly.  To make the install more secure I used thread lock.I would definitely recommend this to others!

So far so good. The led's work well. Only problem with this kit is the extension cables are too short. The cables didn't reach from the grille to the bottom of the dash. I had to splice extra cable. I think the cables should be at least 4-5ft longer. It's better for them to be too long as opposed to too short.

Update:I have had, and used mine for about 6 months now, and so far, it still works great. I have not had any problems with it so far. But, to be honest, it is a tire gauge.. Something like this, unless you work using it in a garage all day, it only gets used once in a while. For that reason, I have only used mine many a couple dozen times.Original Review:I have only done limited testing on this one so far, but so far, it is pretty good. I have another one just like this, but from a different brand. The only difference I can see between the two of them is, the colors are switched, the black is where the grey is and vise versa, and the brand name on them is different. Other then that, identical. The other one that I have, I have been using for something like 6 months, and it has held up pretty good so far, so I do not see why this one would be any different, since they are pretty much the same thing.I am not just going by that though. I did take this one out and checked the pressure on this one, vs some other ones that I know are accurate, and they all were the same, or almost the same pressure. All of them were within 0.5 pounds of each other.. So I would say that this one is pretty accurate from what I can tell. I only tested stuff up to about 40 psi though, so I can not comment on anything above that.. I do know that my other one is accurate up to something like 90psi, so I have confidence that this one will be too.As the description states, it does PSI, BAR, KPA, and Kg/CM2 readings. I obviously have only tested the psi reading, so I will not comment on any of the other readings. This also has an LED light in the tip, to make it easy to see the valve stem when checking the pressure at night. This makes things much easier. The seal around the nozzle, where you put it to check the pressure, I found seals very easily and well when checking the pressure. I have had some that I have had problems getting it to seal around the valve stem, and ended up loosing a bit of air trying to check the pressure. This one was very pleasant to use. The grip is also pretty comfortable. It is not the most comfortable thing that I have ever used, but it is decent enough that I have no problems with the feel.If you ever have problems with something not working, inside of this is 2 sets of batteries. There is a CR2032 battery, and 3 LR44 batteries. the CR2032 battery is what is used for doing the actual reading. It works the main part of the device. the LR44 batteries are used only for running the LED lights on it. So, if one or the other stops working, you just need to get some new batteries. Obviously these batteries set up like this are not bad since they should last a long time under normal use, but to be fair, I think that a door on it, and being able to change the batteries without having to take it apart would be nicer.. Kind of like how you change the batteries in a remote control for your TV.To take it apart, there is just 2 #1 phillips screws that you need to take out, and it just comes apart. If you do take it apart, watch the power button not to loose it. It is just a loose piece of black plastic, that will fall out once you take the 2 sides apart.Will I say that this is the best pressure gauge around. No way.. It is cheap.. It is made out of almost all plastic too. But I would not expect an industrial tire gauge at around $10 either. If this was a $30 or more gauge, then there is no way that I would be giving it 5 stars, but it is not. I think that under general use, this will hold up just fine for a long time.As for build quality. It is decent. the plastic is not great, but not cheap plastic. It will hold up to a little bit of abuse, like dropping it on the ground, and stuff like that, but I would say that it would probably flatten like a pancake / hotcake if you ran it over with a car. It is just a basic setup, and it works fine for just that. and that is all it claims to be.Overall, I think that it is decent for the price. As I stated, it does have its downfalls, like you having to take it apart to replace the batteries, but at least you can change the batteries. All things that I can find are minor things, that are just more of a minor annoyance, then anything. But, I still find it pretty decent for the price.

This mount is about half the cost of the stock/OEM mount from Mazda.  The rubber bushing of the stock mount leaves a couple of air gaps, however this unit does not.  Rubber is filled throughout the bushing which supports the weight better but at the cost of more vibrations.Two things:The picture Amazon shows is incorrect.  The mount does not come with nuts.  If you want to see what the mount bushing looks like, Google Beck Arnley 104-1606 and look at the images.  Also, in Amazon's database it states that it does not fit my '03 Protege5.  I can tell you that it does fit and works.  I had tried the DEA A6486 (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/B0067UCKBE/dp/B0067UCKBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">B0067UCKBE</a>&nbsp;on Amazon, however, the build quality was not good...in particular the threads being soft and prone to stripping.  And the bushing was not rubber so it caused more vibrations at idle.  You can read my review for the DEA mount for more info.*UPDATE (after a month and a half of it being installed)- I purchased a new stock OEM mount and there is noticeably less vibrations/shaking while idling.

I purchased 2 sets of these for a total of 4 lights on my ARB bumper on my 1988 Isuzu Trooper. Installation was simple and straight forward. They have been installed for about a month or so and 1 out of the 4 lights has developed moisture/water behind the lens. That's a 25% failure rate for the IP67 rating so keep that in mind. I'm having a difficult time finding information for a warranty exchange.

Works great and looks great for application.I had to put a resistor from NC contact to the positive led and a diode between the NO contact and positive led pin to create a dimmer effect for half bright when off and full bright when on. Works like a charm day or night.

Just slightly dimmer than a standard 1157 bulb when compared side-by-side. They claim 800 lumens, but its more like 400 considering a standard 1157 is 440. In the picture, this product is installed on the left, and a standard 1157 bulb is installed on the right; the brake light is on, i.e. the bulbs are in bright mode. They do however have significant advantages over the standard bulbs. They draw much much less current, they don't get even a little bit warm, and they transition between dim and bright instantly which is good for flasher circuits.

I have a 2004 330ci coupe and had a Service Engine Soon and Airbag Light on.  I received this scanner and literally bypassed the instructions, plugged it in, ran diags and found my problems within minutes.  I reseated a cable for the sevice code and recognized the Airbag code was due to previous repairs and did not reset.  I was able to delete all codes, restarted the car and the annoying dash lights were gone.  I asked the shop to run the codes for me when they changed my oil and they said it would be a couple hundred bucks just to hook the car up for diagnostics.  I immediately ordered this tool and I am happy to report that it saved me time, money and gave me a piece of mind knowing exactly what was wrong with my car.  Very easy to use.

This is not 120 watt.  Bench testing shows draw to be just under 3.5 amps on a 12 volt system.What is wrong with this light bar?  It is antiquated.  Old tech.  Generic LED chips facing forward, with a reflector cup, was state of the art about 10 years ago.  Today's chips are designed and built better, and are offered with refractors engineered to optimize LED wavelength display.  Each LED is suppose to be the equivalent of a 3 watt halogen.  There are 20 LED.  This is not how you configure lighting.  Side marker lights on cars are t10, or  10 watt halogen.  Interior dashboard lights are typically T5, or 5 watt halogen  Lining up 40 dim lights does not give you 1 bright light.  That is why headlights use a 55 watt halogen, instead of 11 5 watt halogens lined up next to each other.This light bar's technology goes back to when LED was bright to look at, but actually put less light on the road than the halogen it was meant to replace.  Each LED is very bright to look at, but projects very little useable light.  So the manufacturer simply lines up 40 low output lights in hopes that all the numbers will add up.  And you will be impressed because your eyes hurt when you look into them.  What you will get is a very bright light in the immediate area in front of your car, but no light at all further down the road.  Great if you only need to see 20 feet ahead.  But useless if you need to see 100 feet ahead.  Imagine that you can see for about 2 car lengths, but not all the way down the block.On your USA vehicle, DOT headlamps are 55 watt low beam, and 65 watt high beam.  If you have both the high beam and low beam activated, and you still cannot see, you need a driving light or offroad light.  OEM headlights are brighter than this light bar, and throw the light farther down the road.Kit will come with mounting brackets, hardware, and tools.  Wiring harness is okay if you cannot assemble your own relay, switch, and fuse.  Wiring harness will come with a female disconnect, but lamp offers bare wires without a spade connector.  30A fuse is included.You can mount this lamp anywhere as long as you don't mind drilling holes for it.  Trying to mount lamp without drilling is a lot more challenging, but it can be done.  This may not be great compared to current LED technology, but still okay if you compare it to those old 35 watt halogen, auxiliary lights that the local auto supply carries.  At the current selling price, they are practically giving this lamp away.  It cost more to ship it to you than what you will pay.  I will like this until it fails.

Very nice, thick and heavy duty, I'm screwing on the lip of the inside of my truck bed rail to hide under my tonneau cover to strap bungee chords to it as needed, see the attached pic, I used 3/16" self tapping screws with 3/16"  X 1/2 wide flat washers, I installed 5 on each truck bed rail and they sit below my tonneau cover so not to impeach with the operation, it took 15 minute to stall all 10.

Okay, I just updated this review to 5 stars. As we all know, everything is easy when things are smooth...I contacted this seller and he immediately has shipped a replacement light. To me, that is the definition of OUTSTANDING customer service.As for the light itself, very easy install: Unscrew the old taillight assembly, unplug the harness, cut the Red, Black, and Blue wires mid way (leaving room to wire in the plug) then attached the LED's red wire to red, black to black, and the green and blue go together. Plug the harness back in, then screw the assembly back into the fender.  Piece of cake, the light is BRIGHT.

Just installed in my 2008 Toyota 4Runner and they're great! Really bright white and fit just right. I noticed with the original bulbs the fixtures were extremely hot but with the LEDs they stayed cool. I hope they last long but these aren't as expensive as other brands so I'm ok with reordering. My camera on the phone lightens pretty well but the first is the new bulb and the second is the old. Very noticeable difference in person!

I got quite the lesson with this "puller" this morning working on my old 1996 Buick Regal. It's been hit more times than Mike Tyson and I've wanted to pull out some dents without having to pull out the door panels. I've played with suction devices on other applications so took a squirt bottle of window cleaner out with me to help it get a grip. Basically you just wet the area making sure it's clean, press the cup down hard and pull the handles together. That draws the rubber cup up and provides the suction.So how well does it work? It all depends on the surface. You've got to have a five inch diameter flat area or it just won't work. I found a couple of such areas and while it didn't make them perfect, it made them look a lot better. Other areas were just too irregular to provide enough grip as in none at all. It would definitely handle glass easily or pull the screen off an Imac, no problem. No fault with the unit, just takes the proper surface. Once it's locked on you can sure pull the heck out of it without it coming off. It's like a little octopus. Sample for fair review.

Very disappointed with Amazon and these sellers! Everything is made in CHINA! Sellers should have to disclose on product page. Photo looks nice and smooth finish on receiver part. One received is extremely rough and missing paint. Just thrown into product box with no wrapping to protect product. Paint all over inside of cardboard product box! See attached photos of what should be on product description page! Made in China and rough pitted finish. If paint rubs off inside box, will not last with any use! Sending this piece of junk back. The Smittybuilt box looks nice on the front. Creates illusion of quality product! More like from Harbor Freight and not worth $39.00. Why cant these sellers be honest? Notice only 1 photo on item and smooth finish?? False advertising..

I wasn't sure if these would fit on my 2016 Ninja 650 but I took a chance and bought them anyway based on other reviews. They do fit perfectly on my bike. The installation was fairly simple and the instructions were clear. After watching videos on how to remove the fairings I decided to be lazy and just pull the fairings out instead of removing them completely. I removed only four screws which allowed me to pull the fairing away enough to gain access to the bolts without damaging the fairing and without having to remove them completely. It helps to have someone else help to hold the fairing out and a flashlight while you install the sliders. You will need a set of large Allen wrenches and a socket set or box wrench set would be helpful. You will also need a torque wrench and some Locktite would be a good idea as well. The sliders do stick out from the fairing about 1-2 inches as they should to protect the bike.I'm not sure why other reviews were complaining about the slider brackets bending when they dropped their bikes. That's what the sliders are designed to do. I read other reviews where they dropped their bikes while not moving and were upset about the bent brackets. So around 450 Lbs falling from a height of around 3 feet onto a hard surface with the majority of the weight falling onto a single point of impact, not sure why they were expecting anything different but I guess they had a limited understanding of the physics involved.The offset design absorbs the impact in the bracket instead of transferring all of the energy to the bike frame. The brackets in these sliders are aluminum and not steel as the description indicates. Being aluminum is a good thing as steel would not absorb as much of the impact as aluminum will. The result will be a bent bracket in the event of an impact but that's far better than the damage your bike would incur without the sliders. Even if you had to replace the entire slider would you rather spend $100 to replace the slider or much more for your fairing or the entire bike frame?The sliders are well made and the pucks are solid Delrin which is a high abrasion plastic. The design flows well with the bike and they sell color matching pucks which are replaceable. I definitely recommend these frame sliders.

This has three holes/bolts mounting each side, one large and two small, so six bolts total. The small holes holes on one side of the hitch did not line up with the holes on the other side! I had to heat the driver side flange with oxy/acetylene torch red hot and bend outward 1/2 inch in order to line up perfect, I had to measure very precisely. All I can say is, good thing I'm an engineer, otherwise I would have had to ship it back! Had the holes line up, I would have given it 5 stars. I put it on a 2007 Dodge Grand Caravan SE and it is the only one that fits my minivan despite the claims on other hitches - they have to have two ears on either side, if not it won['t fit. I also had to add Gabriel gas shocks to give better load capacity for a bass boat i'm towing, cause it sank down too low to ground.

This has to be my favorite upgrade I did for my 2005 Sportster. Fitment was good, install was easy, and I can see so much better now riding at night.  Would highly recommend if you're looking for an affordable and brighter headlight then stock.

This is a simple on-off switch.  You press the button and it clicks and will stay either on or off.  It does what it is supposed to do. The power leads are reversible and about 5" long.  The base is about 1cm x 1.5cm square.  The switch is not water proof.  The little cover is weather proof, though I had trouble keeping the little rubber cover in place once it was mounted. I like its small size and various mounting options.I am using it on my motorcycle handlebars to toggle a relay which powers some auxiliary spotlights.  It is exposed to vibrations and the rigors of off-road and overland use, plus river crossings and lots of inclement weather, and so far the switch is holding up nicely.  As opposed to other switches I considered before I purchased this one, I especially appreciate the simple and compact design.Beneath the rubber cover is a small male threaded shaft with a round retaining nut to secure it to a flush mount or bracket. See pic.If the rubber boot stayed in place more securely this would be a 5-star review. Oh heck.  Let's make it 5 stars anyway.Edit:  6 months later.It is time for me to buy a few more switches for various things, and I decided to get a few more of these same ones.  I wish I could get the weatherproof covers in different colors, but I am not able to find anything better for my application.

I'm a die-hard car guy and good lighting at night is very critical for me.  These bulbs were a perfect replacement for the stock bulbs in my 2012 Chrysler 300 C.  The stock bulbs were very dim and yellow leaving me straining a bit to see the road at night especially with oncoming traffic head lights.  I also didn't like that the stock bulbs didn't match the white LED surround of the headlights. After putting in these bulbs I can see better, further and with less eye strain...win, win, win!I have Silverstar bulbs in my 2006 Charger SRT-8 and these are far better than those.Worth every penny of the reasonable cost and I have purchased the same type bulbs to replace my fog lights too!The photos show how they look at night on low beam with the stock fog lights (which add a little bit of yellow color).  The photos are taken with my iPhone and unedited other than size and cropping.  Good white light and good illumination of the roadway.  I am very pleased with these bulbs.

Donut gasket is crap. I could tell a little difference in torque.. I had problems with the install with bolts broke the first day and no didn't over tighten them should be spring bolts to have some sort of play instead of being so stiff.. just ordered new ones and doing it the right way instead of going the cheaper route

Very happy so far. First 100 miles are on the new lift. I installed it in my one stall garage with minimal tools. Shipped to me fast and in very good shape. I wish I could understand the directions a little better. A youtube video from rough country would have been nice. But it's still pretty easy.

Purchased this for the Lexus GX 470.  I wasn't aware there was a cabin filter until I check the maintenance log.  This is a great fit.  The instructions are clear on location and how to remove the filter.  The only hard part is to remove the damper cable from the glove box.  Total time to replace the filter was less than 15 minutes.  Super simple, highly recommended.

I purchased for 2007 Jeep Wrangler after a crack developed in the OEM radiator.First, its an extremely tight fit.  In fact, I don't think all the latches on my air box are currently back in place now because I just couldn't close the one closest to the radiator.It wouldnt line up properly upon install. The factory bolts to hold it in place don't line back up properly.Nowhere in the instructions do they mention anything about reusing the fairing from the old radiator but I found out later that you should (I didnt).Its developed a leak on both sides and Ive only had it 5 months.Not Impressed.***UPDATE*** 8/3/2016I'm now on my 3rd Mishimoto Radiator.  The replacement they sent me lasted just a few months longer than the first one.  it developed a crack on the core and had to file another claim.  Ill give them credit on the customer service side.  just send them photographic proof and they send you a new one.  Ill take that credit away as they charge you $30 for shipping every time.***UPDATE*** 12/29/2016I'm now on my 4th Mishimoto Radiator.  At least they cut me some slack on the shipping this time, bonus I guess.  Looking at all the other reviews, clearly there is something wrong here.  This is not how a premium product is supposed to work.

Was not happy with this.  Was not flat on both sides and ended up with a vacuum leak.  Took it off and put it on my CNC and works better then it did before.  This is what it looked like when I got it and you can see the high spots and the low.  It was that way on both sides.

works great for me. No need to modify any of the 5 pins provided.Stock front tire size is a 120/60/17. I have a 120/70/17 (I know, not a HUGE difference) and the front tire is clears a little over an inch off the ground. I added some pictures.My only gripe about the stand is a few of the weld points are not all too great; not that I'm a welding expert (see pics). But obvioously not so bad that it's worth removing a star.5/5 stars for a quality front tree stand for a cheaper price.*edit 6-25-14*Strangely, this product does not allow me to add my images.

Used these as a direct replacement for my fog lights in the 2017 Ram 1500 sport and they work and fit perfectly, plug and play. Very white and very bright. I also installed the 9005 led bulbs in my low beam. They fit just well enough to clpse. the cover on the headlight housing. I had to use a canbus (anti flicker) module on the headlights only, the fog lights didn't flicker or send any error messages.

Dude, some of the guys in these reviews are just babies lol. Be realistic, we all know you get what you pay for! Now these parts are great, not fantastic or magnificent but great. I didn't need any, though it looks like it. Lol I actually need an ABS sensor and they're 65+ at AutoZone and local auto parts stores and the hub bearing is like 100 FOR ONE! So this could have been a $200+ job but I caught these on sale for like $56. Left and right side with ABS sensor. Packaging was pretty bad ads like complete OCD! They get the job done, literally plug and play. If I gotta replace them in a couple year, I'll be right back buying them from here lolSc: Black_dreams91

Decided I needed some air bags. Truck got beat up when the roads got rough when towing my fifth wheel. Especially over bridge transitions and such. Bought the manual fill kit and set it up with the tee connection to fill both at once. Have a compressor and hose in my toolbox wired from the upfitter switches which makes filling the bags effortless and saved a few hundred bucks. Assembling the bags was a bit tricky. I did have to read the directions, but installing them was very easy. The bags are excellent. I run them at zero when not towing and found that 35-40psi is perfect to augment the factory springs when towing my fifth wheel. I've used them for several months now and recently finished a trip from Florida to Maryland towing the fifth wheel over 1000 miles. The bags are great!

My car has been running hot for months. I've flushed it with a garden hose and distilled water several times and it wasn't helping. I ran this for 15 minutes in my driveway and left it sit overnight. I also drove 40 miles with it. I got a ton of nasty crud out after I drained it and my car is back to normal. One problem with any flush is that you may uncover leaks in the system. The crud in mine was blocking a pea size hole in a steel tube. I wrestled the tube out and was able to easily weld it, but not everyone will have the same luck. I'm impressed with how well this worked.

Bought this toilet to replace the same model (but older) unit in our motorhome.  All was as expected.  This is a good toilet and does the job while adding very little weight.  This newer one seems to do a better job when flushing than the old one.  I like the fact that it came in a parchment color as there is no white in our bathroom.

These things look awesome and really light up the night!  Installed them on a 2015 Harley Softail Deluxe and they were plug and play.  Just took out the old lights and put these in.  I did not have to do any alterations to the current set up.  I priced the same lights at Harley and they wanted almost $900.  I can't speak to the longevity of the product since I have only had them for a few weeks, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

This roof bag was a perfect fit on my c320 wagon. It kept our luggage clean and dry through rain. The material looks and feels very high quality. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that the straps are inadaquite for freeway speeds. The front and rear straps worked but the clips holding them together are poor quality and the strap can clip. The side straps are completely useless because the bag only comes with the female half of the clips. Other reviewers already covered this problem so knowing this I used 3 ratcheting straps from home Depot to secure the bag to the car. Have ratcheting straps ready and you won't have any problems with this roof bag.

I used these bulbs in my low voltage landscape lighting. I bought 2 low voltage kits that came with 6 lights and a transformer. The kits included incandescent bulbs. The transformer was limited to a certain wattage output, but I only wanted to use one transformer for 12 lights. 12 lights would have overloaded one transformer. So I decided to try these LEDs. I bought 3 packs so I would have extras for future use if needed. Out of 30 bulbs, I only had an issue with one bulb. One had a bad LED that flickered.I have had these installed for about 8 months. They are used every night on the automatic setting on my transformer. I have not had any fail, some think they are quality made. The light output is very good and they light up my walkway without any other lighting.I plan on using these bulbs for the dashboard lights on an older vehicle as well.

I got this for my 1980s e28 BMW 5-series.  The console in my car is too high to accommodate any of these in-between-holders so I placed it in the passenger door pocket (arm's reach away for the driver) and it fits almost perfectly.  The second cup holder is unusable due to the arm rest being above and in the way, but it can still hold small items (gum, clips, rubber bands, quarters).  The cup holder is large enough to hold not only a venti Starbucks coffee cup but also a 24 oz Hydroflask travel mug.  The center cubicle isn't deep but can hold shorter pens/markers (standard sized writing devices will tumble out).  I may add a thin Styrofoam or sponge inside the door pocket to firm up the stability of this holder.

I'm using these to avoid hyper flash after installing switchback led bulbs in the front of my Mazda 3. Pot tip, if you're only installing led bulbs in the front, you can install these in the back. They'll work same as if they were installed on the front, since it's the same circuit. Ignore the white and green wires in my photos; those are part of my trailer wiring harness.

Looks great, hasn't fallen off in a carwash, and seems to be made from good materials, but the fit was poor.The pros -  price is right, and the look is great.  It seems to be secure, in spite of the bad fit.The cons - the fit was the biggest problem.  No matter what I do, all of the clips will not snap on.  There were three that can't seem to snap into place.  The drivers side bottom corner was the worst.The summary.  I will buy it again if it breaks or falls off.

Bought this to use on the exhaust for my motorcycle, haven't tried yet on the bike but I figured Id use it on some things around the kitchen. Im attaching a pic of a kettle that had some of the most stubborn stains Ive had to deal with. Results are amazing, best of all, its really easy to apply and use. Doesnt take much scrubbing either. Ive had success with NeverDull polish but the wad is limiting and neverdull smells toxic. Autosol has only a slight smell, and you can use any type of abrasive to apply. Works great with the finest steel wool (0000 I think). Im very impressed! Comes in a large tube, I wish it came in a bigger amount cause it actually makes polishing fun!

I have Rock Slide front and rear bumpers and 35" tires on a 2 door JK. The 2 door JK cover was entirely too small. No chance it would fit over the spare on the back. Decided to give the 4 door version a shot and it fits nicely. I live in the DC area so this thing will see just about every type of weather you can imagine. It looks like it will do the job. It seems thick enough to hold up to the elements. I was able to put it on by myself. Comes with a cable and lock. I'll update the review after a couple months of use.

Just installed and so far it's 5 stars! I had to replace mine because for some reason either the little motor in it went bad or some elec issue kept the motor running making a clicking noise and broke off a few teeth in side the actuator. Either way I needed a new one! Just so you know there are 2 actuators in the HAVC systems in the trucks that have the digital controls. One is the Temp/Defrost actuator(located on the left side of the air distribution case) and the other is the Mode Actuator(loacted by the blower motor). This Dorman 604-103 was an exact replacement for my mode actuator(2 pins/wires). There were a few differences in design from my old one and new one (see my uploaded pictures). But it worked fine.Just some tips, There are 2 screws holding these in (9/32 or even 7mm works on'em) and an alignment "nub", wiring just disconnects but you have to squeez and pull on the connector. Also note that you need to dissconnect the battery in order to rest the computer for the new actuator, after waiting 2mins or so reconnect and the key to on/run(not start) and you should be able to hear the actuators moving. I cycled mine throught there ranges to make sure they worked!

I purchased there at Autozone. It was an opened package so they sold it to me for 25.00. I think they where originally 120.00 or some over inflated price...Any way, I bought them and everything was there. It came with the necessary wire and switch for these lights. As think ahead kind of guy, I only used the wires provided to click a relay and used it to sink all the current than the little switch provided. For fun I put purple gels in it for an effect, I later took them out because a cop would have given me a problem.The beams are bright for 55 watts and go far and wide. I like these lights and at about 25.00 it is worth it.

Lifted out some rubber weather mats from a 10yo car... the black had gotten faded/ marked ... i washed them down, no difference... then i used this Trim Restorer on it and the results are amazing. Like back to brand new.I did these mats a month ago and happy to report that they're still looking exactly as per the photos attached. This stuff soaks into rubber and hasn't degraded it and it's kept it shine and smoothness so far.

So this engine start button is as good as it gets for the price that they're being sold for... except for the fact that the one I received had the word "pivot" printed below the words "engine start". As long as this is not a deal breaker for you everything should be fine. The item reached within the time it was supposed to be delivered and it even came with a discount coupon for 15 percent off a future purchase.

Got the product today... (08/25/16) Thanks Amazon Prime! I just installed it into my 2007 Tundra. At first test it woke up my son from his nap. LOL. I just removed battery cable and going to let it sit all night tonight. Tomorrow will be my first street test. Onto the product in the box. I visually inspected the item and it looked like it has been sitting opened in the shelf for years. Dust was all over but hey I wiped it clean and had no issues it. The simple straight forward installation instruction was excellent. I must admit, I am not an auto mechanic. I barely know how to change my car oil, much less. I don't mess with car/ truck, period!. I am an IT Engineer so if I can do this all myself with less than 45 minutes, so can you. Highly recommended.UPDATE: DAY 2 - 8/26/16. I connected my battery back on this morning. Started up the truck, first attempt - started then shut-off immediately (don't worry -- this is normal). Second attempt, started right up. Sounded so beautiful... manly beautiful! Hope I didn't wake up my neighbors at 4 A.M! Took it to the gas station, filled it up... started the truck.. it showed only 141 miles until empty. I was like "WTH!?" then as I drove off, the distance mileage jumped to 444. By the way, I live in Buford, GA and I work at Delta Air line in Hapeville, GA... that's about an hour away with no/ light traffic. Got into the office - checked mileage.. I was down to 388 miles until empty (59 miles one way)... very normal commute.. Here is the biggest surprise: Anyone who drives a 2007 Tundra V8 5.7L especially with 157K miles on it knows that a full tank of gas with stock intake will give you 330 miles until empty (top). Living proof, mine is like that (well, was like that). Now it jumped from 330 to 444! Believe it or not, I am loving it! Highly recommended. Follow instruction and you will be just fine. Good luck to new buyers and everyone ... just because we now got that extra horse kick in our trucks doesn't mean we drive hard.. stay safe on the road and stay sober! Peace!

Only used this thing for a few days so far but it's bright for the price! See my pics. You can't compare this to something that costs $200, $500, or the $1500  level; that wouldn't make sense. For the price its bright! It has been pouring rain the last week we had it out and there is no moisture inside, but I used some windshield sealer all the way around the glass since some of the reviews stated that was a problem (see picture below). I bought the 36" specifically so I was able to mount it between the bars on my roof rack so there's no wind noise and it doesn't scream, "Steal Me!" I'll update in the future if anything burns out or if any moisture gets in it. If you don't hear from me then it's still doing great! I couldn't be happier for this price!The first three pics I'll explain, the rest are self explanatory.1) Low beams2) Low beams plus light bar3) Low and high beams4) Low beams, High beams, and Light bar: DAYLIGHT. I could see every thing all the way down the road and everything all around the car. It lit up a few dear eyes that were on the side of the road, so that was nice to get warning about.

I use this coupler lock on a large double axle concession trailer we use for grilling in the community to feed 100+ people at a time. Works great when coupled with a good discus padlock. Make sure your discus palock will fit the hole in the rod though. Mine fits as you can see in the pic. I haven't had any theft issues so far. Seems like a good value for the money invested. I feel it is a good deterrent to the thief that isn't hell bent on stealing trailers. If they want it bad enough and have enough time, even the best of locks won't stop em'. But this is a big annoying in your face shiny thing that screams "go try one that's easier to take". Works well. If you found this review HELPFUL, please check YES. Thanks much :)

First let me say that this hitch appears to be very substantial. It was exactly what I was looking for to install on my Ford Explorer 2015. I asked the dealer about getting a Ford OEM hitch and they told me the cost would be $795. So at $125 this is a bargain. I'm sure that you could probably find an installed hitch elsewhere for $300-$400 but I figured I'd do it myself and save the money.Before I purchased this hitch and decided to install it myself, I took a look at the many videos that Curt has on YouTube. In fact, I found the exact video for installing this hitch on my 2015 Explorer. Watching the video is what made me decide to install it myself. It looked pretty easy.Frankly, being north of 55 years old, it wasn't as easy as the video made it out to be. I don't really blame Curt or Ford, it was because I was doing the installation in my driveway without the benefit of a lift or for that mater without the benefit of raising the Explorer in any way. Because the video was so good, I didn't even need to read the directions for installation and in fact found when I glanced at the instructions, that following the video would be easier. Everything went according to plan. The reason I say that it wasn't as easy to install was because I did not lift the Explorer it was hard to get the required fulcrum to get the muffler hangers off. I struggled with that for about an hour but I was finally successful. It I had the Explorer on a lift then my installation would have gone exactly like the video from Curt showed.With all that said, it took me 2 hours to get it installed. After installation I think it looks great! In fact my previous vehicle was a Ford Escape with a factory installed hitch and that one certainly didn't look as good as this. So for light towing I have to highly recommend this made in the U.S.A. product and highly recommend Curt's exceptional installation videos for just about every make and model of vehicle.

Fits perfectly on my 2004 Explorer XLS (4.0L SOHC).  It's the short hose on the front bottom of the thermostat housing.  Costs too much for such a short piece of hose, though.

These are really nice, and add a bit of flare to the wheels. These fit very tight in the center cap, and that's a good thing. There's a metal ring that sits inside the tines to keep them from caving in, and ensures they stay tight. These fit my 01 RAM Sport 4x4 17" stock wheels perfectly, and look better than the stock aluminum looking ones (both the original and these, are plastic), and I would order them again. The only reason I give 4 stars and not 5, is that one of the 4 was received with a broken tine in the box. Not a deal breaker, as these are just one more detail that adds a nice look.

Great price for these for my 2004 Santa Fe.  I know that there was a split year and I knew my car had the newer headlights so I just ordered these for a 2005 and super easy to install.  Unfortunately they are not aimed whatsoever, headlights point at the mountaintops and blind other drivers.  there are small adjustment screws on the backs, fiddly adjusting them but well worth it.  Also, they come pre loaded with headlight bulbs and turn signal bulbs, what a plus!

Took a ride with my new helmet today and it was all that was advertised. Fit was perfect & most comfortable helmet I've ever owned. The cut back sides are amazing with no blocked vision at all. Wind noise: small amount at 65/70. But what the heck, your on a motorcycle. I went to a dealer to check size then ordered from Amazon. This way I was sure on size & color. Plus, Amazon was $35 cheaper. Pleased in every way.

These things are beefy. I went with powder coated as I planned on welding them to my trailer and didn't want to deal with zinc oxide fumes. I like these over weld on D rings as those rattle and make noise.

Easy to install & works. I am still using the tennis ball since this is the easiest way to track driving into the garage. The laser shifted a little and is unnoticeable but I will leave it installed . Instead of using the 6V power supply I connected the wires to the garage door sensor. It works better this way since the power will shut off after 1min and turn on anytime the door sensor is broken. I can see why the seller has the power pack in the package so that the laser will stay on at all times. I didn't test the 6V power supply to see if there is a built in timer for the laser unit. Another laser garage installation manual shows that the unit can be installed in the terminals for the safety sensors. If you look at my photo its the terminals on the right rear of the garage door opener. The gray terminal is + and the white is -. The output voltage is 6VDC. The only thing is that some people may not like is that the laser guide will not come on until the garage door sensor is broken. Other than that this is a good unit to have if you are in a very tight spot.

Replaced all the exterior lighting on my travel trailer.  Bought Optronix #66 marker lights (dual light fixture) in total of 13 fixtures (26 bulbs).  Price was important.  I also wanted LED lights that were similar to the original 193 bulbs, and these have filled the bill but not without their problems.  Overall, I am pleased with the resulting light output.  I wasn't looking for something that would burn my retinas and allow me to read fine print legalese at 20 paces.  I just needed something that would properly illuminate marker lights without blinding other drivers.Most importantly, if you are using fixtures that have 2 bulbs, make sure that the lights are not able to contact the mounting screws.  I smelled something burning, on a breezy day, and found that one of the lights had failed within 10 minutes.  Since I still had 14 spares, I replaced it.  After finishing the replacement, I went back and performed a post-mortem on the failed bulb.  What I think happened is that the 'decks' on the bulb are connected to each other using a very fine wire.  You can just see the connection if you look extremely closely at an actual bulb.  This bulb's interconnect had contacted a mounting screw, which is attached to the metal skin of a travel trailer (and therefore grounded) which caused it to short out.  The first pic shows how close the bulbs can come.  Second pic shows my potential short mediation by applying squares of electrical tape over the screws...just in case.  Third pic is of the damaged light bulb itself.  Since I didn't analyze until all lights were done, I didn't pay attention how close it was to the mounting screw.  I will just chalk this one up to an oops incident, and learn from it.Last pic is a bulb manufacturing error.  There are two (germanium?) diodes in the base of the bulb.  The bulb in the pic only has 1 diode, and a piece of wire extending from the +/positive contact to the bulb base.  This bulb was also beginning to smell 'cooked'.  Though it was still working, I went ahead and changed it.  I just happened to catch the error while adding tape to the rest of the fixtures.Two more pics...front and back of trailer.  What you are seeing is not a reflection of the camera flash, but the light of the bulbs.  Perhaps a bit on the bright side, but I am happy.

This junk gauge gave me an injury, used it only times and from the first minute it gave me a hard time, it came with an inaccurate low side ( Blue ) guage and it needed to be reset because the needle was above zero ( I considered it not a big deal ), 2nd ... when attaching the yellow feeding line to the gauge itself, the o-ring came loose and wasted 1 hour of my time trying to find it in the engine bay ... first use was light ( Puling vacuum into the system ) .. 2nd use was to recharge the system and here we go ... all connectors were hand tightened ... never over tightened ( I'm handy and i work on cars since over 15 years ...while recharging i felt my hand is freezing so fast and the low pressure was just going up and then down to much lower than the point where i started !! which indicates a leak, since my system was under vacuum test for over a week and it can hold 29 inch of Merc for one week straight .. that means that the fault is somewhere in the manifold gauge itself  .. unfortunately the engine noise didn't allow me to hear the Hess coming from the yellow line connector ( where it's connected to the refrigerant bottle ) ... i shut the car off, and took a close look at the connector ... it was leaking and the refrigerant sprayed on my face and lips, it even reached my right eye from underneath the safety glasses .. i'm gonna see my doctor today because my lips hurt me so bad ... so this gauge will cost me it's price + my injury + doctor bill + breathing refrigerant ...

These 5100 Bilstein shocks are the final touch when also installing the 2" adjustable front Bilstein 5100 struts. These shocks are valved to handle lifted trucks. They are also about 1" longer than the factory shocks. These are a direct fit.Very easy to install!I do recommend the Bilstein 5100 shocks and struts as they are a huge improvement over the stock suspension.CPS

Wow. I have the expensive Grab bars in my JKU, but thought I'd try these in my JK - to save quite a few dollars. Excellent product, and I highly recommend these to anyone who loves keeping in their Jeep. They make it extremely easy to climb in and out.  These bars are really easy to install, and they now come with excellent instructions - and tips.

The product performed flawlessly. I applied it to the many chips on my black paint. I then wheeled out the entire car before applying Cerama Kote ceramic coating. My car looks amazing with no paint chips. I even won a Good Guys Modern Muscle award at the recent Good Guys Spring Nationals in Scottsdale, AZ. Much of that was because the chips were gone and my car looked like it had a new paint job.

Just installed these light on my 16 VW Jetta and they look great. They are just a little taller than the stock light bulbs but I have more than enough room.My car does check for burn bulbs and these don't trigger the system so they are definitely error free.I don't know about the 1000 lumen light they claim to have because I can't measure that but they do make a great difference and they light a lot more and I like the white look more than the yellow light.Attached is a view of my rear view camera with stock lights, only the right JDM light changed, and finally both rear lights with JDM ASTAR lights.

Great value, easy install and much needed added storage for a 2011 Honda CRV.I purchased this rack in the Spring 2015 to increase the cargo space of my CRV. We camp and go to the beach often and this rack has been a blessing. I have placed beach chairs, luggage, a tent/tarps and other odds and ends up there and secured with tie down straps without a worry. Traveled hundreds of highway miles without any issues. Be careful as the bolts are long and can damage the gear in the rack (see picture). I wish Highland would sell an extension. Some minor rusting on the bolts but it has survived heavy use so far.

If you are trying to keep your paint looking good but still have fun on the trails then these are the ticket. Just be sure to store them flat, I put mine on a shelf in the garage, and they will be fine. I Clean the Jeep and put them on the night before we hit the trails. They have saved my paint so much. Look at how scratched up they are. That would have been my door!

This does not work, I replaced the flasher relay on my 98 Jeep Wrangler with this so I could install led lights.  I replaced my turn signals with led's and my stock flasher relay with this and hyper flashing, does not work.  The flasher sent is not an led flasher like the picture shows, but just a standard flasher.

This thing literally crumbled in my hands - snapped at the hinge.  Upon closer inspection I found two things had failed on it.  The set screw at the hinge (Philips-head screw, and a Philips-head nut) was manufactured with stripped threads, the Philips-head screw fell out and would not re-thread, even by hand.  When the screw backed itself out and fell under the car, the remaining part of the hinge had too much pressure and snapped.  Of course the socket that broke was the one I needed - and I was miles from my main toolbox.  The only good news is I discovered this within a week of purchase, I'll be sending it back.  I don't want another of these, even if it's free.Imagine if you were stuck on the side of the road, at night, in the rain with tools that break within the first 10 minutes of use.  Safety hazard.

Great lights. Honestly be prepared to do some custom wiring, I had to cut the wires to do a professional clean install and route the wires how I wanted them. I needed to add extra wire to the drivers side and buy extra wire conduit for the added wire. All in all they are nice lights but don't go in thinking your gonna throw them ok and call it a day unless you don't care if it looks sloppy.

It fits nicely and is easy to install and seems to be of good quality.However, it is NOT metal, it's plastic.  More of a problem though is the fact the the shade of silver (or metal finish) does not match any of the adjacent colors.  It stands out.  This is the biggest negative.  In fact, the picture depicts it accurately.  I will add my own picturesI wish it was the same finish and blended more seamlessly with the surrounding

Awesome kit! Everything was 100% plug and play on my 2013 f150. I love that I have puddle lights now. Highly recommend. My only complaint is that the fit isn't 100 percent toward the bottom of the housing where it meets the door. However for this price and not being OEM, I'm totally fine with it. Saved a lot of money!

This latch was flimsy made from Rugged Ridge, but I installed it anyway.  Three weeks later the rubber arm split and it failed on the highway.  Fortunately, I still had one OEM latch on opposite side, or this would have caused an accident.  Stay away from this China made defective product--it is very unsafe.

Pros:1) Lights and grommets fit the pro series cargo carrier snugly2) Very easy install and everything worked without any fuss3) Looks nice and quality seems OK, doubt lights would survive being submerged, would recommend wrapping connections with electrical tape to protect themCons:1) No way (without cutting/splicing) to route the leads from the lights directly from the light to under the carrier and along the underside of the frame. You have to route it either over the top or around the outside of the frame which looks goofy but also exposes the cable to direct contact wear/tear.2) They don't include enough zip ties to route the cables neatly, no biggie if you have some lying around.3) The worst (and reason for two starts instead of four): the lead for the driver side light isn't long enough to route the cable anywhere but a straight diagonal over the top of the carrier, unless you just happen to keep about two feet of spare length available on your vehicle's pigtail. Passenger side is long enough with some to spare. Really stupid oversight, now need have to cut/splice in an extension to route it underneath so my luggage doesn't shred the cable. Might as well do it on both sides so I can run the lines directly under the carrier from the lights to avoid Con #1. See pic.

fit my 2005 Silverado 1500 crew cab no problem. Plug and play - took maybe 15 minutes to install.I had LED taillights already installed, so this completed the brake light upgrade. First issue I had was the cruise control went out after installing this part. I emailed the manufacturer and they were no help and "never heard of that before".I should have just Google'd the problem in the first place - turns out due to the low resistance in LEDs, the system in the truck thinks the brake lights are burnt out so you cannot use cruise.I had to purchase 50w 6ohm resistors on Amazon and splice one of them into the light blue and black wires behind the high mount light. Cruise came back on.A few weeks go by and I still have cruise, however I took my car through a touchless car wash and then looked at the light. Tons of condensation. I made sure I tightened it down so no air could get it from the seal, but somehow this this fogged up (and had water beads inside the unit itself). I'll give it a few more washes to see if it continues, if so I'll have to warranty it out. I'm writing this a few days after the car wash and there are still water beads/fog in the unit, but it's still lighting up.key points:Looks great (very bright)quick plug-play installyou could loose cruise if you have other LED lightsbe careful in car washesUPDATE:I had to replace it under warranty because of the issue above. I'm on my second unit. Today I noticed standing water inside the assembly. It's been 5 months.It still lights up but water & condensation are again in the unit.It's literally two screws to mount this, so I'm not sure what others here are doing differently than I am? Hopefully I can get it exchanged for a 3rd one under warranty...If I could do it again - I would keep the original assembly and install LED lights with a resister. At least my original one from 2005 never took in water!

Fits very well in a 2007 Subaru Impreza Sti. Tucks in nicely, sites below the center console level. The drivers side is a little wider than the passenger. Useable width is about 3/4-1" on the drivers side and 3/8-1/2" on the passenger side. Holds phone, notepad, pens, glasses in a case, etc very well. Very happy with them. They even have red threading to match the STi!

Same cheap plastic parts will break again and again. Window regulators are simple to remove and install. Don't pull the glass out. Just use a wire coat hanger as hooks from the top of the rail once you have removed the door cover and switch connectors. Now do your inspection work. 99.9% of the time a cheap plastic part that fits into the vertical slide plate has broken. The cable rarely breaks the motors hardly even go bad. So what are you paying for here? You are paying for a complete regulator with motor because honda used two cheapo plastic parts known to fail. There is presently a class action suit against Honda for these always breaking parts. No matter what brand you put in, they will break. I was hoping that Dorman would have fixed the flaw but Noooooooo, these break even faster. My Honda element front windows play musical breakdown one followed by the other.The way this fracture occurs is the plastic guide hook breaks first. This causes an ever so slight wobble in the window and you will notice some additional slight noise and jerkyness when the window is opened and closed. Then one day when you don't need to be handed a low of whatever... the cable seat will break and one of the cable ends will release and your window will fall down. Congrats mission of planned obsolescence is complete. This is now so common that you can now purchase a whole new regulator without the motor. That will save you about half. Don't think you are gong to fix this slide plate. The nylon was cast into the punched metal. To build one that wouldn't break would require an entire machined part with separate nylon or delrin parts. But don't think you are alone. The Honda Pilot window regulators slide plate is essentially identical and breaks constantly. Dorman uses the same slide plate so their part will fail due to the Honda Design flaw. Keep your receipts. If the class action goes through Dorman will have to pay and they will collect from Honda. How does it feel to be taken for a ride by Honda?

My parents have a 1999 Buick Lesabre.  Mom was complaining about radio reception, wasn't getting any stations.  After researching it figured it was this part and ordered it before they came out to visit (they live 350 miles away).  When they arrived I tried the radio out and it seemed fine but I replaced the part anyways in case it was flaky.  Nothing was melted on it or the connectors.It installs easily and is located on the passenger side on the column next to the rear windshield.  I attached a picture, all you need to do is pop the white rivet loose and you can get to this part.

I used this product to refinish the outside door mirror on my kids 1997 Honda Accord.  The mirror now looks good as new!The original mirror got knocked off.  Teenagers!  I bought a used mirror but it needed refinishing.  I bought the primer, paint and clear coat all in the same brand, PlastiKote, to reduce the risk of compatibility problems.1) Primer:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PlastiKote-467-Gray-Flexible-Spot-Filler-and-Primer-12-Oz/dp/B002QC8VLK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PlastiKote 467 Gray Flexible Spot Filler and Primer - 12 Oz.</a>2) Paint:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PlastiKote-1078-Honda-Heather-Mist-Metallic-Automotive-Touch-Up-Paint-11-oz/dp/B0045YSSN8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PlastiKote 1078 Honda Heather Mist Metallic Automotive Touch-Up Paint - 11 oz.</a>3) Clear coat:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PlastiKote-1000-Universal-Clear-Coat-Automotive-Touch-Up-Paint-11-oz/dp/B0045YJDVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PlastiKote 1000 Universal Clear Coat Automotive Touch-Up Paint - 11 oz.</a>I chose the "flexible" primer because it was for an ABS plastic part. I lightly sanded the mirror and washed it before I used the primer. I used several coats and sanded between them. The primer worked well and filled in the small nicks and scratches in the old paint. The primer provided a good base for the next step of "Touch-Up Paint".The touch-up paint went on well.  I started with a very light "tack" coat followed by several more thin coats.  The complex curves were challenging to cover and I had one small run.  However, I sanded that drip, re-painted and all was well.I then followed with several layers of the "Universal Clear Coat".All the spray nozzles performed well. I did not have any trouble with sputtering paint.  No orange peel.  The color match to the car was perfect.  The metallic paint sparkled well underneath a deep gloss.The mirror has now been in daily use for five months and the finish and gloss still look excellent!

It came neatly vacuum packed in a box.  The quality seems to be better than some reviews stated.  For the reasonable price, it exceeds my expectations.  I read complaints that there were no mirror pockets.  Not so with this one.  My only complaint; which is more of a comment that a complaint, is that I needed to remove my antennae rather than cut a hole for it. I probably will cut it because I'm mostly just trying to keep dust off of the truck.  This one fits quite well on a 2013 Ram 1500 Laramie Crew Cab.  I would buy it again

Bought two of these to replace the original front end links on a 1994 ES300 while chasing down a clunking/rattling noise up front. Each "kit" contained one K90124 end link, two 15mm nuts, and two preinstalled zerk grease fittings. The product seems beefy and well built. Mine says built in Mexico, not Japan. As others have mentioned, it is a flat dark gray rather than the gold colored (zinc chromate?) finish shown in the product photo. I'll include some pics including one of the old factory and the new Moog part. I had previously installed the rear end links,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Moog-K90313-Stabilizer-Bar-Link-Kit/dp/B000C5611A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Moog K90313 Stabilizer Bar Link Kit</a>&nbsp;in 2013 and they are holding up fine.Note: I found that when tightening down the removable nut, the wrench used to hold the rear 18mm fixed nut (that stops the bolt from spinning) needs to be relatively thin or it will mash down into the flexible grease boot. I didn't notice any damage, but it could possibly compromise the boot.

It's hard to go wrong with a basic chunk of metal with no moving parts.  The critical issues with such an item are quality of alloy, fit, finish and, in this case, weld.This Taiwan-made Wilmar (a.k.a. Performance Tool brand) product seems to be of high quality.It's heavy and, considering it's hollow, I believe this is probably decent quality alloy.  The minimum thickness of the socket is 1/8".The finish is nice and even.  There's a small spot of missing finish (bare metal) on the drive end of mine which made it past QC.The weld job (socket to handle) appears very well done; see my pic.  The joint is true and and smooth.  It seams (pardon pun) that an automated welding lathe was involved.The tool features a diamond grip; it's difficult to see in the Amazon image, so I posted a better one.The socket fit my new Motorcraft 1 5/16" rods like a glove, with almost no play.  With rod inserted normally, the tool's socket covers 1 1/16" (5/8" of the flats) of the nut.  The rod end is visible, but does not encroach upon the drive pocket.My first impressions of this tool were quite favorable, especially given the much lower price as compared with equivalent versions from high-end brands.update 10-26-13:It worked as advertised, but there are a couple of issues I faced which others may run into:1.  I had to go to the extra trouble of disconnecting the sway/stabilizer bar links so that I could pivot the sway bar up out of the way in order for this tool to be slid over the new tie rod nuts.  It couldn't be used without getting that sway bar out of the way.  This is, of course, vehicle dependent and YMMV.2.  Using this type of tool can be a 2-man job.  Torquing down without counter compensation (i.e., a wrench on the rack gear) can damage the steering gear.  This is not too much of an issue on the driver's side, since the two wrenches are near one another -- it still takes a good bit of muscle; my vehicle was not on a lift and I had to use my foot to push on a crescent wrench which was on the rack (you'll want to use a fairly large wrench) while torquing down the tie rod.The passenger side is another story.Unless the vehicle is on a lift, it can be exceptionally difficult if not impossible to apply counter to the rack flat while torquing down the passenger side tie rod.  Even with the vehicle on a lift, the user may find it difficult to impossible to do alone, largely due to the distance between wrenches.However, for installing either side, a ratcheting wrench (crescent type or open-end) or crows foot on a ratchet handle could be set in place to keep the rack still, if there's room for doing this on a given vehicle and the ratchet tooth spacing (handle arc) permits it.

Purchase this item to use as a guide for a barn door in our pantry. This door isn't very thick or heavy so it tends to swing back and forth when we open and close it. This guide is plastic and adjustable. I installed it on the baseboard close to the end of the door run when it is closed. With the addition of a small wheel on the door, it now rolls shut more easily and keeps the door from swing and hitting the baseboard or door frame. We have a thicker barn door elsewhere that required a heavier duty guide (metal).

Tis is a great add on for my 2011 F350 power stroke. Installed easily in 30 to 45 min. Can be installed on the left or right side of the tail gate. I  suggest putting it all together for a dry fit so you know how and where it falls out .  I see a lot of reviews about the instructions not being correct so I did not use them. Easy to figure out without the instructions.  Love this latter and I plan on maintaining it by spraying it with black paint  every so often to stop rust .

This panel works really well in my teardrop camper.  It takes a little investigation to figure out how to wire it, but it's quite easy when you find good instructions.  Also, you have to buy the breakers separately, but you can find them at any home improvement store.Here is one tip that may save you some time.You will need a DC busbar to land the negative side of your DC circuits.  The panel has 12 wires coming out of it for the 12v positive, but you have to run the negative to the busbar and run a wire back to the panel.Google "wiring diagram PD4045" and you'll find the picture I included.  It was very helpful for me.

I purchased this pack of relays due to the price and what they are going to be used for. I have 5 devices on my golf cart where a standard switch would not hold the amperage. My plan was to make a panel to mount it all on to make it neat as possible. When they arrived I quickly noticed that each socket has a male and female slide. What this means is I can connect as many of these together as possible. This makes mounting them easy and clean looking. This wasn't mentioned in the add and should be (probably sell more). Also on the bottom of each relay it looks to be sealed which is also a plus.

Workes very very good, also had can bus canceler builtin, Installation was a breeze, for H7 model and maybe some other you have to twist the bulb out of the bracket install bracket with car head light clips then twist bulb back into bracket... if you don't do this it will be very difficult to fit in place... lost a star because the wire is NOT pre harnessed so you will have to splice wires......Update 5/30/2015Both Died in less than a year, smh..... because of this I not take it from 4 stars to 1

5 stars so far. It remains to be seen if they hold up to rain and vibration on my motorcycle.The hue of light on my set is acceptable, bordering on pleasing; they might be 6K as they are so named... I almost cant see any blue. Less blue for sure than the "Gizmo" set ( also available on Amazon ) I tried recently and discarded. They are very bright, focused, and have a good throw.  I shot myself in the eye with one like an idiot while fitting them and had to actually stop working for a bit to give the white-out of my retina time to reset itself. They look mild unless you are staring right down the barrel of them so to speak, because of the tightness of the beam. Don't be fooled.... and don't look straight into it like I did. To give a rough idea of the output, my bike has an H4 bulb with a hacked switch so I can burn the high and low filaments at the same time. If these LEDs are on, I can put the H4 on high, low, or both and I cant even tell that its working. Cant even see it change states low/high.  Its 100% blown out by these LEDs. Its just shocking how little light it throws when I turn off the LEDs due to approaching cars. Think of the wall of light in front of rally cars at night. These are close.Unlike a lot of the cheapies here on Amazon these do actually have reflectors, not just a plastic cone shaped fitment, so there is a focused light and not a broad scatter. The focus is remarkable at this price, even though they did a poor job of centering the LEDs in the reflectors.The base has a range of adjustments; you can tilt the light on the base up and down, and raise the light up and down a cm or two which may help with centering the light on a vehicle's fascia. Also you can reverse the base so the mounting screw is either more under the light or towards the rear, AND the base itself has a slot which allows a sideways adjustment approx 1cm to either side from center. The tilting screws thread directly into the housing, but the holes for them on either side are a pass-through all the way through the housing, so if you ever strip out the aluminum you can substitute a bolt that goes all the way through and clamp it with a bolt and nut.The construction looks good; the castings have very few pits and no missing parts, and its covered nicely in a black coating that is probably not durable at all but looks good for now. The lenses are clear and distortion free. Again... for now. Some of this cheap imported stuff can degrade quickly in ways you might not expect. I hope these don't as they are pretty much spot on what I was hoping to add to my bike and they were at a fair price for what they are.My one complaint is the power leads are less than two feet long... they should have made the leads longer. You can always cut off some if you don't need it and for the few cents it costs it would save people who need longer lines the trouble of extending them. I didn't have to extend mine but they were almost precisely the length needed. I got lucky.EDIT: About 10K miles and 11 months of daily commuting later, they still function as new and the appearance of the casing and lenses hasn't degraded in the slightest. They held up to love bugs no problem. Excellent.

Excellent product. Easy to install, only need wrenches. One tip I would give is to have something heavy about the fastener plugs when tightening them down. I used this up and down now and it works as advertised. Robust and sturdy construction. Doesn't seem to stop all water from getting in the bed... not sure if it is something I got wrong installing it. Wish it was a little cheaper...

Do not use this for pre-paint prep! IT WILL CAUSE FISH EYE! I used this twice, I assumed the rag was the source of my problem, after the second round of fish eye, I stoped using this product and fish eye was gone. Others have told me they had no problem, but I know for a fact it will cause epoxy primer to fisheye.

If you're not a big fan of big or weird looking car antennas and think less is more the "Stubby" makes an excellent replacement for your OEM car antenna.Install is dead simple just removing the original and screwing in the Stubby which has a virtually flush fit with the Volt's black antenna base.So far I haven't noticed any difference in reception with the smaller antenna, nor has it caused any issues.Only thing that keeps it from a 5/5 in my opinion is the cosmetic small gold branding saying "TheStubby" on the antenna which I received vs the pictured one (See my customer photo).  It would have been much more professional and clean looking without.

This is the most professional kit you can buy.Everything has a professional feel about it. The first thing I did, was use one of the supplied Allen wrench to make certain all four Allen screws were tight on both metal T handles.I have used it at least ten times already.Easy to use and here's how:Step 1: Make certain you have at least 20psi of air in the tire because it will work easier and then locate the nail, screw or object and verify that it is leaking as shown in photo #1.Step 2: Before removing the object put some of the provided lube on the tip of the spiral probe saw tool and set it aside so it is ready and you don't lose much air trying to lube it later as shown in photo #2. This tool is used to basically clean and widen the hole.Step 3: Remove the screw or object and quickly insert the spiral saw into the hole pushing it all the way in and then pull and twist the saw in and out  about 4 times without actually allowing the tool to come all the way out of the tire and then stop and leave it in the hole so that you won't loose much air while preparing the t handle inserting tool as show in photo #3Step 4: Put one of the string plugs through the tip of the insert tool and pull half way through until both ends are equal distance away from the tip and pull both ends down towards the Handle. Then apply some lube to allow for a smooth and easy insertion as shown in photo #4.Step 5: Push the string plug into the hole with the T- handle insertion tool until about 1/4" of the sting plug remaining and then pull the insertion tool out with one swift pull as shown in photo #5. "The round metal part on the insertion tool is to use if your having a problem with the plug wanting to come out when you pull the tool out but I've never had to use that yet."Step 6: Use Diaganal wire cutters, knife or a razor blade to trim off the remaining plug as close to the tire as possible as shown in photo #6 and #7.Photo # 8 is a view of everything that comes in the kit. I love the case so I can keep everything organized.

Installed on a 2016 Chevy 3500HD using a DeeDee DZ92740X fuel tank/toolbox combo. Everything fit fine, plenty of hose, correct sizes of hose. Only issue I seen is the valve when screwed into the fuel tank bottoms out about the same time the valve handle hits the bung. I used a file to file down the valve handle a bit and now it does not bind. Dee Zee should include a short nipple to simplify the installation. Still have yet to fuel the tank to see if the check valve works correctly.

I have a black car and enjoy washing it myself. I have a million products from Chemical Brothers, Mcquires, Griot , Mothers etcIn anear impossible attempt to not put swirls in my car I purchased this. Given I use the two bucket wash method with high quality mitts and rinse the car with powerwasher before I even start I know the swirls were coming from the drying process. Even with the best drying towels or waffle towels I wasn't happy with end result.  This used correctly does.seem to help and essentially allows the towel to glide easier while still getting the water off. I spray a bit on the microfiber, than the car and gently wipe changing the towel a couple times. Definitely saves time but I am not convinced it is doing much more than a good detail.spray.  It leaves a shine like the detail spray but also seems to give the lubrication a bit more to help with swirls. I have a white car and to be honest see no difference between this and mcquires detail.spray but on a black car it works better than anything I have tried.  UPDATE-. This really is great while drying saving time and eliminating swirls caused by dragging towels across fresh washed car

This kit really needs clear tubing like others have mentioned, you really need to see the volume and condition of fluid while priming, I went to Ace hardware and bought 2 ft of 5/16 clear tubing for 38 cents - no big deal.  The adapter sizes included in this kit are:  Thread Size: 7/16-24, 1/2-20, 9/16-18, 9/16-20 Inch And M8-1.25, M10-1.25, M10-1.0, M11-1.50, M12-1.0.  The Ford master cylinder that I was using this kit for uses two sizes M10-1.0 and M12-1.0 - so I lucked out purchasing only 1 kit.  I used teflon tape to seal the adapter threads and everything worked out very well.  3 stars for black tubing otherwise I would have rated it 4 stars for clear tubing and I would have given it 5 stars if they doubled up on the adapters to include 2 of everything even if they charged a little more.  It all boils down to this - I paid 10 bucks for two plastic adapters ;(

Very happy with these handles. Very strong Velcro and 3 nice wide straps to wrap around your roll bar. Mine had none of the loose threads mentioned in some reviews. The plastic handle is really comfortable with no seams or burrs. One note; definitely take off your freedom panels to install these. The look is so much cleaner and the fit a lot better. Highly recommended!

Arrived fast and very easy to install. I was impressed with the hardware that was included, as the items were separately bagged and labeled with OEM p/n and list. The hardware included new screws to secure the radiator to the frame, but note that these are aluminum and may snap easily if you use too much torque (you can always use your originals). The hardware did not include new screws for the fan housing. My only real issue was putting the original screws back through the fan housing into the radiator. They didn't want to fit at first, but with some extra pressure I was able to work them in.

When I say these things are bright, I mean it. Bought these for my 06 Toyota Sienna with CK sockets and they work well. The Yellow is super bright and the white is much brighter. Wish I got pics of what it looked like on a dark road. They easily light up the street, but still use your headlights. I did test it out and I liked the color, will be looking for headlights and highbeams to match. The white lights, light up the road better then Daytime running lights (shouldn't drive with those anyway) and half as good as lowbeam, they lack the distance.I took picks with stocks on passenger and leds on the driverside. Then replaced passenger with LED's as well.I tested these on a 9V battery as well and wow! Enjoy the pics, while I enjoy the lights.Update (7/20/2017): Been over a year and still going strong. I did have one go out about a few weeks in, but JDM ASTAR replaced it no questions asked. Even spoke with them over the phone and they were very helpful. Looking to do the same with my 13 Toyota Venza with CK sockets. Since these should fit I will test them out before purchasing just to make sure. Keep up the good work JDM ASTAR

Make sure you install this while it's not humid out so you won't have letters stuck on the paper. Also, it's on my windshield at the very top.

No performance gain, just security assurance.My previous shackles were rusted bad (see pic).Had to tourch the bushing then press it off the leaf spring. I used an O2 Sensor Socket to press it out. It was a pain in the butt; but that's because I have Rust issues (Salt Roads out in the North East).

Ultimately I'm glad I went with this product over an aerosol based caliper paint solution.  While I almost took one star off for the poor quality paint brush that is included and the fact that this is a little harder to get a good clean finish out of your paint job if you don't mix the paint CONSTANTLY as you're applying it and apply it sparingly and with lots of patience.  These are all things that can be easily overcome.For instance, the poor quality brush looses some of it's bristles almost from the get go.  If you tug on the end of the bristles and play with it, most of the loose bristles will come out almost immediately improving your chances of not getting one loose and stuck on the paint as you paint the caliper.  The fact that you don't need a primer is excellent.  However, don't let that fool you, you still need to properly clean the caliper and remove any previous paint or finish if you want to this look right and have a higher chance of sticking properly.  Also the fact that this paint requires an activator makes it stronger and more durable in my opinion.  But you need to constantly be mixing it as you're applying it, not just initially after pouring in the activator into the paint.  This keeps it from coagulating and causing uneven application of the paint unless you're interested in wet sanding and polishing it later to a brilliant shine which is otherwise not necessary.Also, this kit comes with everything you need to do this job.  Enough paint to paint 4 calipers at least 3 coats each.  The paint comes in a container large enough to mix without spilling or even risk of spilling as you mix.  Activator so the paint is only ready to be applied when you're ready to do this job.  Non-chlorinated brake cleaner to aid in cleaning the calipers prior to painting.  Paint brush that is usable though you need to either get your own at Home Depot or Lowes or prep this one as stated above.  A Popsicle stick for mixing.  And instructions as well as a G2 decal if you want to use it.Applying this paint is straight forward, maybe easier than an aerosol spray paint.  But you do still need to take your time and be very careful how you apply it thinly but in multiple coats to get everything good and not get runs or orange peel.  I do think this paint will end up being stronger than the aerosol type of paints and protect against brake dust and other road grime and the environment in general.  So I rated this product 5 stars despite it's few weaknesses.  I would definitely buy again and highly recommend.

I never used the fog lights on my 2016 GMC Denali 2500 because they were ugly to me. Why in the world do car makers put HID headlights and then hologens fogs, I hate it. So I installed these LED fogs to color match my headlights and WOW they are bright! The light goes not only forward but up down and to the sides. I noticed everyone took pictures from outside which is great but to be different I figured I would take pictures from inside the cab. Without fogs and with fogs, sorry none with old hologens but they sucked anyways.

Installation was easy with good instructions and minimal skill. It took me about 20 minuets to install on my 2017 F-150 XLT. You will need a second person to lift the tailgate on and off. I love that it is completely hidden when installed compared to other similar products. It's installed behind the right tail light and replaces the factory latch. Tailgate lowers lightly when installed and saves you from accidentally dropping the gate and slamming it. The bracket comes painters black so if you have a different color vehicle you could paint it to match prior to installation but even if you don't it would still look better than other aftermarket products.

Excellent light bar performance and great value. You can't go wrong with this one. It's bright, solid and very inexpensive compared to the other makes. I installed this on my brush guard, but couldn't use the supplied mounts. I purchased a similar type mount but one that will swivel to allow for the bend in my brush guard bar. The supplied wiring harness is a good quality too. It even includes a inline fuse.

Quick review upon receiving this item (10/24/2017) - I haven't installed it yet (still testing), but will update the review when I do.This was purchased to replace the OEM non-drain plug pan equipped on a 2007 Dodge RAM 1500 2WD 4-DR (42RLE).The biggest complaint in all the reviews was that the plug leaked - so I wanted to address that immediately.So - Taking the "plug leak" into consideration, I filled the pan with fluid in the shop, placed it over a paper towel and bowl, and left it for 24+ hours.*No Leak* -  The supplied bolt was set at approximately 42 lb.ft torque (57 N.m) and did not have any indication of leaking.So initially, the concept that these pans leak is either due to incorrect fitment of the drain plug, incorrect tightening of the drain plug, or perhaps a quality control issue with previous pans.  I can only speak to that fact that the pan I purchased did not leak.  I would encourage anyone purchasing this product perform this test *prior* to installation to allow time to resolve any replacement necessary.Observations:-The pan appears to be of quality manufacture for a metal stamped part, and has consistent and adequate painting of it's surface.  There are no burrs, sharp edges or other obvious defects.-The pan with drain plug equipped was shipped in it's box (no outer box) and did not contain any other item (gasket, instructions, etc.)Recommendations:-Purchase the filter and gasket, and proper ATF to perform the correct service:<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ATP-B-216-Automatic-Transmission-Filter-Kit/dp/B000EQLCTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ATP B-216 Automatic Transmission Filter Kit</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Genuine-Chrysler-68218058AA-Automatic-Transmission-At-Oil/dp/B00PLX8FDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Genuine Chrysler (68218058AA) Automatic Transmission At Oil</a>

The hardware is kinda cheap, and the adjustments are endless. Once I get it to where I want, I will loc tight all nuts and bolts. Get a helper, or you will pull your hair out. Other than that, I just got it installed, and so far I like the look. Wind still hit's my face, but that's ok. I prefer the air, than a rock or a pebble off a tire. As I go forward from here, I may modify the mounts. I would definitely buy this product again for my Honda VLX 600 Shadow.I don't ride cross country, mostly short hops, so I can't comment on long trip status.

Fast shipping, Excellent product equal happy customer. I have pictures to show what they look like. If I was you I will make sure that it fit your car or truck. I just wanted to let people know that if you have a Nissan Altima 2007-2009 it fit. I'm thinking since the 2010-2012 have similar pin clips and push type retainer that it might fit but, don't take my word for it. On the other hand, I enjoy it since, it fit my Nissan with no problem. The reason why I  purchase this item because, the other ones were torn and, it was time to replace them. If you are thinking about getting rid of the old and, in with the new. Then this will be that product that will satisfy your need or want. Have a great day everyone and, I hope I was a help if not still have a great day.

This backing plate really steps up the performance of the original Meguiars Dual Action Polisher. The previous red backing plate was to small to generate heat and power to freely spin the pad. This new backing plate moves the pad even with some downward pressure to really work in the polish. Very pleased and great pricing.

High quality product, looks absolutely amazing on new Ducati Scrambler cafe racer. Make sure the wrap is tight and watch a video. Also watch a video on how to properly tighten the steel ties, mission critical that they are tight. Have many pairs of rubber gloves as the fiberglass weave is no joke on the skin. Overall a quality product and highly recommend.

Description is wrong.  The nozzle is 13/16" not 15/16" and the splash guard is made for a 1" nozzle so it doesn't stay on.

A great top rated tire at any price but a big plus that they are on the lower end of pricing for A-T truck tires.  They handle good, are quiet and look great, pictures do not do them justice. Tread is deep and aggressive although not as much as Mud tires that are not optimal for pavement driving.These tires also have the Winter Snow Flake rating for better winter snow handling and driving. I did a lot of research and these Falkens along with the Hankook DynaPro and Cooper AT3 are at the top of the ratings.  I went with these for the Extra aggressive sidewall look (and function) as well as the Snowflake rating. I hope they wear as good as my DynaPros did on my prior truck (5 yrs on Avalanche Z71) as I have only have had them for a couple weeks now on my 2016 GMC Sierra AT 1500 crew. Truck also has the 2" front RC level.

So far Im really impressed with the quality and especially with the price tag. I had issues with another set that caused my fog light housing to condensate. After that I was concerned about the seal for my next one. These one has a thicker seal than OEM! You can see the comparison for yourself in the pictures. After installing them I had a good feeling that they wouldnt condensate with the tight fit and the seal I made sure of. Cross my fingers but hopefully no condensation. This shoot a strong bright beam that matches my LED headlights and came it perfect. Installed to a 2015 Highlander.

Can't beat them for the price. The bad part is I've only had them for less than a month and after a handful of rides somehow both of my gloves ripped where the Velcro is. I guess they are cheaply made around that area they should be reinforced. Besides that though I really do like the gloves they feel good and they look tough. I probably wouldn't buy them again but because they are cheap I don't regret buying them. Even when they rip more I'll just keep wearing them without the Velcro. If they didn't rip it would have been 5 stars

This is a pretty cool first coat paint.  It has a translucent blue tint.  I decided to back it with Metallic Blue, but haven't had a chance to experiment with other backing colors.  The consistency when wet is a tad different from solid colors so drying time is a little longer.  I use a hair dryer to speed up the drying time.  Letting each light coat dry I think will have a better result.

Works great! We recently bought a travel trailer and I'll be darned if I was gonna stand there cranking away waiting to get it leveled! I quickly searched it out, found the Arksen at a great deal and hit order! It operates smooth, and quicker than me cranking it. The install was pretty easy, and I had it going in about 30 minutes.

Perfect addition to my '77 Jeep project! They're actually really nice. Time will tell how durable they are but for now they look great and fit the bucket seats I put in very well, though I may have to modify them a bit if I put in a 4 or 5 point harness. Very happy with these and highly recommend.

A surprisingly sturdy organizer for my car trunk. It's a good fit (see pic), a good capacity, and stays in place. Definitely a winner.I decided my new car deserved a better way to store the various emergency supplies and tools I keep in the trunk: gas can, jumper cables, inverter, tire pump, flare kit, small toolbox, etc. I also like to be able to easily remove the whole batch of stuff when I have to load larger cargo.This organizer is the perfect size for my Jetta current-generation (MK6, which covers 2011-2015). It's the right width that 3 organizers could fit side-by-side length-wise, with some extra space at the end. The height is just (barely) short enough to not block the trunk hinges, and so I can reach over to store items in the extra space behind the wheel-wells.The organizer is better quality than I expected for the sub-$12 price I paid. The sides are semi-rigid, and the bottom (soft) seems reasonably sturdy. The handles are securely attached. The material didn't seem to strain under the 10-12 lbs I loaded initially (when I carried it around, normally I just leave it in my trunk).There's are 4 velcro strips on the bottom which keep the organizer in place if you have a carpeted trunk liner-- it didn't budge at all during a 200 mile RT with some brisk turns. Unfolded and empty, the organizer stays mostly open/upright on its own. The side (mesh) pockets don't have a lot of give, so they are only suited for small or flat item (cables, screwdriver, etc).I looked at a number of other similarly priced organizers here-- most were also black nylon-like material, but many had bad reviews on the material, sturdiness, and design. I'm glad I went with this one. A nice, neat way to organize the things you carry in your vehicle, and be able to easily remove them when the space is needed for something else. Highly Recommended

So I was being stupid with my black Xterra and I managed to get some deep scratches on my fender when I was sanding down my lights so that I could polish and spray them with clear coat. End product: deep scratches on my passenger-side fender. Solution: Turtle Wax Color Magic + 2000 Grit Sandpaper + Water + Patience. If you have deep scratches, I recommend that you wet-sand the area and take your time so that you don't go down to the paint. I sanded until I could barely see the scratches, then I cleaned it carefully with some rubbing alcohol, applied some of this product and polished where I sanded. After that I took the chip stick, filled in the deeper scratches, and then I polished with the turtle wax 3 more times (and finally put a layer of carnauba wax on top). It worked beautifully! I can barely see the lines of the deeper scratches that reached the primer. So yes, you can use this to get rid of some deep scratches, it works wonderfully when you prepare the area by sanding, and I hope this review was helpful to anybody else that was in my situation.

Not what I ordered.  the description and picture shows vvivid xpo vinyl.  what I received was some chinese knock off.  the backing was not paper like vvivid's web site indicates as their authenticity stamp.  the backing was clear and the vinyl was brittle and would not stretch when heated.  I stayed off ebay because of the horror stories with knock offs but now amazon.  not happy with this at all.  amazon is going down hill. amazon even says the selling company is vvivid vinyl.  returning this cheap stuff.

I guess you get what you pay for...  Cover arrived yesterday and was installed today.  Installation took about 30 minutes because the bed extender had to be removed or moved so far forward that it was useless.  Keep this in mind if you have a bed extender.  I left mine installed but its so far forward that it might as not be there at all.  The cover itself is creased where it was folded in shipping.  I have no idea how long its been in the carton but it looks like a while.  Almost looks like the vinyl is beginning to crack so I give this thing 6 months tops before it will need to be replaced.  As far as fit goes, I've got a 2016 Nissan Frontier and it doesn't fit quite right even thought Amazon says it does.  On the tail gate there is a wide section at the top and on the next rain, the bed will not remain dry.  It just doesn't seal well there.  The clamps are made of plastic  and with the tension you have to put on them to get the cover to seal, I don't think their life expectancy will be long either.  The clamps for the rails for the bed extender are not quite the right size either.  You're going to either have to file/grind/cut the channels down so they actually fit, or tap them on with a rubber mallet.  But beware, I'm sure that probably voids the warranty somehow also - but check the page of stuff that constitutes voiding the warranty to make sure.  IMO, I guess this is OK for the price but only barely.  It's almost a temporary fix until I can find something better, but at almost $300, I'm going to have to keep it for awhile to make it worth it..... hopes it last that long.  I've enclosed some pictures and you can actually see where the stitching is coming loose already.  Just be aware.

High hopes smashed, I ordered the 8k bulbs after installing one side turned lights on to test no light I switched basest and I worked so bad ballest off the get go the light color is far from 8k it's more like 6k also the arc jumps causing "wiggle" the housing is solid and so it the bulb will be fine tell you hit a bump then it starts wiggling all over not pleased. Have a picture I have the 8k on the right and the kensun on the left you can see it's a big difference kensun is a 6k but looks to be only a 5k I'm annoyed spent too much money for products that a few years ago were the best now they are crap.

Just received this in the mail today and 3 hours later my pinstripes are gone!  This is the best $16 I have spent in a while.  With a little adjustment to my technique I was able to completely remove all of the adhesive.  I could have done the job faster, but there is a winter storm ere so I came in the house to warm up every once in a while. If I ever need to remove decals again I will be buying these.  All my friends will know about this product also.  Just in case anyone would like the information. It took 1 wheel to remove a 3/4" pinstripe on my whole 1988 Chevy c/k 1500 long bed.

I just swapped out my dated yellowish warm incandescent bulb in the dome light of my Scion FRS with this bulb. It's a perfect fit, way brighter, and a very modern WHITE light! I also like that the bulb still gradually dims on and off, as it did with the stock bulb. Also for the price, it's nice to get 4. Hopefully, as with most LED's that are known for longevity, these will not burn out prematurely. If it does I'll edit my review for sure. As of now, based on performance and price, it's a solid 5 star product, IMO.

This instructions are poor, even bad and misleading.  Minimal directions but if you jump into the install you'll figure it out.  The mfr installation video found online was not much help either.Biggest install issue:*  The body frame interferes with the disconnected swaybar up swing to reach the swaybar to the holding pins.The biggest issue I had for a brand new stock 2017 JKU Sahara was that the sway bar would not swing up to the holding pin becuase a tubular frame support extruded out the frame and interfered with it.  (See Picture).  I called Teraflex and they said they were aware of the issue and the solution was to grind away the tube extension until the swaybar had clearance to swing past it.  They said all jeeps were not made the same and they did not plan on modifying the kit but were planning on rewriting the instructions to mention this potential issue.  The car  dealer Jeep performance parts dude said they install these all the time with no problem.  Yea no problem is you consider grinding on the frame not a problem.Some installation tips...*  Check the swing clearance of the swaybar.  As all Jeeps are slightly different (per TeraFlex)  so you may need to get an angle grinder with a metal grinding disk and a face shield (Harbor Freight) if you don't have one.  When under the Jeep your face is right in it so you'll want a face shield.*  There is good access to the suspension when the Jeep is on the ground so you don't need to raise it to install the kit.*  It helps a lot if you turn the tires all the way left on one tire and then right on the other to get even more clearance.* You'll need 18mm socket with deep throat, 3/4" socket, ratchet and extensions, wrenches, a large flat blade screwdriver or prybar, a torque wrench with at least 18" handle (75 fl/lbs of torque is a lot so you need the leverage), some thread locker glue and possibly a angle grinder with metal disk (discussed earlier).*  Dont forget the grease nipples.  The grease nipples should be installed first or before the link is installed and also lubricated with a grease gun.  This is not mentioned anywhere in the instructions.*  Unlike the instructions both stock links should be removed before installing the replacements as it makes it easier.*  The 2 body mount bolts needs a 18mm long socket as the bolt extends well past the nut to be removed and a short socket will not reach it nor will a wrench because it surrounded by a cup.*  Some of the nuts provided are 3/4" so you need a socket or wrench of that size also.*  The 75 ft/lb required on the body mount nuts is a lot.  You'll need a torque wrench with a long handle and some socket extensions to be able to get to a point you have the clearance and leverage to pull hard enough.*  The brackets that pin the links  when you disconnect have to be held in place when you tighten the nuts as it swings out of place when tightening.  Use a lever (long flat blade screwdriver) to leverage it when tightening.*  Be aware of the orientation of the pins holes before tightening so you have the pins located for most convenient access when under the jeep.* Additionally the linkage is not adjustable in length.  While specified for a 0-2" lift, for a 0 lift jeep, the sway bar sits at about 30 degrees angle off horizontal.  The Jeep spec is that the sway bar should be +/- 5 degrees off horizonal.  That is why other manufactures of disconnects allow the linkage to be adjustable.Performance* On driver performance with the swaybar attached, I could feel no difference in body roll between the stock and the Teraflex.  With the swaybar detached a marked improvement in cab tilt when taking offroad.  When driving on paved with swaybar disconnected the Jeep drove like a old Buick swaying in the turns.  You have be very careful in the turns when its disconnected.*  Attached and removing is a b*****ch.  The bearing that slides over the pin  is so tight it requires a pry bar to remove and a large throated wrench to be able to squeeze it on the pin.  It fits fine on the holding pins just not the suspension pins.Conclusion:Having to grind the chassis on a 2017  to get the Teraflex to fit was a shock and was  not mentioned anywhere by Teraflex.  Any reasonable DIYer who is not afraid to get dirty can do this without the need to put it up on a lift.  However, know what I know now about the difficulty to attache and remove and the out of spec angle of the sway bar I would have purchased other adjustable disconnects  manufactured by JKS.

This gun is awesome.  If you want to foam up the car, you need to get a foam gun.  I purchased the green earth foam blaster and used it once, waste of money.  There is no comparison.  I used maybe 3 ounces of honeydew,  filled the bottle with hose water not even hot water as they suggest, and set the gun dial to 3/4 open.  The spray fan was also about half way.  I covered the car in foam in less than a minute and had not used even a third of the bottle.  I could not believe how much suds this thing produces.  The pics of the car are about a minute after I stopped spraying and the suds just seem to stick to the car.  I have a wally mart gas pressure washer 2700 psi subaru engine.  I had no trouble getting awesome foam out of this thing, not sure why others are not as stoked as I am.  Again don't waste your money on the green earth thing, I compared it directly side by side today with this and same soap and washer and was not even close,

This is the first time I've had both a summer and winter set of wheels/tires and have never given wheel totes a second thought. My auxiliary set gets stored in the back shed which is about 300 feet from my driveway. These toes have made lugging four 45lb wheels back and forth so much easier. My hands stay cleaner and I can carry two wheels at a time.I use these for my 225/40-18 setup and while I don't own an Audi, I will admit to paying a few extra bucks for this set because they're just cooler!I had a chance to use these for the first time recently and here are my quick thoughts:Pros-Super easy to take on and off-Adjustable to fit a wide range of wheel/tire sizes-Seem well made and durable-Nice clear slot under the handle to slide in a card indicating mounting location for next season-Audi logo adds extra coolnessCons:-A little more expensive than some of the more other choices but we all got these for the Audi logo, right?-Currently not sold through Prime so shipping may take longer for some

The HID Headlights by SDX are very nice high quality kit.  They are very easy to install and come with all the required hardware to do so.  I purchased these to install in my 1993 Turbo Nissan Altima with custom made projectors.They improve the light output on any car tremendously, so you can see things much better and further away.  I don't know how I was able to drive at night before installing these, I don't have a car now that does not have a HID kit installed.This item was shipped extremely fast and am very happy with my purchase.  I received this item at a promotional discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. I am not affiliated with this company and made no promises with the company of a good review for receiving the product.  My review is based on the product and my experience with the product.

I loved it at first but after about 1.5 months the gold paint has rubbed off in many places (see pictures) and the silicone on both sides of the flap that holds the chain is ripping.Maybe some versions of this have silicone colored all the way through but ones that are painted over uncolored silicone will not last.  Even unpainted versions are going to have issues with ripping silicone, though I have some hope that the rips will stop now that they've reached a thicker area.Overall, I'm probably going to have to throw away this $13 item in a few months when it starts to look too terrible, so I'm not happy.

Yeah..... It's bright. The Chinese knock offs are cheap, I'll give them that. There is NO comparison at all. Those things leak, they have s***** construction, the lens for flood to spot is a joke. This thing is lagit. No Chinese crap going on my jeep. Just watch where you mount the rubber sound deadeners. My windshield wipers hit one when I mounted it dead center. Moved it 6" and it's all good.

I'm going to start out negative because when I opened the package and found a paper telling me to rate the cover at  5 stars to help promote the product. I'm sorry thats not why I rate stuff. Ok lets get past that.  I love this cover and YES it fits a 2017 Silverado 1500 with a 6.5 bed. On the Amazon page it states it does not.  Its easy to install 20min without help and it seems to be made well. I was surprised after 2 inches of rain and a 60mph thunderstorm yesterday it was bone dry inside. I have not drove though heavy rain yet but I've had no leaks on wet roads so far.  It fits well on the sides and at the back corners. I've seen some that just don't fit the weird curved lines of this new Chevy bed. Only minimal flap noted at highway speeds. The clamps go on easy and hold well. It comes with foam tape that seals the slight difference at the front of the bed and the bed rails. The only problem cosmetically is wrinkle areas at the folds of the cover. I hoped with time they would disappear but looking at other folding covers I think it is the nature of the beast. The storage bag is cheap made but useable.  The light that comes with this is a joke but thats not worth effecting the rating. Bottom line this is the best cover I have seen for even twice the money.

Great until they died. I bought a set for my 2010 Mitsubishi Outlander. While they worked at first, both had issues with the front LEDs going out, as well as a couple rows of LEDs going out on the sides. They were bright until they died. A couple users from a Mitsubishi forum reported the same results as well. Would not buy again.

I like the level a lot.  The small bubble and graduated marks help take the guesswork out of how much I need to raise or lower the jacks or how many inches I need to add under the tires to get the trailer level.My problem is with the crappy tape on the back of the level.  The level comes with a strip of foam tape on the back of the level.  The problem is the foam tape is too thick, causing the level to stand off from the camper about 1/16", or just enough to allow the level to twist it's positioning and move it off of center.  This gives a false reading of about 2 - 3 inches out of level.I corrected the issue on the levels I purchased by stripping off the factory tape and applying a thinner double-sided outdoor tape.  Now my levels work as expected.  If I had not had to make the modifications myself I would have given this product 5 stars.There are two pre-drilled holes that I suspect are to screw the level to the camper if you want, but I didn't want to drill holes in the side of my camper.

This is a really cost efficient way to use a great product---classic Made in USA WD-40. Works great for everything I've ever needed it to do between unfreezing rusted hinges and protecting tools from rust. I hear that it gets a lot of hate from some folks, but I really don't see why---it's great for me!

I began using Castrol GTX 5W30 since 1991 when I bought a new Bonneville. I run the car 325,000 miles in 21 years and never had any motor issues. I used the oil for another 109,000 miles on a 2005 Park Avenue before it was totaled in 2011. My current 2008 Buick has 104,000 miles on Castrol motor oil. This car has an oil change monitor so I go about 4,000 miles between changes.The easy pour bottle prevents the oil from spurting out.I will keep on using this oil.Update: March 2017- - - - - - - - - - - - -  No complaints with the oil but the 5 quart bottle has been resigned. I wasn't aware of this as my last oil purchase in June 2016, I bought five 5 quart jugs and it carried me through the rest of the year. I  have tagged on three photo's of the new bottle. The new bottle is cumbersome to carry. There is only one carry handle on it in the upper right corner. The bottle tend to pitch forward when you carry it. My hand and arm were sore walking through the store up to the cash register. The Cap has been redesigned and harder to remove prior to the lock ring breaking away. The vertical ribs spacing on the cap are a 1/2" apart and they are somewhat sharp. I ended up having to use a rubber jar lid gripper to break the cap loose. The pouring opening is  now 1-9/16th diameter versus the previous bottles 1- 1/4" opening. The new bottle is 12 -1/2" tall vs 11- 15/15th on the old bottle. The new bottle will not fit on the shelf  in my metal cabinet that I have been storing gallon jugs on for the past 18 year.

Used it this weekend and it worked like a champ. Trailer weight is 3000 and has 14 inch wheels.  Slipped into place with a very minimum of fuss and using the supplied ratchet lifted the side up roughly 3 inches, dropped the stabilizers and the trailer was as good as it could be. Very happy with purchase.

NOT HAPPY !!! MADE IN KOREA! Also the Pressure Relief Valve is now on the top under the leaf spring, so during high pressure the oil will flow over the dirty media and back into the engine.EDIT: If anyone here on Amazon has USA MADE STOCK, PLEASE POST A REPLY and I will choose your store here on Amazon to make my purchases, Thank you

" After searching the internet and the typical motorcycle parts websites thouroughly  I was about ready to give in on a much more expensive seat where I would have had to ( make it work) for my 2005 Suzuki Boulevard. I ordered the armrest and spacer kit as I thought I needed that due to the back pad. Delmer contacted me an hour later and said no need that will fit right in there with my existing 4 screws. I received my package two days later at a significantly better value than all other moto sites. Like Delmer said fit right in there. Five minutes later I had a very nice armrest setup on the bike. More riding outings for me because the back passenger will be even happier. Nothing but praise for this operation. Continued success and I will spread the word. "

I have only used these to make a couple flashlight/worklights. for the great price,they are handy & worth the money spent. ran one set of wires through a piece of loc-line flexible tubing to make a 12 volt work light for workbench-grinding/soldering/drill press etc... put one under the seat on a motorcycle & used a 2 pin flat (sae) connector common to many battery chargers.

I would have given this 5 stars except for the deficiency of the manual, that does not repeat the electrical schematic on the front panel.  So I take off the front panel to install it, and never see that schematic.  I do look through the manual and found nothing.  So I just had to experiment with what was what (the connections for "battery" and "slide out" are confusing on the fuse panel).  In fact, even the cover schematic is not as good as the one I have added from a third source.But I do particularly like the led light that comes on when a particular fuse is blown.  Wow... wish my car and house had this!

Had these on my WJ for 6 months, just removed them to install a real lift. They worked well on and off road and have no indication of wear of malfunction. Extremely easy to install and retained factory ride. They are a tad expensive compared to other similar budget lifts.

This is a great top. Install is simple, it requires not header, and comes with everything you need. I've also found the roll bar bungies to make a great sunglasses holder.There are some cons. As there is no header and the top secured to the footman loops it does sit low. I'm 6' and have some headroom, but if you are over 6' 2" you might find the headroom a little cramped.Also there are two grommets in the middle of the sound bar that tap against it at speeds over 30 mph. They are surrounded by Velcro, so that's an easy enough fix.All in all great sun shade. It helps reduce wind noise, and has no issues with billowing.

If you work or spend any time in your car with a laptop or fast food, you have to get this. It's study, cheap, no moving parts, locks onto and comes off of any steering wheel with ease. It will last forever. And, it fits in my laptop bag. Perfect size, lightweight. See photos for better size and to see how it fits on my 2000 Dodge Caravan. It can double as a "tray" when I'm camping too. I like that I can put it on even grungy picnic tables and know my food is clean. So many potential ways to use it outside the van I may need to buy another one!

My first DA polisher. The kit is awesome, polisher is great with plenty of power. I bought this along with a bottle of VSS and Butter Wet Wax for my 06 H2. 12 years of not taking care of the paint left it full of scratches. VSS cleaned it up a bit but didn't have enough cut for full removal. I gave in and tried all 4 from the sample pack, starting with V32 all the way to V38 then followed by the Butter Wet Wax. The scratches are gone completely, the paint looks like glass, the metallic shines brilliantly, and it has so much depth do it! I couldn't be happier!The first picture you can see how badly scratches the paint is in the reflection and the second picture is after the 4 step and wax.

I like that it looks cool and it's has a nice heavy feel. Not sure yet how well the reception is, I just put it on. The issue I have is, that it has (SMALL CHIPS ALL IN THE FINISH). I installed it, I guess I can repaint it, but for the price, it shouldn't have chips all on it!((UPDATE... I have received my replacement. It too has a few very small chips, but is much better than the first one.)) Reception is less than desirable, but I use my Ipod so it's not an issue for me. 3 from 2 stars.

As expected, it took a bit of manipulating to get the tool properly positioned inside the coil spring. I positioned it as close to the top and bottom of the spring as possible, ie until the spacing between the coils was too close to get the tool any further. I also had to use three large nuts as spacers so the the center shaft (screw) would not hit the upper control arm when compressing the spring (See Picture). Once positioned, it was easy to compress the spring and remove it from the control arms. I will be using it to reinstall the coil springs.

I've read mixed reviews on this hitch. That said, I took a chance with this item. Instructions were very good with illustrations. If you are confused by all the holes in the upper plate, this kit uses 2 U-bolts that wrap around the axle (this takes up four of the holes) along with 2 longer hex head bolts with bushings that go where the OEM hitch bolts were located. Looks and performs as a 2" hitch should. When torqued down this hitch is as solid as the factory hitch, probably stronger too.

Very satisfied. Typically, buying at such a low price point,  there will be a couple that don't work. I've used 6 so far, and they're all been perfect (I will update as I install more{used 2 more, both worked}.) These give a much cleaner look to an interior than standard bulbs, and at $.65 per, the price is definitely right.

I like to use brake cleaner as a parts cleaner, because its oil free.I have a BMW 335i and it regularly needs service, which I generally perform. This particular engine, the N54 is famous for the half engine check light. This is a Vanos code (usually). It can come from a few different issues, dirty oil, gunked up Vanos valves (there are two), or a bad Vanos valve. The parts are easy to access, so I clean them about every 3000 Miles. Thats basically during oil changes, and at mid point between changes.These twin turbo, direct injected engines get gunked up pretty quickly, and the dealer charges $700 to change them. So this spray brake cleaner is cheap maintenance.I love that it has a spray straw like the old WD40 cans. So you can get down inside the valve and clean it from the inside out.This cleaner does a great job on this service. It does a great job cleaning brakes too!!

When I set out looking for a winch, I didn't need a heavy duty winch, only one that was A.) wireless capable and B.) would tow around 2-3k pounds.  My application was far from going on an ATV.  Heck, I don't even own an ATV.  My application was a mechanism that would allow me to PULL my 16' bass boat into my garage.  The reason for this is because I have literally half an inch of clearance on either side of the garage, and a small incline going into the garage, so imagine trying to back it in perfectly with a manual transmission.  It took quite a few tries, and the result was it made it in, with a side of burnt clutch lol.  So, as an engineer, I knew there had to be a better way.  So, I took this winch, bolted it directly into the concrete garage floor at the rear, connected it to an old 12V battery (that remains constantly connected to the A/C outlet with a compact battery tender) and using the wireless remote & cable hookup I fabricated, connect to the rear of the boat and pull it in slowly while I stand at the bow and steer using the trailer wheel.  This way, I can shift it hard right or left to get the angle exactly right.  PERFECT setup, and this winch, so far, has proven to be exactly what I expected.The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the wireless remote control quality is piss poor.  The power switch feels like it could break at any point, and the overall weight is extremely light, meaning it isn't built very rigidly, etc..  But, it does work, unlike some other posts i've read.  It worked right out of the box.

Excellent lock pin for 2 inch hitch receiver. Set it up in 5 minutes and would never need to worry about keys. Put some WD-40 in the lock for additional rust protection. Lock spin wheels work smooth and are easy to operate even in gloves.I would recommend this to anyone in need of simple hitch protection.

Solved my '97 5.7L Silverado sluggish starts. It's smaller/lighter than the old Delco but, engages fast and strong. The '97 Chevy's starter is positioned above/behind two ridged lines (see photo) making it a little difficult to drop out.  However, the TYC's size made it easier to work back into place.  Bolt alignment was perfect, no shims and a solid fit. For the price and DIY labor, it's a good deal.  We'll see how it lasts!

The first ride with them installed it ended up raining on us, but the 3m adhesive held strong (cleaned the spot before installing). The lights are BRIGHT! Brighter than I expected. Plenty bright to be seen in daylight, plenty bright to be seen from the saddle. ;) I have no load resistors or flasher relay upgrades installed (back lights are still stock, for now). The cords are super-long, too, so you could probably mount them anywhere on any bike and still be able to reach. They have no connectors on the ends, but they were easy to strip & wrap around the existing blinker cables' connection. The way they were packaged was kind of wonky, as they were folded to fit into an envelope that was not as long as it should've been; the clear plastic covering of one of the lights was split/cracked at this fold, but the light still functions and even in the rain it didn't short out. The only pics I currently have are of testing them pre-mount. I'll update with pics of them mounted.

This to me is a great temporary solution to mount a gauge. It looks good, and feels sturdy. It comes with a round double sided piece of tape. Make sure the surface is super clean before you try to stick it on. Has a small hole at the bottom end of the pod for the wires or hose. Can be swiveled up or down. Like I said, I'm only using this until I find a gauge pod made specific for my vehicle that I like. For the price and use, it gets 5 stars easy.

I really like these covers! They are thick vinyl with a soft inner liner. They wrap around the wheel/tire and buckle in the lower back. The vinyl itself is a heavy, thick material and the stitching seems like it will be tough. I ordered the 24-26 inch item and my wheels/tires measured 24 inches from tread to tread. They were simple to install as long as you are ok getting on the ground and getting under the vehicle a little bit. The buckle in the back is plastic so hopefully it holds up. Time will tell on that. I do wish Camco offered them in grey so they would match the rv cover but that is no big deal. I am very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend this cover to a friend.

I have been using this stuff for close to 5 years now. Maybe longer. I go with this over the other options because it stays wet looking, doesnt sling all over my truck when I drive after applying and lasts for weeks. The initial wet shine lasts roughly a week. The dark black tone stays on the tires for about a month depending on your driving conditions.In the past I have used Tire Wet by Black Magic, Black Magic's Tire Gel, Eagle 1 Tire Wet, and I recently tried Meguiars new Ultimate Black Tire Spray. This stuff bests all those, and so I just bought two more bottles. Nothing has done as good a job and looks as nice for as long as the Tire Gel here.For application, a little goes a long way, you can start heavy to do the first wheel, spread evenly and reapply to your applicator for each additional wheel. If you use a tire gel or spray sponge you need less each wheel because it builds up in the sponge. I have used the Eagle 1 and Carrand sponges for years. They are both good, though I prefer the Carrand Tire Applicator because it has a handle and wide curve surface to coat the entire tire in 1 or 2 passes. Less work on the shoulders after doing all 4 tires.I wash my vehicles every week, sometimes 2 times depending on the time of year. I live in Va Beach, so when they threaten snow in the winter, all sort of chemicals go down on the roads. So washing my vehicle repeatedly each week, this product doesn't wear off quickly.Smells nice too, not that it matters. I think its a grape smell, but not 100% sure.I use it now on my '12 Sierra Denali, and before on my '09 Silverado Crew Cab and '02 Dodge Intrepid R/T. Tires always look nice and the shine lasts. Just ordered 2 more bottles.I definitely recommend this stuff. Like I said, goes on smooth, smells, nice and your paint won't wear it down the side when you are driving. I reapply about every 2 weeks, after a few washes to keep the wheels nice and black.

GREAT US made tire cover ... Be sure your cover is authentic. It took me a few to get the authentic version. US made products do not ship from over seas.. if it costs half the price as the authentic it should be obvious you will receive an inferior product that will not last one summer and the print is horrible. If you receive the small cover from China return it. The real version weighs aprox 2 pounds .. the China cover weighs less than 1 pound. The Honda print on the China cover is a pale white and the logo is huge looking terrible. The US made cover has nice crisp accurate image printed in metallic silver ink just like the OEM version ...

I had really high hopes for this product as I was respraying my dump bed. When I first started spraying it, I was so excited to see it go on so nice as I didn't want the bedliner look. About 20min into spraying, disaster hit. I was spraying with a pump sprayer and it lost prime. I went over to the paint can and found it had turned to sludge. Temperature was mid 60s with very low humidity. In the end, my pump, gun and hose were ruined as was the remaining 3/4 of a gallin plus of paint. It basically turned to tar. I read the instructions on the can and it mentioned nothing of anything to do with this extremely fast setting up time. Only after diving deep into the online forums did I find any of this info. The product would get 5 stars from me for what was sprayed before it all went to sh*t. But the fact that nothing is mentioned on the can of the dangers of minimal exposure to air is ridiculous to me.So-What I found online AFTER all of this is...-Even though it says you can spray with an airless sprayer, don't unless you can somehow isolate the can from air-Dump out just the amount you need and cover the rest. Be very careful NO PRODUCT is on the rim of the can or it will weld the top on-Roll or brush the product. Spraying with a standard air sprayer may work but I have read of many people ruining their guns if they spray for any length of time.-AND NUMBER ONE, do as much research as you can online before applying this product. Search for exactly how you want to apply it and on what as the product is very picky of what it wants to stick to and how to keep the remaining amount.

Couldn't find a picture of the wheel to wheel ones on a 2017 crew cab with 6'6" bed so was a little nervous but they turned out good. 4 stars cause I wish they were 6" longer and the square head bolts that slide in the boards are aluminum not steel. I decided to buy and install steel square head bolts, cost me another $30. I feel like the rear doors could use an additional hanger/support as well but since we don't have passengers a lot it'll be fine. Bought the wheel to wheel ones for easier access to the bed without scratching the truck. Overall, I'm happy for the price and they look nice!

Fits well on my 2016 Jeep JKU. Lays flat across the roof and has enough room to go around the stock antenna with it bent back towards the windshield. Elastic banding keeps in bunched around the front and back bumper. Just perfect for keeping the dirt and dust off during the week. For $39 it really is a good deal, I would have paid more!

It won't, the fabric stitched on the inside of the pvc liner square is smaller and is warping the whole product....

Best if you first, wash vehicle, clay and perform paint correction if needed prior to application for optimum results.Prior to applying, wash vehicle with Dawn and dry, clay if needed... while vehicle is wet rub fingers gently across paint surface ( best if insert fingers in a baggie, plastic bag or cigarette cellophane) if you feel grit, claying is needed... next do a IPA wipedown to promote best adhesion for longer protective results. If you don't know what an IPA wipedown is --- Google it / Youtube ----I use a microfiber pad to apply and wipe off BFWD with a plush microfiber towel. It can be applied by a finishing pad if using a buffer.The majority of BFWD curing takes place immediately upon removal of the product, once introduced to the air. In the past, I have applied BFWD only to have it rain just as I was finishing application, w/o any short or long term issues. Once the BFWD starts to lose its shine, it can be revived by wiping the vehicle down with your favorite detail spray..I prefer Aquapel tor treating my windshield but occasionally will use BFWD when my Aquapel stock is depleted. In conclusion, I gave BFWD a 5 star rating due to its multi purpose uses, cheap price and ease of use. If you want a longer lasting sealant, dig deeper in your pockets as there are a bunch of good products available with today's advanced technology...Always wash vehicle with an automotive soap instead of Dawn. Dawn will strip newly applied wax from a vehicles leaving the paint unprotected//Attached a few pics after applying BFWD to my 08 Ram

I've been waiting for this to arrive as I'm going to be hauling a trailer about 600 miles soon and wanted a good level connection. This hitch is solid! It cost a little more than some other adjustable hitches, but it's MADE IN THE USA (Idaho to be exact).I was a little hesitant at first getting the 8" drop version as it looked long. However, I have a stock 3/4-ton GMC 4x4 and it rides higher than my old half-ton 2wd, which I would normally have to raise up my hitch an inch or so for it. Anyhow, after measuring I figured I would probably have to use the bottom hole on the 4" drop model, which would still have the reverse ball sticking lower, so might as well get the 8" and I could always cut off a little from the bottom if need-be. I measured I think like 20-1/2" from the ground to the top of the 2" ball using the middle pin hole.First, since dimensions are so hard to find for this, the hitch part with all the holes is exactly 12" long, end to end. Measured from the top of the hitch bar to the bottom is 11-1/8", so you can hopefully measure your vehicle and see how it will ride. As for my truck after installing I measured somewhere between 11"-12" of ground clearance, more than adequate for your average hauls. I figure for anything super heavy I'll probably end up flipping the hitch over if I need clearance or get a dedicated 2-1/2" hitch anyways. But this is great for all the usual small trailers and boats I usually pull.Even flipped over the tailgate can still be lowered and clear just fine.Everything has good tolerances, nothing is too tight where it would bind, yet not too loose where it will rattle like crazy.UPDATE - Made my 600 mile journey hauling a trailer with 5,000lbs or more, plus another 1,000lbs in the bed of my truck. Once loaded down I had to use the center-line point, so I flipped the hitch over for more clearance. No issues at all. Like I said before everything is a good fit so I didn't even hear any clanking like you can sometimes hear from hitches with poor tolerances.

These are absolutely gorgeous. The only issue I had with them was the fact that they are pretty big so my license plate frame had to be removed since the slot wasn't big enough to fit them on: Im sure it depends on what frame you have. Mine had 3D work above the slots so it was raised up. If you're is pretty flat where it screws in I think it will be fine(1) easy to install(2) look great(3) excellent customer serviceLook great on my silver Camry

I installed it on a 2014 C7 Corvette--it takes quite a bit of time to do it neatly.  I put the sensor in the grille.  Although all of the instructions state a 20" sensing distance I'm getting less.  If you're installing it on a C7 or most anything else be sure to check out this video: http://www.corvetteforum.com/forums/c7-general-discussion/3376460-best-location-to-install-the-c7-curb-alert-bumper-protection-system.html  Installing it on a C7 where the video suggests is likely a VERY BAD idea--the lens will become dirty rendering it useless--further, it's at risk of damage.  When installing on a C7 be sure to NOT hold the brackets up to check (it comes with four) as there's a good chance you'll drop the bracket in back of the grille and fishing it out could be very difficult; first attach the bracket to the sensor then check for fit--it's too large with the sensor attached to fall behind the grille.  Also be careful where you mount it so that you can get the Allen (hex) wrench in to adjust the unit.  If you're installing it on a C7 as shown in the video you'll likely have to loosen the trim on the right side of the windshield using a star wrench--I've attached a picture.  After you loosen the screw, pull the black trim piece back about a quarter inch or so from the glass so you can slide the micro USB connector through--be sure to have the USB connector laying with the broad flat side down.

Great sturdy wheel mount. Please note that when you add this, your wheel bumpers on the tailgate and lower panel will no longer touch your tire, especially if you have oversized (I have 31's) tires. Easy answer but takes a little elbow grease is use hockey pucks to fill the gap. Just cut the puck to shape of original bumpers, smooth with a grinder or sander, drill a center hole and add slightly longer (1 inch longer) bolts and you are done for cheap! I paid a total of 8 bucks for a pack of 6 hockey pucks here on amazon. extends the bumpers out just over 1 inch which fixes the problem. Took me about 1 hour to do all 5.

Nice helmet! Does have road noise, but I can reposition my body to reduce that noise - so it is probably in a buffering zone.I have owned Arai, Shoei, Icon and HJC helmets.I rate this LS2 above Icon and HJC, and not far behind the Arai and Shoei.EDIT: Dropping to 3-Stars. Purchased 28 May 2018, and today is 6 July 2018. After a month of light use, one of the clips holding the visor on fell off. In the attached picture, I show one of these clips, but the one that fell off did so while I was riding - so, it is MIA (gone forever) leaving one side of my face shield to flop around. I am attempting to contact the company today about a replacement. If LS2 can get me a replacement part, I will come back to let everyone know and update the Star Rating.

One big complaint is the dent in the corner of the case! The tools are great, no problems there. the dent is the failure on the manufacture not the seller or the great condition in how it was delivered! the cardboard box had zero dings or bents.love the gear quality tool and it didn't fail putting in the new bearings. Should have made in the U.S.A.

Good quality mirror, but the interior control ferrule was incorrect for the car and did not fit my 2000 Focus. The car requires a slot-and-tab ferrule, but this mirror has a threaded ferrule that is too large for the hole.  Photo show the one from my car.Seller did not respond to questions about this issue, so I reamed out the hole and installed the control lever trim with glue. Not an ideal situation.

Truxedo makes a great product, and this one is no exception.  It is my third Truxedo bed cover and the first that I've installed myself.  It looks good, fits well, and with the accessory weather stripping kit, should be water and dust free.  Installation - as almost always - is somewhat more involved than portrayed by any of the on-line videos on the subject, and you do need at least one additional tool that indicated on the printed instructions.  To wit, removing and reinstalling the bar at the front end of the bed - so that foam seals can be applied to both ends - requires a T30 torque driver bit, although this step could be skipped without grave consequences.  A ruler and a rubber mallet (for tapping things into place, etc.) are also helpful.  I am attaching a photo of the in-progress installation and the completed project on my 2017 Tacoma.

So these are ok headers, but the seller is including a stud "kit". The stud kit is cheap crap, and not sized correct to application. This is FRAUD, as it is intended to imply there is greater value than is actually being provided. If  you got this kit and also received the incorrectly sized hardware I recommend reporting to FTC as I am if not resolved through Amazon. The seller is a scammer and assumes he can get away with this.So the kit in question includes very cheap studs and nuts. The studs are a bit coarser than the application calls for (5.2L/ 5.9L magnum heads). The studs should be 5/16 - 18 , but are probably a 5/16 - 16. It's close enough to force them as they are very soft, but leads to striping/hard to torque down properly. Additionally the cheap nuts are large with a wide flange. They add to the interference of the already slightly difficult to fit headers. I literally needed to start the and tighten them down little by little as the would bind against the primaries otherwise.The attached pic shows one of the studs aligned with one of the stock bolts. If you look close you can see that they are different thread counts.In the end I pulled them ground reliefs for the plug wires (the boots literally touch the flange otherwise). replaced the gaskets since being unable to torque them properly they had blown out, and installed with a set of small head header bolts. Only giving two stars as the headers themselves seem relatively heavily built.If you are looking at this listing, don't there are plenty of others. If you made the mistake I did and need to reinstall, just pick up a fresh gasket set and a good set of header bolts, or properly sized studs.

I installed these last night.  So far they are great.  No threadlock was included so I had to buy my own.  They fit great on my 2007 JKU. Install was straight forward.  Did it with a jack, breaker bar, threadlocker(red, maximum strength), 19MM socket(wheel lugs), 3/4" socket(spacer lugs) and electric impact.  My lug nuts are 19MM but the lugs for the spacers are 3/4" so that would be helpful to know off the bat as I tried to get my 19MM deep socket in and it did not fit inside the hole but the 3/4" fit(pretty tight but still worked).  I would not say that this helped my handling a ton but I do feel more stable.  Still a little loose in the steering like it always has. But it does feel more stable. I got these for a more aggressive look and I am going to a larger tire(33s to 35s) soon and will need the extra room.

I was very pleased with results on a bag I purchased on Etsy. The leather was dry and stiff. After it was much softer and richer looking. I didn't see a dramatic change in color. The photo shows on the left after the bag had dried for 48 hours. No noticeable smell. I will probably put on another coat after another week. I feel i used a liberal amount, my bag absorbed a lot of oil.

I would give this negative stars if possible! Don't waste your time, energy (or more importantly) your money on this peice of garbage. It's made out of tissue paper thin material, and fell apart in under 1 year of use. I am super critical in protecting all of the sharp edges in my TT, so it wouldn't rip, but made zero difference. A 10 MPH wind associated with a bit of rain, totally destroyed this thing. Would never buy again or recommend to anyone

It looks nice on the truck but, i received a damaged goods passenger side front on the corner. It is too late when I saw it. I already attached on the door when I saw the damaged or cracked area. I should have a replacement for that or should I say, i need a replacement. 02-22-18, I received the replacement (in perfect condition) as what the seller promised. I am impressed and very happy about it. Kudos to this seller. I bought lots of accessories to this  seller and they never let me down. Thank you.

Broke on first use. FIRST USE! Not my first time with winches either. Looks like winch cable snagged the skid plate on the bottom of the winch. I was stuck on the side of a hill so I carefully rolled out line and backed down the hill: only got worse. Metal shavings, metal plates all over the place. Got down the hill, made my way around, and tugged for half an hour to get things unstock. Glad it was within my replacement period.

FINAL REVIEW:Though I wrote this review many times, I will give it this final review. This muffler fit in my 2007 F150 CrewCab no problem, the main issue is that the mechanic and I should have just trimmed off a section to make the pipes go in flush. Despite what other people here and the manufacturer may say, YOU MAY HAVE TO TRIM TO MAKE IT FIT, but it straight from the factory works on you then this does not apply to you. This thing sounds great and once your used to the new rummbling you won't notice this thing at all.

MoS2 Anti-Friction Engine Treatment:- This our classic anti- friction additive. The MoS2 Anti-Friction Engine Treatment works exclusively with the solid lubricant MoS2.The MoS2 forms a high.load lubricating film on all rubbing and sliding surface and this reduce the friction in the engine.Since this additive works only with a solid lubricant, you need to add it at every oil change to get a optimal wear protection.The MoS2 is well-suited for cars which were built before the year 2000 and for classic cars.MotorProtect:- This additive works exclusively with a chemical friction modifier and without any solid lubricant.The friction modifier and the surface active components modifiying the sliding and rubbing surface under pressure and heat.Therefore it reduce the mechanical wear and also the friction.The modified surface has a long therm effect of 50.000 km (31.250 miles) even if you change the oil.So you need this additive not at every oil change.Doe to the long therm effect is this additive well-suited for new cars to protect them before wera from the beginning.Cera Tec:- The Cera Tec is the newest anti-friction additive in our assortment.This additive is a combination of a chemical friction modifier and a ceramic solid lubricantBy this combination the Cera Tec prevents the direct metal-to-metal contact and reduce so the friction and the wear.It is like you use MotorProtect and the MoS2 at the same time, with the different that the friction modifierfrom the Cera Tec is not so strang as the friction modifier from the MotorProtect but the ceramic solid lubricant in the Cera Tecis more robust then the MoS2 and therefore more effective.The friction modifier has like the MotorProtect a log therm effect but when you drain the oil you lost the solid lubricant like the MoS2.Since the friction modifier is not so strong, it is recommendable to use the Cera Tec at every oil change to get the best effect.We recommend the Cera Tec for all cars which are built as of the year 2000 but you can use it also for older cars from the 90`s.For classical cars is the Cera Tec not really suited.

I just bought this kit for my '98 TJ with the 4.0L engine to replace a messed up exhaust system that's been bugging me for years.  Initial impressions are good and I'm pleased with the apparent quality of this affordable part.  The entire kit appears to be stainless steel with a large 2-1/2" pipe running from the coupler into the connverter and the standard 2-1/4" outlet from the converter which will mate up with aftermarket mufflers such as the Banks Monster muffler.  The coupler flange isn't a fixed rolled flange as shown in the rendered image.  It's a 3/8" slip flange which isn't an issue and may even be a plus but bolts aren't included.  The other thing I noticed is that the inlet and outlet tubes on the converter aren't inline. It looks like the outlet is canted 5 degrees inward but that's just an estimate.  I'm not sure if this is by design or by accident but will know this weekend.I've had my Jeep for 16 years and about 12 years ago installed a Banks header and Banks muffler keeping the factory downpipe and catalytic converter.  The problem I had was the union between the Banks header and Jeep downpipe.  It never sealed well so I had an exhaust shop cut out the union and splice in a piece of tubing.  Needless to say it didn't go well and the leak has been there for years.  Since I'm in the process of replacing the badly corroded original oil pan that has served me well, I need to remove the factory downpipe and figured that this is the perfect time to replace it along with the rear main seal, a new Banks header & Banks exhaust.  I'll update this review or make another review once I've completed the installation.  So far so good though.

I ordered these due to the tall height and wide base for extra stability.The top of the bar is as shown (slight v-style as opposed to curved style)They do include the pads on the  base (not shown in the photo for some reason).They seem very stable even when raised.Only a slight rock when on a flat floor.15 3/4" - 24" Low / Raised height (measured at low point of the "v" in the bar.The base of the V will sit at 15" if the bar is all the way down (ratchet not engaged in any pawl)Base: 10 3/8" - 11 1/2" (measured to outside of the pads)Ratchet bar ~1 3/16" thick. 4 1/8" wide (outermost) or ~3 3/8" wide (inside of the "ears")The V sits about 1/2" deep (from top of ears, not including the groove) and the groove is about 1/4" deep.I may not use them often due to large size but it's good to have when I need them.See photos in Customer photo gallery.

I hit the trails a lot with my JK and this is cheap insurance when I go over large boulders. I also have the oil pan skid, transfer case skid and evap canister skid. (Don't have the gas tank skid....yet) installation was a bit difficult. You'll have to pull the exhaust down enough to be able to slide the skid into place. The directions are vague too but anyone that knows a bit about working on vehicles can figure it out.

I had to write a review and share pictures as when I was researching and still thinking of buying this bumper protector, I couldn't find a decent picture of the product installed anywhere. Just close up pics of he product with the hatch open. Doesn't help much if you want to see how it looks if the hatch is closed! First off, It was pretty easy to install. About 20 minutes as I had to make sure that the bumper was completely dry. It is important that the bumper is clean. I washed it off with soap, rinse and dry. Once completely dried, wiped it off with a rag soaked in alcohol. I was never a fan of exterior auto parts installed with double adhesive tape no matter if it's 3M as it will definitely ruin the paint job or in time, fall off. However, there is no other bumper protector option for the XB aside from the vinyl sticker which I think is just for looks. The instructions were pretty straight forward. When pulling off the red tape, make sure that the product is aligned to the bumper by giving it a little push and avoid pulling the center tape before the first tape as it will stick and would be a pain to remove. Experienced it first hand! Once the red tape is completely off, I put pressure on it by hand and thumb, for the adhesive to sit properly. Manual stated that the tape will fully stick in 24 hours.The verdict: Although the actual product doesn't completely cover the edge of the bumper as pictured, I'm happy with my purchase. The product looks well made and the tape is pretty strong. Tried to pull it out but the thing didn't budge which is a good sign. Only concern is that water will definitely seep in and I truly hope that the tape holds for at least, the whole time I will have this car. The manufacturer offers a limited lifetime warranty for defects. Just send a picture and proof of purchase. Bushwacker customer service responded 2 hours after I sent them an email which is impressive and rare nowadays. So, if you are considering in purchasing this product, just go for it. Just make sure that you install it as instructed by the manufacturer and it should be a breeze.**I'd like to add... After looking at the pictures, I noticed that I might have rushed the installation a bit. The bumper protector is a liittle more on the driver side! LoL! Measured it and found that it's off by about 1/4 of an inch although I just followed the instructions to properly center it. Grrrr!Another tip: Take your time and make sure to measure that the sides are even and the product centered before installing :)

I purchased after finding it as an alternative to one found in a local store with identical specs. Works great as extra back up lights. My only dislike is I had to drill holes out 3/8 inch because the provided hardware makes for a sloppy and unpredictable assembly. I would gladly purchase again and recommend.

This thing has a nice harness, with an additional Powerlet socket. The reason I paid as much as I did for this though, was the 12v socket and the USB. After less than 1 season on the bike, nothing was working. I took it apart and saw both solder joints on the choke were fractured and the 12V wire was broken off of the socket.After rewiring and making sure there were no more cold solder joints, it now works, hopefully it will get me through the next month.

Hotbodies Racing makes great aftermarket parts! These blue-smoke flush-mounted turn signals gave my 07 GSXR600 a clean, sharp look. The blink bright and fast - very visible. WAY BETTER then the stock turn signals mounted to the back of goofy giant mirrors (I picked up a bar end mirror). I had my mechanic swap the plug&play connectors from the stock turn signals, to the ends of the Hotbodies turn signal wires, so they can be unplugged easily if necessary.

I will never purchase jumper cables with wire thinner than four gauge. For you that don't know, the smaller the number, the thicker and heavier the wire is. The thinner the wire is on jumper cables the longer it takes to charge up the battery on the vehicle your jump starting. With four or two gauge jumper cables you can start a vehicle almost instantly on most occasions if you make good connections. I don't know about you but I usually end up having to jump or be jumped started in very cold conditions. I don't want to spend time messing around with the cables or having to wait for the battery to get enough juice to start the vehicle. I want to get into the car as soon as possible. These cables being made with four gauge wire will carry good current from one battery to the next. The clips are solidly built and the return springs on them are really stiff so they hold well on the battery termenials. These cables are twenty feet long which means you don't have to be lined up battery to battery sides on your vehicle which is not always an option. You have plenty of length to work with. Lastly, they give you a nice caring pouch to keep them stored in so they won't come unraveled between uses and keep them compact for storage. I have no problem recommending this product to anyone who is looking for jumper cables which I believe everyone should carry in there car or truck. I did purchase this product at a reduced price in return for a honest and unbiased revue. I hope I've helped you out.

so far so good install was a breeze, if they stand up to the test of time. They seem very strong so I think they will. the last photo is the mini, they turned out to be too small for the job and, the design is best for a jeep hood style application on the mini, eg: the longer pc w/ the rubber strap faces down to the fender and the catch bracket mounts on the vertical incline of the hood.

Asked my wife to order this tool and the dorman 911-048 for our 09 Hyundai Santa Fe since the fuel gauge is showing empty even when the tank is full and got the engine light ON. Scanned codes were for Fuel Senders.First, this tool will make your job faster and easier but it needs a little modification. Opening the ring was easy even the tool notches did not fully locked on the ring. But locking it back on was the hardest part, it is super tight, I even cracked my Harbor Freight 25 prof 1/2 B-Bar.Upon checking thoroughly, when locking the ring, the notch (reversed T shape like) of the tool is now set under the ring and it somehow prevents the ring to slip under its lock.As the other guys comment here, he grinded it down to make it thinner at least half from 3/16 to 3/32 i think. Since I don't have access to grinder, what i did was cut it using a hacksaw with steel blade and file it smoothly. Easy enough, next try was smooth as a butter on a hot pan. I am not sure for other vehicle but for Santa Fe, trust me, been there. Put some pics for you.A little tip: put the ring on the same position the way you take it off, it helps to fully lock it. Good luck! Hope it helps.

I have bought other handles before, and most of them you have to purchase individually.  I love how this comes as a set of two and that it is clearly stated as such.PROS:1: Easy to install2: Strong3: Comfortable to hang on to4: Fits just about any year Jeep Wrangler5: PortableCONS:NoneWe go on quite a few trips and rent Jeep Wranglers when we go 4-wheeling at some of our favorite islands.  Last summer we went on an off-road trip in Aruba and brought a set of handles just like these with us.  Past experiences taught us we never have enough places to hang on to when things get rough.  While my daughter-in-law has a jeep here at home and uses them here, we always pack a set with us whenever we travel.  The fact that these are portable make them perfect for trips.I received a free sample in exchange for my review.  I am impressed with the quality of these handles and rate them 5 stars based on our personal experience with them on my daughter-in-law's jeep.  I w \ould highly recommend them!

I'm quite the skeptic when it comes to As-Seen-On-TV types of items. However, I had a situation that I couldn't resolve with typical trim products. I own a 2012 Wrangler, which are notorious for quickly fading trim (bumpers, fenders, door handles, etc). I had been fine using the typical trim restoration solutions. It was just a acceptable chore every month. To further the issue, I got in an accident back in May, where they had to replace a fender and bumper with new ones. This resulted a huge contrast between the original parts and the new ones. In frustration, I purchased this at a local brick and mortar to give it a shot.I scrubbed down everything with dish soap and a brush, allowed to dry, and applied this in the shade on a Sunday morning. Wow. That's all I can really say. It's been on a week thus far and doesn't appear to be fading. I know that only time will tell how good this stuff really is, but immediate observations are impressive. You cannot tell that my old trim is 5 years older than the new pieces. Everything is a rich satin black. It may help that the trim is all textured, but the deep color came back without making it look wet or shiny. This products seems to penetrate the plastic, then seal it. It is quite vaporous and chemical, but that is probably because it isn't a silicone, but a polymer. Use in a well ventilated area. The only thing I dock it for is the quantity. While a meticulous approach might make it stretch, a bottle was only enough to do all of my exterior trim.Tip: If you notice streaks or splotches as it is drying, give it an hour and go over it with a second coat. This should soften the underlying coat, smoothing it out for an even appearance. I did this on all pieces I applied it to, and is probably the reason why the tiny bottle didn't go as far for me.

Found this hood protector when researching for our Nissan Frontier CB. 2 different types, the traditional "no drill" stand off the hood type and this new Aeroskin type applied with using 3M tape. After reading the reviews here I decided to give this one a try. The first Hood shield that arrived was damaged in the box and was returned. The second one arrived and was scratch free with the protective plastic still in place on the whole part. Prep work is easy, wash the area with car soap, dry, then wipe with the supplied alcohol wiping pads. What I did was to test fit and mark the hood with Blue Painters tape in several spots along the top edge of the shield. This will help when doing the final install. I also made a center line by putting a piece of tape on the protective plastic sheet in the center and transferring it to the tape on the hood.peel back the tape backing as suggested in the instructions, line up the shield and pull the tape by going along the edge. go several inches then follow with light hand pressure until that section is done.I gave this 5 stars bc the fit and finish are excellent. The shield adheres very well and now the leading edge of the hood has protection. I don`t see how this will help protect the windshield as it has no lip or flair to deflect anything. but all in all def worth a try...

it is adjustable so it can work for different size batteries BUT the length of the long bolts is NOT 8" as in the description and on the item packaging. The true length of the long bolts is about 9 7&7/8". I now have to hacksaw the bolt so that it will fit in my Honda Accord (1993) because the bolts are too high to close the hood! Plus the bracket itself rides high, about 2 inches above the top of the battery which is not a problem with my car.  I works but I wish I didn't have to do the extra cutting and filing

Fits nice and snug on my 2017 Toyota Tacoma Off-Road Double-Cab Short-Bed. Came in a little dirty, had to clean it up. Little marks on it after cleaning but nothing crazy or a big deal. Good price for an original Toyota part.

Wanted it to work, I bought a single one and then a double set from KeylessOption but none of them would program for my 2004 4Runner V8 Sport model. I tried each at least 5 times with quicker or slower times between the step of "Press both lock/unlock" then "Press lock".Also the buttons are especially bad and will fall out of their rubber waterguard gasket if you don't keep them on the bottom side when you take it apart to check or replace the battery.Then I bought one from NorthCoast directly for $30 each and it worked fine. The NC brand has what appears to be an identical PC board as the OEM Toyota one I have, whereas this KeyLossOption one is completely different. See attached photo. I say it's crap but it has good reviews so it may or may not work for you, I tried 3 of them and no luck.(Note: I actually bought the 2003 one from NorthCoast as it matched my FCC number HYQ12BAN, whereas the 2004 was a newer model.)

I give it 4 stars because it's made of plastic in the one I receive that minor flaws. Other than that great little novelty item. Comes with 3 rubber sleeves to attach to basically any manual. The trick is to select the smallest rubber sleeve .screw that on to the shifter first in your car. I actually had to use a pair of pliers to get the rubber sleeve to screw all the way down as tight as possible. That way when you insert the three little screws they don't just punch through the rubber.. after installing it held tight and secure

Nice, solid, and work great. Quality is great, price is excellent, but I'm not sure if I got sent a product that was previously return, one of the handles had a couple scratches. Also after having these in person, I think they would look 10x better being red with black foam.

I have a harley vrod night rod special and has a very tough battery location.  It was chore every time to hook up a trickle charger.  But now with this hooked up.  I can hook this up like I charge my phone.  No need to remove my air box or do any mods.  Cherry on top of the cake is it tells you the % of the charge which gives me peace of mind too.

I have a 03 BMW that still has the stock lights. This replacement fits and works 100%, but it's not the EXACT same K temperature. (In the picture: Original on the left, Philips on the right)Side note: picture makes the Philips look a little more yellow than it actually is in real life.Other than that, no complaints! Just switch out both bulbs if you're as OCD as I am :)

very easy to install ,the shock had to be compressed an additional three inch to get on my 2006 4x4 f150 5.4l. i have been driving 3 weeks with them now. they have met or exceeded my expectations. Seems like a good shock for the money. I have Rancho quik  lift on the front. They complement each other well. The boot  orientates to the bottom of the shock,which looked not right to me but is correct per manufactures web site.

Fits my 1986 C10 (standard cab, long bed 8') like a glove (size TB-4).  Covers bumper to bumper! I store the truck inside a steel pole barn, so this is to keep the dust off.  Works great for that.It's kinda hard to get on and off by yourself, but thats just because it's a pickup truck.  Not a fault of the cover.  I use a similar cover on a car and it's easier.

I purchased this 180w LED light bar for my RZR and it fits perfectly across the top.I have a smaller 72 W light bar that is straight but the design of this one is much better.It is curved which produces a wider beam  and it has little projector type lenses on each LED that cast the light further.When I first received this in the mail one of the corners of the metal housing was busted but the seller shipped me the part to replace it with no problem.This light has flood beams on the edges and spot beam projectors in the center. And in my  opinion if I had a decision it would've been nice to have all spotbeams because if you cover the edges of the light with cardboard the center still produces enough light that lights the area directly in front of you as well as throws the beam far.  There are no cones behind the projector lens that goes down to the LED to reflect the light underneath the lens. There is a 1 inch gap the whole width  under the lens that allows for some stray light up close that's why I believe it would be nice to have all projector lenses instead of floods in the ends.This light is super bright and throws the light a super far distance.  It comes with mounting brackets as well.The only bad thing I noticed about it is that when you turn it on and it has a slight sizzling sound inside.  (This is the only reason I am giving it for star instead of five) I'm not sure why some led's do this but I have a set of battery operated led lights that make the same noise? It is listed as having Cree  LED's but I cannot verify that all I can say is it works really well and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good led light bar.* I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review and my review is 100% my own honest opinion*Please feel free to ask questions

22. APR.2016It is all that it is advertised to be.It works well.The install takes some patience to get the #6 wires cut to the right length and then bent to line up with the lugs.But, that is no fault of the device, it's just the way it is.I put the remote display upstairs in my 5th wheel RV.It's nice to have the information available to me so that I can monitor what electrical devices and appliances I'm using and then make sure I do not trip a circuit breaker or overload the GenSet.

good level kit. i knew there was a possibility it would be a little more than a 2.5" and it was so now my front is a half inch higher than the rear. this will bother me so i will probably by the 2" spacer. The directions left out critical parts of the installation but thanks to youtube i was able to complete the install (after 2 different tries). I hate i'm going to have to do this all over again so my truck will be perfectly level.

This is a great kit and includes everything you need to fix a common issue, with not only the speedometer, but all the guages. The oil pressure guage on this particular truck was dropping to 0 at idle, as if the engine was worn. It just ended up being a flaky motor.The fork pry tool works well to remove the needles without damage to either the face or the needles themselves and can later be used for a variety of prying tasks. The only other thing you will need is a desoldering device, either a pump or braid. I use a pump personally and it works perfectly on the larger leads of these motors.Replacement is about an hour, if you are already proficient at soldering. I would use some painters tape and mark where the old motors bottom out as it makes installation a one step process, and was perfectly accurate. Many videos on how to do this.The cluster has a total of 11 illumination bulbs, so the 4 included won't repair a completely dark cluster, but are an added bonus if you have a few that are out.

I bought this for my MANUAL non-turbo Forester. Yes, it works for both auto and manual transmissions. I didn't need the transmission cooler lines so I jut left the caps on them. I'm not sure why some people claim it won't work... I've always used "automatic" radiators in my manual cars. They seem to be more readily available.This seems to be a much better alternative to the $150 radiators that all the major parts stores sell for these cars. I couldn't get myself to spend that much especially when they don't even keep them in stock locally. So I ordered this for half the price.The packaging was beautiful and not a single fin was bent when I opened the box. It perfectly matched the radiator that was in my 2003 Forester already. Took me a total of 30 minutes from start to finish to replace. I'm not a noob when it comes to car repairs but I'm also not a pro. All the mounts lined up perfectly. The holes for the fan screws were 1/8 inch off but it wasn't a problem getting the screws in.So far it is holding pressure and there are no leaks. I will update this if anything does go wrong in the near future.

simple and great organizer. I do wish it had a couple slightly larger slots as i have one or two tools that have really beefy handles. Other than that one complaint i think this a great organizer. It definitely helped clean up my tool box and help me make room for other tools to fit in that same drawer.

It works well! I do like the 360 degree coverage for matching the fender curves. I was worried that it might hold dirt and cause scratching but I don't see any evidence of that. I'm no expert, but because it is easily shaken off and can be washed I think it won't have that problem. I live in a particularly dusty farming community (as was noted very quickly by a visiting family member) and after a rain and then drying all day I found my car spotted and dusty of course so two swipes later as you can hopefully tell by the pics- clean! It works in one swipe if you just get dust on your car from driving or normal wind. This just happened to be water dried on dust which is a little harder to remove. It takes maybe sixteen seconds to wipe my entire car off. Not fifteen. Sixteen. You can spare the extra second for a shiny car, I promise!

I bought the front mats and rear mats for my 2000 Jeep Cherokee and they are amazing! FIT PERFECTLY AND LOOK AMAZING TOO. I like these so much I'm going to order the cargo mat as well! They are very heavy and filled with spikes on the bottom to hold into the carpet so they won't move an inch. Can't wait to get these things dirty to see how they really work.

Product is as described. It fits properly and looks good installed however makes a high pitch noise as air passes through it about 40 mph.  I assume it's because of the c-channel design of each gun.  Took the grill off and the noise stopped.

My review is for two of them: the brown one with the cover and the red one without the cover.The red trunk (description 23.6"x14.5"x12.6)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~My measurements are slightly different from the official description: a 22.5"L x 14"W x 10"H. Unlike my old trunk storage box I picked up at Costco it has rigid sides (thick cardboard inserts), so the sides don't flop over when it is not full. It folds up as an accordion when needed into a 14" x 10" bundle. The main compartment is divided into two sections, separated by a hard divider. In addition, it has 2 pockets on the outside on outside. The storage has no cover. The empty storage weighs around 4 pounds.The storage box has handles on the sides so it is easy to  move it around. It also has grommets on the narrow sides (2 on each side) so it has an option of being tied to something. The bottom has two rubberized feet and even though I have an all weather cargo mat (rather than the carpet) in my car's trunk under normal driving conditions it does not slide side to side in the trunk.I wanted to be able to carry a fully loaded trunk storage in and out of the house, so I attached a strap to two handles so I can carry the storage over my shoulder which makes it easier to carry when it is heavy.  The rigid bottom and sides allow me to this, where the old Costco storage would sag which made it uncomfortable to carry.The brown trunk (19.3"x11.8"x13"x8.3"x7.1")~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~My measurements of the trunk are: 19"L x 12"W x 13"H (tallest point).  What I like about is this trunk is that it has a cover, so I can close it and keep the content of the trunk private, if some looks through the window they cannot see the content of this storage.  It has a stiff bottom and side (think hardboard inserts), and the main compartment has a fold-out divider.  So it can either be one big area two compartments: 12" wide and 7" wide. This storage has Velco on the bottom, so if you have a carpet in the trunk it will prevent shifting. I use a cargo mat so the Velcro strips are not used but when it is loaded it does not move.  The trunk has four pockets: two on the outside and two on the inside.I am attaching a slide show with several images of the organizes in my car's trunk. Both trunks fit into my trunk side by side. I like them much better then the old floppy sided storage!These cargo trunks are provided by Geartist.Ali Julia review

i got two sets of this clamps already. they work great with the bed of my f150 supercrew short bed and the bakflip cover i have on it. it gives now 4 high points that i can move to one side or another to secure cargo, and so far, this clamps really grab it good. cant believe that my truck came without stake pockets on it... (well, they are there, but the plastic thing on top is not cut out) ... actually if i use to much force in the tie downs going to this clamps, looks to me like the bed rail is the one that is going end bending, long before the clamp will start moving or something like that. great product.

This was my review after finally putting these in and after one use: "These are really nice and hold up really well.  Will buy again when needed."But on the second use these are so pooly made that this garbage product broke.  The 24" one broke already; talk abouy complete trash.  My last wiper blades last 3+ years and these lasted less than 2 months and couldn't make it through two uses.  Complete garbage; see attached picture.Final update: contacted the company and they said that since I ordered them in October, but waited until just recently to install them and find out how poorly made these are, I am SOL.  I can understand their warranty issue, but this is a horrible product.  For a safety product, wiper blades are for driver safety to see the road, the material is sub-par and defective.  Maybe I got the one bad one out of thousands, but I will NEVER buy from this company again and caution anyone from buying a substandard product from them.  Worst experience from amazon.com that I have ever had.  Guess if two uses is what they stand by than this is your wiper blade, so factor that into the true cost of this junk.

This worked with one modification. The product is well made but in my opinion could have been designed just a little bit better.  The main problem is that the sandwich "thickness".  It comes with an oil pressure switch that has a large diameter so the sending unit hits the engine block and won't allow the sandwich seat.  I had to go to the hardware store to buy a 1/8 npt nipple and coupling to extend the sending unit further away from the sandwich to find a place where it would clear.  If it were just a bit thicker I think it would have worked without any modification.

This kit is almost perfect for our 1998 Jeep Wrangler, and I am glad that we purchased the option with the hardware package too.All six pieces look fantastic, and all six fit perfectly in the OEM holes left by the OEM fender flares we removed. The supplied hardware kit is functional, and the install job fairly easy though time consuming.  To facilitate taking the old flares off we removed the rear wheel well liners... and suggest that you do the same. Not a difficult job, and it makes getting to the back of the old, nasty, rusted hardware a ton easier. Also think about getting a small-handled 1/4 inch drive socket wrench with an 8mm socket.Total job, old flares off to new flares on, took our 16 year old son about 2 1/2 hours with minimal need for supervision.Sound like a 5 star review to you? Me too, except...The two side extensions, the small pieces that go between the front flare and the side step, seem to be patterned exactly after the OEM pieces. While they install easily:* When put in place, the cut of the front of the side extensions are not angled properly to align with the new, larger front flares. Instead, the angles are different, therefore the gap varies, and the outer corner of each side extension presses firmly against the flange of the front fender flare. This is going to rub like made and will wear quickly. (see picture)* It would have been nice if the side extensions were wider than 4-inch OEM width as to better match up with the width of the new flares.Hey... they look great, and we are going to see if we can trim the front of the side extensions to not rub against the front flares. If not, will live with it as is unless they wear a hole in the front flares.Bottom line: I like this set. The price was right, delivery was fast, the fitment with the OEM mounting holes of our 1998 Jeep Wrangler Sport TJ was perfect, and the hardware is usable.Looking for a set like this?RecommendedGo for it.

It's okay.Power is converted from US outlets @ 110 volts alternating current, to 12 volts of direct current.  The output is at 10 amps.  You should be able to plug in any 12 volt device up to 120 watts.  That will cover almost every cell phone, tablet computer, et cetera.The problem is that your vehicle is fused to 20 amps.  That means the power port or cigarette lighter was designed to put out 240 watts of power.  Therefore, there are 12 volt items that can and will use more than 120 watts.  Vacuum, refrigerator, stove, radio base units, et cetera.  Those items were designed to operate in a car.  It will not be safe to plug into this device.  Check your 12 volt accessory carefully, prior to attempting to power it with this device.Not everything made to operate off a vehicle's 12v 240 watt system will work with this.3 stars = It's Okay.I don't like it.  I don't love it.  It's okay.

I searched around for quite some time before purchasing these tail lights. They claim to use Phillips Lumileds which are the bulbs that Many OEM manufactures use in their led 3rd lights.Pros: They look good in my opinion. when behind the vehicle, they are brighter than oem tails, way brighter. There was no fitment issues.Cons: Not as bright from the side of the vehicle. ( Not an issue as brakes are meant for people behind you.) You'll need to remove the wire harness from your old tail lights. With led tail lights, you must test to see if it works before assembling. Just turn on your parking lights and if it doesn't work when you connect the LED connection, flip it the opposite way. With LED bulbs, they need the correct polarity while that doesn't matter on filament bulbs.Those are some extremely minor cons, I just listed them to list cons.I'll post a picture of the light reflection between oem and these tails. The OEM is on the left.

Stoked.  Looks great on my rig.  It's bright and flashy.  But, what are the 4 screws for?  It's not like you can drill these through the LED strip.  I wondered if this was a replacement for something else that came with some sort of metal strip with screw holes?  They instructions weren't super clear, but I figured out how to wire it up, with the help of Google and YouTube.  Whatever...I think the tape will hold for a while, so I'll have to make a decision when It comes off, to replace the tape, or toss it.  It IS only $30.  I think I'll get my money's worth.

Perfect replacement for my old, tired out light on my Coleman Pop-up. The LOCATION of the screw holes was slightly (around 1") off. No big deal to me. Looks great. Twice as bright as my old porch light. Very nice.

I already had one of these for a few years and really liked it so I ordered another one for my new second floor jack, but Prothane really, really cheapened this one since I bought the first one. The old one (the one on the LEFT in both pictures below) had had solid poly backing on the backside stepped down with the topside that made it very sturdy and able to withstand pressure. The new one is literally wafer-thin and does not have the solid poly backing of the old one. It deforms and gouges as soon as you put the weight of a car on it. You can see it in my topside picture (the pad on the RIGHT is the new one with gouges from just lifting my car once). It's plain cheap junk now. See my pictures for the difference between the original good pad (on the left in both pics) and the cheap pad they sell now (on the right side in both pictures): You can see the top looks identical, but on the back you can see that the new pad has NO reinforcing material. It's so flabby you can bend it with your bare hand!  I expected more from Prothane. NOT RECOMMENDED it will not last and is not sturdy enough to lift a car safely.

Like all the AVS products I have purchased for my Tacoma, I really like these door sill protectors. There really isn't much to say other than they fit perfectly in my 2006 Toyota Tacoma. They are very easy to put on and the tape they use is strong. I have no doubt these door sills will stand the test of time. I love how they protect both sides of the door sill corners. The factory door sills are paper thin and don't protect much.Another reviewer said they had trouble shutting the door after installing these, but I have not had a single problem. The door still opens and closes just like it always has. Thanks again, AVS!

I purchased Window-Weld for the purposes of repairing a worn out motor mount. The repaired mount has been installed for well over a year and its performing very well. This is a far less expensive option that purchasing a new mount. I believe this tube may suffice enough to repair about 2 motor mounts. I used the remainder to seal some leaking fog lights and it also served that purpose well. This is just a great product with various usages for the Do-It-Yourself-er.

I've ordered these twice now. They are great little lights and fairly bright at night! I put them under my truck and when I drive around at night I see everyone staring! The first time everything went great I accidently ripped one of the wires out of the back of one so I just ordered a second set. I had a little shipping problems on the second one I think they came 3 or so days late but not to bad. I would recommend them!

Amazing wax. Goes on smooth and quick, and buffs off quickly without excessive rubbing. Also, a little goes a very long way. I waxed my car twice and barely got below the neck of the bottle.Also, this is pure wax. there is no cleaners or polishers in this like most other waxes you get. What this means is you will likely want to make sure you have a clean and properly prepped surface first (think clay and touch up with a polish first) as little imperfections or water spots will not be removed by this wax, which you might be accustomed of not having to do. But I think you will be rewarded as you get a long lasting high gloss finish off this, that is easy to apply and not something you have to do often.

March 4, 2017 Update2 out of the 10 already started flickering! They're not the best on the market and not for every application, but the warranty and customer service is good. I received the replacements for the flickering bulbs in about a week. These are only good for interior lighting which is not too bright and just right in my opinion. If you want something that is super bright I would go with the JDM's extreme bright ones. Also these are not good for license plate lights, side markers, accent strips and etc. These are Interior only. I couldn't give it 5 stars because i wish they were just a little brighter and wish they would last longer because some do flicker pretty fast.Original ReviewI had these for about a week and got these to replace the incandescent in my 2013 Toyota Camry interior and they were perfect. The results as they are pictured. They are not too bright as some are way too bright for interior lightning. So far I don't have any issues with them. The only thing I didn't like about it is it's a bit expensive, but they are worth it in long run.

I have been using TMH lighting products for several years, without any issues or a single failure.LED village supplied me some samples to review, and this light like everything else they make is fantastic.It is insane how much light these put out, and they draw almost no power at all.  The case is high quality cast aluminum, super smooth, and with a satin black powder coating on them.  They include nice powder coated steel brackets and plated hardware suitable for outdoor installation.These draw a touch over 1 AMP at 12VDC, meaning you could easily run these off of outdoor power equipment that has weak electrical systems with no worry of over stressing them.  Your cigarette lighter in your car could safely power 10 or 15 of these, but you'd be arrested for blinding everyone around you.  1 or 2 of these on a car or truck, or an ATV/Tractor or other outdoor equipment is all you need for daylight level light in the middle of the night.Being Floods, you'd think they wouldn't throw light that far, but you'd be wrong.  At night you can see hundreds of feet in front of you.Simply awesome, buy some, you won't regret it!

Works great , see how long it holds up! Let me put 31s on. The rear is a real pain to put on. I had to use an air hammer and 1/2 air impact to get my old shackles off. Some say you need a trac bar relocation , I ordered one but didn't look like I needed it. You will need longer shocks or bar pin eliminators to make the shock longer

Nice light bar for a great price. Does have a hot spot as you can see in the pic. Hasn't leaked any water on the inside or have any condensation inside. Been through lots of car washes and a few nice snow storms. Definitely recommend. Knocked off 1 star due to the small Crack on the reflector.

I bought this rack because I liked the overall look. HOWEVER, looking back this was a HUGE mistake. Upon putting it together, the company used bent rods, which I had to bend back to make it work, also the front fairing didn't line up correctly, so I had to make it FIT !!!!!! Scratched the paint so BAD that I now have to REPAINT IT !!!!!! Overall this has been a BLOODY NIGHTMARE !!!!! CHEAP CHINESE GARBAGE !!!!UPDATE!!!!! I Re-engineed it to make it work with my Jeep Patriot. In the middle of repainting it now, because after one rainfall it started rusting. In the one hand though, looks teally BOSS on my Jeep.

I've ordered this very item probably 10 times in the last 2 years and always gotten a Wesbar brand wiring harness in retail packaging.  This time I got what appears to be a cheap made in Taiwan knockoff.  Instead of the wire insulation being the same color all the way through, the plastic on all the wires is brown (lighter in color than the genuine Wesbar) and the green and yellow is paint over the brown plastic.First picture shows original Wesbar on the left, the knockoff on the right.Second picture is the same as the first, with better lighting to show that the insulation on the knockoff is painted.Third picture shows the packaging the item comes in.Don't know what happened...bring the real deal back and I'll boost this rating!

I like this unit so far. Installation was straight forward. I replaced a mechanical battery isolator made by Cooper Industries (Sure Power 1314) with the Battery Doctor. I like this unit's ability to Isolate and Bridge batteries as necessary on the fly. Works as advertised and the user selected option are convenient. Instructions are good and simple. Make sure you install a circuit breaker/Fuse on the AUX battery as denoted in the instructions. It needs to be 150 Amp. I installed this unit on my Polaris Ranger. Pictures included.  I don't drive my Ranger every day so the 30 mA standby power draw is a concern. So as stated in the instructions insert a switch between the unit and the Ground. Black wire with ring.

These light are a perfect replacement for the 912 bulb. The light output of these bulbs is a clear white, unlike other cheaper LEDs, these do not produce a blueish tint. The light out put on these is amazing. They are very bright.  Overall great 912s. I received this item in exchange for a fair and honest review.

This is the kit I started with. One of the bushings broke while I was pressing it in with a special tool, so I bought the Redhound kit for half as much. The auto parts store only had two kits in stock, and a bushing kit that had 16 bushings, each one a different size. To blazes with buying 14 extra bushing that do not fit anything I own, so I went with the Red Hound kit, and will NEVER buy Dorman unless there is not alternative. I returned one Dorman kit, and used Red Hound kits top and bottom. Use a 5/16" bolt with a Belden washer & nut and two large flat washers to pull the bushings in. Be sure to put the FLAT WASHERS ON THE BUSHING FLANGES. The Belden washer may break off the shoulder flange on the bushing. Use a 9/16, 14mm, or 15mm open end wrench to finish pulling the bushing all the way into the hole.

Very easy install, excellent quality, and great price for these on Amazon!However, I hate modified cars, they 9/10 look awful and I thought I had ruined my car after installing these.  I ended up removing them immediately and spray painting the mufflers matte black with high temperature paint to to make them look stock (picture posted).  Now the only part that is chrome are the tips and it looks more like they belong on the car - I just wish the tips looked a little less obnoxious.Secondly, I was very disappointed by the sound - after hearing the exhaust note from a G37 coupe I really wanted my sedan to sound the same.  These mufflers are slightly louder, but they don't have the awesome rasp or burble of the coupe.  On the plus side these are never annoyingly loud and still allow you to drive through the neighborhood without causing your neighbors to hate you.In the end I've figured out that 1) this was the best exhaust purchase as far as price, appearance, and keeping the sound at a tolerable but louder than stock level 2) I should have bought a coupe.'07 G35 S Sedan 6MT

OVERVIEWI couldn't find a genuine leather steering wheel cover to protect the factory wheel without have to pay an amount like I am replacing the entire steering wheel column. Every year or so I have to keep buying the pleather covers that crack and then absorb bacteria in those cracks. Finally I found one priced at the level of the knock offs!PROS-Genuine leather-Comes with a dust cover in case you don't install it right away (see attached photos)-Comes with two air fresheners-Non pourous pattern that doesn't collect debris. See the pattern in the up close photograph-Only one seam at the bottom of the cover-Fits smaller steering wheel sizes (it fit my BMW sports car steering wheel of which I couldn't find any to fit this well at retailers. The entire diameter of the cover is 15 inches witch fit around the 14" wheel. The smallest ones I could find for the BMW are still slightly loose and occasionally slide so this was perfect)CONS-Didn't fit my Jeep Wrangler Sahara wheel which is about the US SUV standard size-May need to moisturize the leather for longevity (also avoid harsh chemicals or interior cleaning product direct contact)PRICE$-$$ out of $$$$$. Priced significantly lower than comparable genuine leather covers however I've never found this smaller size in a retail location. The price is comparable to cheap plastic covers that don't last very long but the quality is that of thick leather. I received this product at a slight discount in exchange for my honest review but would have easily paid full price years ago had I known this would finally fit the smaller sport car size I couldn't find anywhere else. I originally purchased it for my Jeep but got a lucky find in that it is slightly smaller than the standard sizes.

Got this as a Christmas present. I don't have a place for that center screw to go into, because I have an aftermarket radio and took that bracket out. No worries! Just used a slightly oversized screw and it's solid!I used the tripod threads to mount a HAM radio control head (TM-v71a from Kenwood) and it worked out perfectly.Very stable and I recommend. Just wish the screw wouldn't loosen so often but I may locktite it.

Great price, first of all considering how high quality these are, I cannot stress that enough. They shipped extremely quickly, and came very well packaged, including foam wrapping, plastic around the edges and covering the screws, even a microfiber fitted sheet thing to ensure they wouldn't scratch during shipping,all wrapped up in plastic I was impressed. I put them on my 2010 2dr JK Wrangler, I'm not a huge fan of the protectors, so I didn't get them. They have taken more abuse than they should have and have held up well. A friend managed to run one into a curb, I expected the wheel to be heavily scratched, but the finish is ridiculously tough, even though there were chunks of concrete ground off the curb, no damage to the wheel. I highly recommend, the pictures don't do them justice, they look great in person. The only downside is the ugly centercap, but they offer better looking options.Update:They are holding up incredibly well, it's been 4 years, I recently bought a replacement, my spare was damaged in an accident.The description is wrong, the no longer come with the river center cap they now come with part 15305.51 Matte Black Center Cap for XHD Wheel, which look better.

Have used this to mount 8 different decals on my Jeep Wrangler and because it has a felt stretched over one side I am more inclined to use it since it glides smoothly over the backing paper surface and will not dig in like the hard, smooth, non-felt covered side. I can really recommend this as the felt covering improves the action of the squeegee moving out the air from between the decal and the mounting surface.

I got these grips for a 2013 CBR500R. Install was easy. There is a plug under the seat for accessories that can be spliced into to give it the right voltage. It also tuns it on and off with the ignition key. I didn't use the glue that came with this. I used good old fashion hairspray. It hasn't come lose yet. Grips get nice and hot. They are thicker grips then stock.  Since it slides over the throttle tube and doesn't require replacing the throttle tube it is an easy install.  Running the wires takes a little bit of doing but it's not horrible.  The product seems solid.  I'll update if something changes.

The brush I use, like most car was brushes is angled where the pole screws into it, so when I dip it into the bucket only 1/3 of the brush actually brushes against the insert. This is when using a Home Depot bucket, not a regular one, which wouldn't be a tall and would clean more of the brush.

This thing might not be hardcore but it's a beefy bumper and a lot less than something from a fab shop. It definitely looks good on my Jeep.  I did have to grind the welds on the frame rails to make it fit. Took all of 5 mins to grind and paint. After grinding it fight no problem. I drilled some holes and tapped them so I could mount my front plate.

I looked to Amazon for a filter after the local Honda dealership wanted $41 for the S2000's cabin air filter.  I though that was a bit outrageous.After a bit of searching on S2KI, a few people had tried this, but never reviewed it.  Don't be afraid to buy this, fellow S2000 owners!Pros:-cost ($41 or $9, you choose)----- There are other outlets to get the OEM filter cheaper, but not $9 (think $26).-fits like OEM-build quality + looks just like OEMCons:-none

Unfortunately, or perhaps, foolishly, I own three vehicles with polished aluminum wheels. They are all custom wheels with no lacquer finish to protect them. One is a 4X4 (Isuzu Trooper) that sees duty in all kinds of weather. One is a "classic car" that is generally protected and the last is a PU which is always subject to weather.The Trooper was driven to Kansas City this last winter when they were having some of the worst snow and ice in MO for many years. That meant road salt and other ice melting chemicals were in use while the Trooper racked up more than a thousand miles of driving. The (forged Centerline) wheels were inundated and only washed once before spring. Needless to say, they suffered considerable corrosion before I had a chance to clean and polish them.I had been using the PowerBall to polish the Centerlines, and in the East Tennessee climate, they would become only moderately corroded through the winter and the PowerBall (along with a great deal of hand polishing) would bring them back to near-new condition. After the K.C. trip, however, they were in much worse condition, so I used a buffing wheel similar to the ones in this kit. It worked well, but it was a typical flat wheel held onto the drill with a long screw and a couple of washers. Though the conventional buffing wheel did well, it's shape and the exposed screw head limited its usefulness.When I discovered that the (American Racing cast) wheels on the classic car, stored outdoors, but under a cover, were also moderately corroded, I decided to try this kit along with some brown Tripoly (aluminum polish) from Sears.The collection of various shapes and sizes of buffers made the process much, much easier and far more professional than the PowerBall. Plus, you get this entire kit for about the price of one PB. Also, the Tripoly really works if you need to take off serious corrosion like you might find on some "flea market" used wheels. However, in my case, I found the best results by using the buffing wheels and Meguiars Metal polish. The Tripoli removes the corrosion quickly, but does not leave the high luster shine you get from Meguiars (or similar).Obviously, these buffing wheels should work just as well on other aluminum items such as valve covers, etcetera.

These things are seriously bright I've used this company a lot and am always satisfied. The only problem with led bulbs is newer vehicles can't sense such a low amperage draw so you have to trick the computer to turn on the lights with a resistor or by rewiring the circuit.

I purchased these lights for my Can-Am Commander. After getting them installed and trying them out I will say that I am very impressed with how they work. The 50 inch curved light bar is extremely bright and works much better than I was expecting. The wire harness that came with the light bar worked great. I decided to buy an additional wire harness for the other two lights because I wanted a relay along with the fuse so all the power was not running through the on/off switch. Both on/off switches worked great but I decided to buy additional switches that match the factory switches in my Commander.

I bought the 21009 hoodflector for my F150, and it looks sweet with my all black grill. This is the slim version, so it does the job of protecting the front hood edge without looking too big. Installation was easy and took about 20 minutes total. Be sure to really clean the surfaces where the mounting tape goes to ensure good adhesion. There are 2 screws included that go into the underside of the hood (you will need to drill 2 small holes for the screws), so it's pretty darn secure overall. I'm very satisfied with this product.

I had one marker light that kept going out one day and on the next day.  So I decided to use these bulbs and replace both marker lights.  BIG difference.  The new led marker light is MUCH brighter.  Oh....I happen to have a 2008 VW Passat, the only way to change the bulb is go into the wheel well.  It's pretty easy, just unscrew one screw, peel back the plastic wheel well and reach into the marker light area.  There is a 'rubber' cap over the marker light.  There's a video on youtube that shows how.Update:  a day later the bulbs will only stay on for 15 to 30 seconds.....something to do with my car or the bulbs.....anyway....I put normal bulbs and the normal bulbs work....like normal.  To bad these did not work for me

We purchased 2 of these after not being satisfied with just using standard wheel chocks. Wow!, what a difference these make in the stability of our trailer. No more back and forth movement. Very easy to install and remove. I just use my drill with a 3/4" socket to get them close and then finish tightening them with the supplied wrench. Kind of expensive, but should last a lifetime.

Exact fit on my 1994 Toyota pickup with 22RE engine. Air flow is not too restrictive and I felt a little bit horsepower gained from the old engine. Being able to compressed air clean this is a plus, a little bit of savings right there.

The heading says it will not fit a 2015-2016 Ford F150. They do, and they're amazing! They're super crisp with a very good cut off. These have a clear hot spot that when aimed properly, do not blind oncoming drivers. Youtube has a video showing the installation. [...]I am very happy with these.

This is a high quality product, the LED bar is solid, well protected and definitely not cheap looking. Nothing about it is, even the connectors and cabling are sturdy and made for easy installation.BUT do some good some research before buying these and make sure that they DO fit into the grill or fog-light area of your car. Because while it says universal fit, it unfortunately did not entirely fit into the fog-light area of my 2012 Nissan Altima Coupe. I could've put it on the grill by the license plate but I wanted these where I believe they are meant to be located, right under the headlights.While I had enough horizontal space the depth of the LED's were too much for the fog-light area of my car so the LED bar was sticking out looking like a cheap-added-on installation so I decided to return it.Also, be sure to note that these are a bright 6000K color. These will mimic the lights and look of modern Audi, Acura, Mercedes, and/or BMW headlight and LED lights. That was my other issue, the highest halogen light I was able to find were 5000k so the LED bar (while it looked great as you'll see in the photos), it did not match my headlights and I hated that.INSTALLATION HELP: For those seeking some help as far as cabling goes here's some advice.BEFORE installing anything be sure to turn off the car and of course TEST that these work as intended.Purchase an "add-a-circuit" adapter that fits your car (standard, mini, mini low profile, or micro) with a 10a amp fuse. The add-a-circuit adapter goes into the fuse box of your car, find a fuse that you would feel comfortable messing with (something that uses 10 amps is fine). Also keep in mind that there's such a thing as constant-on and powered-on fuses (constant-on works all the time, powered-on only works when the car is on or when a certain accessory is switched on by hand). Here's an add-a-circuit adapter that fit into 2012 Nissan Altima Coupe (mini low profile): http://amzn.to/1NdarLfI used the fuse that turns on when the clearance (yellow) lights come on, I also liked it because they also use 10a amp fuse. You can use/test others but I found these to be the best for this purpose and because I felt comfortable knowing that if something goes wrong and the fuse blows I won't have clearance lights but at least I'd have a functioning car compared to blowing a core fuse like the Starter or Steering Lock.The add-a-circuit adapter will give you a safe to use RED cable input where you can insert the LED's red wire into. The black one is easy, just install it anywhere on the metal body frame of the car (there are plenty of small metal holes all over the car where the black wire can be wrapped around or even wrenched for a negative/ground connection). And this will ensure that the lights will turn on without issues.You can then install the LED lights as needed, use zip or twist ties to neatly run the cables up to the fuse box. Not only will it look professional but with the use of the add-a-circuit adapter you will have a safely installed LED bar.Good luck!

Kind of cheap and flimsy lots of slop. I installed it on the back of my fifth wheel camper which may bounce a little more than on a car. After a mile trip I returned home to find that one of the side supports holing the upright bar had cracked and broken. Luckily I did not lose my bikes but had I gone a couple more hours or hit a few more rough patches in the road I believe the other side would have gave out too. It was already starting to bend anyway. I think it was a bad design. I contacted Curt and they did send me a whole new rack. I needed it the following weekend and the new one hadn't arrived yet so I repaired the one I had. I welded the piece back together and added a gusset to both sides. That is what it should have had to begin with. I also replaced the pin that lets the upright fold up or down with a bolt. This helped take a lot of the movement out of the rack. One of the reason I purchased this one was it folded in different ways and unfortunately now it doesn't. Unless you need a rack that folds several ways I would suggest something with less moving parts. If I can find them I will attach some pics so you can see this weak spot in the design.

Excellent and inexpensive. Don't pay hundreds for a motorcycle bag. Used it on my 3 week motorbike trip and did not have any issues with it. You may want to use different tie downs like bungee cords. Make sure you also tie down the protective waterproof bag, mine blew away on the first ride!

This squeegee really helps drying your car after a car wash. It makes the drying process faster. It removes large areas of water so you can quickly dry the car using microfiber towels. Be sure to wipe the squeegee after each pass on the vehicle to avoid any loose dirt from scratching the paint.

A bit flimsy but they work for what I needed them for. I ended up using just sections of the wires and tossed the switch, as I am wiring directly into an sPOD. Use some good quality crimpers and connectors and you're set.

I bought this to go with my new camper that does not have a rear bumper. It was on a deal of the day so only paid like 80 bucks for it. Installation isn't much of an issue as its a simple design and straight forward. You have bottom mounts that go on the outside of the A-Frame and brackets that bolt to the back of the A-Frame to hold in place. I ran into my first issue with the back brackets as I have an electric box on my frame that I couldn't relocate. To get around this I have 1 bracket at an angle instead of straight up and down, this allows the bottom bolt on one side to hold both brackets. I did add a piece of steel to fill the gap this created. So note that you may have issues if there are a lot of things on your frame.I tow my camper with a suburban and all the YouTube videos I found showed the camper with a pick up and you can clearly see the bikes hanging over the bed during sharp turns. This concerned me to the point I almost didn't buy it as I was afraid I wouldn't get my 4 bikes on the rack without hitting the back window of my Suburban. Took a chance when it went on lightning deal so I only paid 80 bucks so if I only could get 2 bikes on it wouldn't be hard or costly to put the other 2 on the SUV's roof rack.Well during installation my fears were realized, the bars that go between the bottom mount and the top bar are curved so you can turn them and accommodate a wide range of A-Frame sizes. Where I could mount the bottom mounts due to propane tanks, battery mounts, and an electric box pushed the top bar so far forward I risk hitting the tires of the bike with just 1 bike on let alone 4. To get the to bar as far back as possible meant doing some cutting and welding. I took almost a foot of each side of the top bar and remounted the mounting brackets to push the top bar as far back as possible (note to manufacturer, an adjustable top bar would be awesome).Lastly, it was a bit of a pain drilling thru the support bars so that I could put screws all the way thru to tighten it down. Not hard to do but took up time. Which I came across a review that said this is hard to remove if you have a camper with pull out beds in the front, I could see that being a problem, I don't have pull out beds but if you do you may have to cut the support bars shorter to get under the bed.All in all the set up of this product took longer as I had to modify it a lot to make it work for me. But for 80 bucks I am happy to report it did work. The pictures show that I got all 4 bikes on and had about 4 to 6 inches of clearance between bike tires and rear window during sharp turning, which may come to be a problem when my youngest gets to a full size bike but I can worry about that in a few years.

I've had a set like this for years on my Mercedes 300D with no problems. I was worried about losing some so I got myself some spares.What I like about these is they have a nice fat O-ring inside that seals the orifice, keeping the valve clean. Yes the sleeves may or may not fit, but I'm not worried too much about the sleeves.Package arrived the day it was shipped. What I was surprised about is that the packaging said these may not be safe for vehicles equipped with TPMS. That's fine for my 300D which has standard metal valves (no TPMS), but since I wanted to try these for my newer cars that have TPMS I wonder why there's such a warning?

I love the look this gave my jeep! Great quality! Very easy to put on.  I am a mom of 4 children 10 and under and I put this on by myself in less than ten mins.First you take off your tail light. Then there are 4 tab you need to push in to loosen the existing door once those are loose you lightly rock the existing door back and forth to get the door and rubber piece off.  Once off remove the rubber piece and place on the new door.  Then you put the new door on by getting the rubber piece around the fuel line once on push all four tabs on. Put the cap on and tail light back and your done.  Very easy.  If you need help there are also videos on you tube

Not worth the money. The fit is horrible, loose and yes I ordered the right size. The build quality is OK but they are different in terms of being puffier than in the picture where they look like a snug fit. They have too much material in the palm area and will produce bad feeling when gripping the handlebars. Do not be deceived by the picture. Mine even came with a little tear in the "leather". Can't be bothered to return them so I guess I'll have to wear them. Bad investment.

Great product!  Doesn't come with carabiners or clips so goto the hardware store and pick up at least four of them; cost should only be a few bucks.  I strongly suggest that you also purchase some Bull Rings for side of the truck (Bull Ring Bullet Side Wall Retractable Tie Downs) or a similar product.  I purchased a set of four Bull Rings, two for the rear and two for the front.  The cargo net stretches across the width of my truck (2015 Colorado long box) just fine.

This tread depth gauge works perfectly. It took me a minute to realize how to read it, because it skips like 2 numbers in between each number, but then I realized that you just spin until the very bottom perfectly matches with a number. This is great, too often the mechanic tells you it is time to change your tires, well now you can check for yourself to see if it is really necessary.I found the motion was fluid yet had resistance, which is perfect you can tell this is high quality its also quite small and compact. Just be careful not to lose it!

First off these are BIG ( pics to follow ) and they are LOUD and have a GREAT SOUND, I have not put them in yet ( going to be a bit  of a project due to the size of these ) but I HAD TO HEAR THEM when they got here  lol which BTW Amazon REALLY came through on this one ordered them and they showed up in TWO DAYS and on a Saturday to boot.Couldn't wait to hear them so I temporarily hooked these up to my 60gal air compressor in my garage with a hose run to them OUTSIDE ( DON'T TRY THESE INDOORS, THEY WILL HURT YOU )  to test it out and they live up to the hype  LOVE HEARING THE ECHO OF A TRAIN HORN Are they AS LOUD as a REAL train horn? NO but they are close and at 1/10 the cost they are just AWESOME, loud enough to let EVERYONE within a mile or two know you are there for SURE.  And even though I did warn my family as to what was coming they still jumped, dogs ran off, and even the horses said we are out of here lolFor the money these are just AWESOME hope they last, can't wait to get them installed,it appears that the included bracket can be removed so mounting options are "adaptable"  the only reason for the one missing star is the 1/4" input on these my system is 1/2" - other than that NO COMPLAINTSPICS and a follow up after installUPDATED INFO FROM WOLO tech support -  I am running a 150psi system and was curious if this was too much for this horn? I was right.  This morning I called Wolo's tech support and found out that the recommended system pressure for this horn is 80-110psi.  I asked what the MAX pressure this horn should receive and was told 110psi,  so I just had to order a  1/2" regulator to be able to turn down the pressure to this horn on my system.Another expense,  but having a regulator on the horn line will allow me to adjust pressure for a good sound and prevent risking damage to the horns -  I guess  lolTWO MONTHS of use update - They still sound great ( at times almost too loud lol ) they will scare the **ap out of people even when they KNOW that they are there.  I did kind of find out the hard way that these WILL SOUND on low pressure - my gauge read ZERO so there was probably less than 10psi on my system but when I pressed the horn they still sounded off LOL  sounded pretty pitiful, but still sounded off. Can't wait to be able to put my Graham White valve in and make these sound like they are truly supposed to.A YEAR LATER  and still going GREAT

Easy mounting options, wire fits snug around gromets and looks stylish. It didn't come with a Fuse which it might have said that in the add but i don't remember so i was surprised when it was fuseless. And RF want like $20 for the fuse so bought cheaper stinger fuses.But all in all very happy with them, i needed 4 for my install and look professionally done in my application.Rock on RF!

This is a review of the FIT Tools Wiper Arm Remover.Summary  I needed to replace a 2006 Saturn Vue rear wiper motor and this tool was just what I needed. The prong width and depth was fine for my use. The prongs are 1  cm wide and the depth of the prongs is 1. So if you are not sure if this is for you, simply use a ruler to check before ordering.In terms of build quality, I am very happy with this for the cheap price I paid. It is very solid and while I wish the turn knob was coated in a soft plastic or rubber, it works and gets the job done.Nothing not to like and does what I wanted. If this develops issues with ongoing use, I will update this review accordingly. Thank you!

There's not a lot of parts to this setup, which is good- and all of them seem to be well made and heavy-duty, which is also a big plus-- except for the collars that attach the mounts to the round roof bars.  And you know what they say about something only being as strong as its weakest link...  Maybe there's no need for the plastic collars to be any more robust than they appear but, when I tighten down those straps, there can be a pretty good amount of force bending those arms against those two little plastic collars.  I guess the safest thing to do is make sure the bars and in turn the kayaks are positioned in such a way so to keep the arms of the mount straight up and down (and not pulling off-axis).Otherwise, very pleased with this mount. Good heavy duty straps and tightening cogs to keep the kayaks firmly in place.  Love that I can carry three kayaks and still have roof rack left over for bikes.The other minor issue I noticed with this type of mount is the wind resistance. With the 'rear-load' type mounts where the kayak is laying down, there's inherently less wind resistance. With this type, I really noticed cross winds at highway speed- especially when it was catching the cockpit side.

Total bald faced liars. Says it supports 2003 Chrysler airbag codes but it does not produce any usable codes. Waste of money. I SPECIFICALLY asked if this supported airbag codes on 2003 PT Cruiser. I was told yes.Well, it returns some kind of codes. But there are NO descriptions of any of these codes either in the device OR on the Innova website. Additionally, they do NOT seem to correlate to any published Chrysler codes.When I contacted support they told me Chrysler doesn't publish codes for SRS system. If thst is the case they should not lie and say this provides codes for 2003 Chrysler.Undocumented garbage is garbage.Attached are a bunch of worthless codes. Not documented anywhere. If anyone could provide me CHRYSLER definitions (not GM, not Opel) for these codes, that would be great. Innova sure doesn't bother, even after telling me it would work for me when I asked.

Nice replacement fobs! Very easy to program step 1. Get inside your truck & close the door. Step 2. Put your key in the ignition & while holding the unlock button on the door down turn the key on & off twice ( without starting the engine) step 3. On your fob press & hold the lock & unlock buttons for about 15 seconds ( the doors in the truck will lock & unlock when the fob is programed) step 4. You have to program all the fobs at the same time even your old ones or they won't work anymore.  After your done programing your fobs turn the key in the ignition on one more time (not starting the engine) to take the truck out of program mode. Check each fob to make sure their working. It's that simple these fobs don't feel cheap at all the housing & buttons feel & look identical to the factory set I highly recommend!

Received as a Christmas gift from the wife for autocross. Fits nice and snug as it should. Lots of vents and the SNELL rating is a definite plus. Visibility is good and the included smoke shield and carry bag are nice additions. I got it in Black and it's a great canvas for adding sponsored decals or just to show my support of certain products. a SNELL rating at this price point and this many neat additional features can't be beat.

Great product. It takes a bit of skill to remove the radio and the trim but it should be do-able for most. I would HIGHLY suggest ordering a few trim retaining clips (part number 51458266814). A few of these broke during my installation, but they are $1/pc. I also chose to mount mine without the plate and put it in the dash. It takes a bit more time for disassemble this way.Also make sure when you secure the aux with the trim ring that the side with the grove faces outwards. These groves will allow you to use a screw driver to loosen the trim ring later for removal.Also if you have difficulty pushing the radio back in, you may have routed the cable in an area that the radio needs to be.

Well... in order to properly install this you will need a press of some sort.  It is a VERY hard rubber that will not easily slip into specified hole.  I tried to install it by hand while the components were on the vehicle but in doing so, the rubber was actually cracking between the smaller holes. I could not get it in and I don't feel like disassembling the necessary parts to press it in properly.  I have decided to go with a more permanent solution of purchasing 2-  5/8" ball joint ends, and matching hardware from McMaster Carr. I also used a 7" rod with 5/8-18 tapped ends.60645K17192240A48294945A230

Review date: 4-8-2015, Revision: A.This oil is NOT spec'd as meeting SF that I need, however, I think the (ACEA) A3/B4-08 of this oil may...My 1987 Toyota turbo truck takes 10W-40, API SF/CC oil. The belief that superseding oil (Example: SN) will work, is simply incorrect. 22RE have sliding tapits (cam followers) and are subject to cam scoring. Newer oil had the ZDDP or zinc reduced, do to concern about oil blow-by contaminating the CAT.  10W-40 SF or SF/CC is currently not available to is crazy expensive.  SF is what is required for engines that had cam shafts without rollers...TMI (for car/ gear head types):My newly rebuilt engine back in ~2005 was damaged badly enough, at less than 80k miles, causing me to have it fully rebuilt again (this engine normally goes to 200K or more). I used standard name brand synthetic SN oil (not this oil, I am reviewing). I think the engine damage was, in part caused by, this now known SN don't replace SF oil problem.My oil was changed every 3,000 miles (OEM spec'd changes at 2,500 miles on, old spec'd non-synthetic oil (its factory turbo charged), I used name brand high-end full synthetic oil (10W-40 winter and 20W-50 summer time. The filter was changed each time. The cam followers were replaced with the new cam, when the engine was fully rebuild the first time. I had all sorts of scoring issues - maybe this was the cam shaft/ follower metal contamination, do to the excess were?The bottom line (as far as I know/ educated guess):So, if you have an older car, 1980's or older, most newer oils are not so good for your car. I believe that all ENEOS oils of the proper grade are safe for older cars and trucks:http://www.eneos.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ENEOS-Fully-Synthetic-Motor-Oil-Product-Data-Sheet-2014.pdfMy engine was re-rebuilt in ~2007, and I now have ~20K miles on it. It was rebuilt to a more modern tight spec, so I believe that the 5W should be OK in a 10W-40 engine, as the 5W or 10W refers to the cold temperature oil thickness, and its usually above 32F but below 50F here in the mornings. I was told by a Turbo specialist, that 20W-50 is too thick, unless ran always above 100F (never started below that temperature). He said to use European spec'd 15W-40, or 5W-40 oil.

The design leaves a large amount of carpet exposed around the gas pedal on the driver's side. I'm sure snow and mud can get behind there. Passenger side leaves too much carpet exposed and doesn't fit snug to contours even after warming them up.  I'm sure there are better choices out there for a 2001 Silverado.Update.. giving these 1 more star. After having 6 weeks of sloppy weather with mixed snow and below zero I've come to appreciate these in my truck. Apparently not going up behind the gas pedal isn't such a big deal. The carpet is clean and dry underneath. Having a pan style floor liner really traps the melted snow and the shape makes it easier to dump out when you move your seat back. Raised tred pattern keeps ice build up from being slippery.

Cheap and it works great for controlling my outdoor LED lighting. I wouldn't expect it to last very long if exposed to direct rain. The circuit board inside has no protection against water or corrosion. The wires are also too short to really do anything with, so I had to solder and shrink wrap longer wires onto them.

There are some lower-priced units that gets really strong reviews. And if you're comfortable paying one or two hundred bucks less rather than getting a safety-certified, US-made unit from a company that's been making these for years and will warranty them for years, go for it. But lots of players in this space are relatively new, their products are NOT safety tested, some of the overseas work isn't as supervised, and that's just not a combination I want in my garage or connected to my Bolt. Extra few hundred bucks for three-way peace of mind (reliability, safety, and warranty)? Yes, please! I saved that on gas last week alone! ;)

Well this cover has a three year warranty and that's exactly how long it lasted, 3 winters. Other than it's durability and longevity it was a pretty good cover. The zipper access that is supposed to allow you to get into the side door is way too low which makes it ineffective. Basically the zippers need to go up higher.I'm a little disappointed, obviously I'll need a new cover for next winter, probably not going with this brand again. - Dave

I bought 2 pair of these and they are great as back up lights from the spare tire on my wrangler! On all these lights, I back out one screw at a time and add 1 drop of clear silicon in the thread area, then reseat the screw. (do NOT remove them all at the same time) I also run a tiny bead around the edge of the lenses.UPDATEThe exposed HW is rusty, advise that you clean bare metal with alcohol and hit with black enamel spray paint.

The cargo carrier arrived to my house in 3 days in great shape even though it was a heavy item.  I was afraid the box would be crushed but it wasn't.  The package had two layers of boxes which helps to protect the cargo carrier while transport.  This cargo carrier comes into two sections, which requires simple assembly using a ratchet socket and a box wrench of the same size to tighten the bolts and nuts.  Further examination of the tray, the welds are not perfect but it will make do for its price.  Overall the cargo carrier is sturdy and functional.  The best part of this cargo carrier that it is fold-able while it is on the hitch.  It does not come with a hitch pin / lock, so that is something you must have to use this carrier.  My purpose for the cargo carrier is to carry my snowblower and camping gears.  So far I am very happy this cargo carrier and would recommend this to others for it's price and size.

Acura MDX 2006, my hose started to detach from the thermostat housing.  I heard about issues with transmission and coolant fluids mysteriously mixing from the radiator. Decided to change out with new hoses and the old factory Denso radiator.  Pretty good fit, only big difference is the clips for the screw holes (no issues).  Its been about 2 weeks and no problems.  I highly recommend using NEW Honda constant tension hose clamps.

These are okay for the price.  However after one handwash of the truck a few days after purchase & installation, one of these units has a small condensation spot inside the dome.  The spot is still there a week later.  The truck is kept in a heated garage.

While it fit fine, within a week the mount was collapsing.  The picture shows the gap from only one week of driving.  The sceond picture shows the mount after I removed it.  Notice the cracks already forming after a week. This happened on both sides of the GTI and Jetta.  So I'm out four mounts and have to replace them.

I'm loving this tonneau! Easy to install, nice quality, and it does the job! It was a little tough for me to figure out which slot the latches should go in so it was centered with my bed rail system (it was the middle ones for me), but that was my own doing, not a defect. Once I figured it out, it was easy peasy!

Awesome! Having any hoist is great, as you can do repairs you otherwise wouldnt take on, and see things you otherwise wouldve missed. Having a hoist that fits in a garage with a low ceiling height is even better! I put off certain maintenance items for months so I could instead carry them out using a hoist. After many hours of research, hundreds of measurements, and many hours getting the installation just right (getting the concrete remedied that was too thin was a bit tricky, but well worth the wait), this hoist is a perfect fit for my garage. The ability to run it off 120V is great and the option to get a 240V relay to run it off 240V is also great.

Key Fob works alright but programming instructions were not accurate. Attached is a picture of what it shows on the site. The diagram above the black line shows the instructions I was given. "Connect cavity G with cavity A using a fused jumper wire. The vehicle will respond by locking and unlocking the door locks within 2 seconds. Press any button 3 times in succession on first remote to be programmed. Locks will lock and unlock verifying remote was programmed. Press any button 3 times in succession on second remote to be programmed if applicable. Locks will lock and unlock to verify remote was programmed." When that didn't work I called their tech department and waited for a call back. When I was called, I was told to cycle the ignition 3 times and that would program it. When it didn't work the tech told me i had to contact a dealer or a locksmith to have it programmed. The Diagram below the black line shows the 2 terminals I had to jumper to get it to program. Programming won't work with any of the doors open so make sure you're inside and the doors are closed before trying. Then HOLD the lock or unlock button for 15 to 30 seconds to program. Overall the product is good but the instructions are inaccurate.(Update) I was contacted by Your Keyless Remote and discussed the programming Hassle. they reviewed my case and issued a partial refund for my hassle. Again remote is continuing to work so product is still Fantastic

Always loved this phrase and tend to utilize often. Haha. It's pretty small which was a little disappointing but take a guess at who didn't read the size before purchasing?  I put one on my rear windshield and has held up quite well, seems to be a quality sticker that makes me giggle.

I have long since learned that I absolutely need to have a sun shade in my car to keep the inside tolerable (I have black leather interior which makes it extra hot).I love this set as it includes two smaller shades for rear passengers they can use even while I am driving.  While my windows are all tinted, at times rear passengers just need to have a little more protection than just my tinted windows.  The front pop up shade is incredibly easy to install and stays securely in place.  I tried it in all 5 of our cars, and it works equally well in all of them.As a sun reflector this product is great. It is easy to set up in my car, and effectively reflects any sunlight from the front windshield making it such that my car is much cooler when I get in. It also protects my dash board. For me the true test of these kind of products is not how fast I can set it up, but rather how fast can I put it away again after I am done.  To my surprise even putting it back into the little pouch after I removed it was also a breeze. It is flexible and easily goes back into a shape where you can stuff it back where it belongs.DISCLOSURE : Product received to test at no cost to me with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned. I reserve 4 and 5 star ratings for products I would either recommend to others or buy for myself. This is a great product that I would highly recommend!

Safe (reasonably), effective, reasonably priced.  Made the job pretty easy on my M3.I recommend a small electric impact (like the ones you use to drive in screws) to spin the threaded rods on this.  Just lube up the threads and alternate sides every inch or so.  You can also use it to remove the old strut top nut.They say not to use an impact to install the new top nut on the new strut, but I held the shaft to prevent it from spinning and used the same small low torque impact to install the new nut.  You can then check the torque using an Allen wrench and spark plug socket.  (Allen wrench goes down through the center of the socket to hold the strut shaft, while you use a wrench on the hex of the spark plug socket).Anyway, changing struts is an easy job with this tool, but make sure you have a good torque wrench and thread locker to re-attach your suspension components to the new strut.

I like the bed extender a lot.  We went from having a car to our first truck and by not having a trunk we had to find a different solution. The bed extender along with a tonneau cover gives you back that covered space.  It doesn't interfere with he tonneau cover at all.  It was very easy to put on and adjust. All components are lightweight but sturdy.  Definitely would recommend it!

I used this for a replacement battery for a Power Wheels Hurricane Jeep with the orange top battery.  This battery is larger and I had to trim about 1/4" of plastic in the battery compartment.  I used a 90 degree air die grinder with a cutoff wheel to trim the plastic.  Went like butter.  If you don't have air tools, use a Dremmel or go old school and use a hacksaw blade.I also used the wiring from the old orange top battery.  You have to pry that cover off the to expose the leads.  Pull the wires out as much as you can, then clip them. One wire will be longer than the other, trim them even.  You only get one chance.  It is very easy.  The last step is to crimp on the new female tab terminals to the wires you just removed.  Any standard female wire terminal tab will work.  Any auto store will have them.  Make sure to buy the yellow connectors for meant for 12-10 AWG (American Wire Gauge is the wire gauge size).  Strip the wire you cut from the old battery about 1/4" back and insert it into the tab.  There should be just a tiny bit of wire protruding from the end of the front of the tab with the yellow sleeve covering the insulation.  Do not leave exposed wire sticking out the back.  Crimp the terminal on tight using a standard automotive style crimp tool.It works perfectly.  Kids got about 3-4 hours run time out of it.  I charged the battery x-mas night and today is the first time that is needs recharged.  Much better than the $70-80 Power Wheel battery.  Don't be afraid of having to do a little modification.  It literally took me ten minutes altogether.I will try to post some pics later.  Good Luck.UPDATE:  Feb 27, 2018  Added the pictures.  Battery still runs like a champ.  Hardly ever have to recharge it as it lasts/holds a charge for a long time. Kids will play with the vehicle for an hour and it does not need to be recharged the same day.  As a side note, I always disconnect the battery plug when I store it.  You never know if there is a slow drain in the system somewhere and it is just good practice to help maintain batteries.  I do the same thing for cars if I don't drive them often.

Purchased these front rotors for my 06 Toyota Corolla in November 2016.  They started showing rust quickly within about the first 2 weeks of having them. It also might be the New England weather we get here as well with freezing temperatures and lots of snow.Ive been driving with them for almost 19,000 miles (I drive a lot for work), and they have not affected my brakes at all.Although I recently had issues with my calipers piston seizing.  (Picture shown is what they look like now). Technicians usually recommend replacing all rotors, brake pads, and the whole nine yrds if you're replacing one of the calipers, but I bring it to my own mechanic who is very honest and charges me at a reasonable price for repairs.  I was able to save these 2 yr old rotors and dished out only $100 on replacement calipers and pads including labor.  Anyway, Im hoping these rotors last me until this car reaches at least 300,000 Miles! Ill update when they become an issue.

I heard bad things about the Bosch sensors.  And Amazon has a killer price on this Denso sensor!  In my 2000 Pontiac Grand Prix GT 3.8L V6, the front O2 sensor is used to monitor the fuel mixture and affects gas mileage, while the rear (post cat) sensor is only used to monitor catalytic converter emissions quality.  So I put the cheapest one I could find in the rear, and this good Denso up front.  Great!

I decided to change the motor after going through the 3 phases of a dying starter motor, the slow (wau-wau noise), then the tic-tac solenoid noise, and finally the banging with a wrench for it to start.I changed the starter motor on a 4X4 2002 Chevy Tahoe Z71, and believe me it is not an easy task. On the 4X4 the front axle reduces the clearance to a minimum.Seriously the clearance is almost none, the shop manual calls for the removal of one of the bolts that hold the axel to the frame / chassis; and that was the only thing that I was not willing to do, I didn't want to get involved in realigning holes to reinstall a bolt that holds the front axle.So persistence and playing with space as little as 1/8 of an inch and prying it with a large screw driver allow it me to pull it down. The older original factory starter motor has two outside bolts, which made it even more difficult to pull down the motor.The new motor does not have the outside bolts, but pushing up the motor to slide it in location was not an easy task, it was an issue of a tiny bit here and there ( with the corresponding  tic-tac noises) pushing it really hard to get into position. If you are going to replace a starter motor in a similar Tahoe 4X4, I highly recommend you to lift the front of the car, and get a cradle wheeled car to do this job ( make sure your kids are not around, because you are going to course like never before).I have replaced the fuel pump in this SUV (which means removing the fuel tank), I have replaced the A/C compressor, and I can tell you that both jobs were a breeze compared to removing and installing the starter motor.I am sure that for those that own the RWD version of the same vehicle, removing and reinstalling the starter motor has not been a problem.Once installed, I started the engine. Fortunately the starter work and there were not issues. But for this specific installation on a 4X4, I highly recommend you to test the starter motor outside before proceeding with the installation.I got lucky, and I know the starters are tested at factory before shipping; but what about if after all of that work the new one would it prove defective? Not only that, to return it, the motor got all scratched during the installation.The starter came with what suppose to be a longer bolt, in my case both older bolts were the same length as the new one that came with the starter. The new starter has the same dimensions as the older one, except it does not have the 2 outside bolts and brackets.Remember to always remove first the small signal cable from the solenoid, and its the last to be attached after the thick battery cable, if the starter slides from your hands while installing it, you don't want the small cable to be the one to hold the weight of the starter.Since I did not have any issues with the new starter, and after 30 days it still working with no problems, I give it a 5 stars rating.Below pictures of the old and the new starterIf you like the review, give me thumps in Amazon, do you have any questions? let me know.

We own 2 Honda Fits in the family, a 2007 Honda Fit Sport and a 2015 Honda Fit EX-L.We love dogs but also love our cars, and since we love our dogs more than our cars, we always thought that we'll always be slightly unhappy. After all, it takes us a hour to clean each car after letting our dogs in on one. We tried the fabric covers but they don't help at all, since the dog hairs still stick to it unless we clean it off, wasting a lot of time.And then, we got these covers! They are not expensive if you thing about it, since we almost paid an extra $3,000 to get the leather seats. They are even BETTER than the leather seats, since the dogs will eventually scratch up or even break the leather seats. The $50 covers would last us more than a year, and it won't cost so much to replace.

Did my oil change (Total 5W-40) recently on my 2012 R8 V8, and, with the advise from theR8 forum, it was a breeze for the mechanical aspects.Unfortunately, my service light icon stayed on and despite the different methods suggested on the site, there was no way it could be reset from within the vehicle. This was confirmed by the local Audi Service Manager who was charging $175 to have it done.Luckily, a friend of mine has a 2011 S5 and does his own fluid changes and manages the reset with his Foxwell Scan Tool. It cost him $150 plus another $70 for the Audi programming. Great, but I wanted to see what other more affordable equipment was available.Finally settled on the Vgate VS450 from Ebay for $35. Reviews on You Tube seemed fairly positive and wouldn't break anyone's wallet given the expense. Worst case is too borrow the Foxwell.Item arrived today (from China) one week after ordering online.Plugged into the OBD port and got the menu. Clicked on SERVICE Reset, then VW/Audi, then ALL. Since my R8 sees about 2k/yr. I first scrolled to get a longer interval - Long Life oil (15k and 720 days). Once done, went back to oil reset and it was done (with an on-screen confirmation plus the Service Icon disappeared).If your like me, who have seen techs, sometimes, not do a great job with simple oil changes (e.g. put all the clips back, proper torque values on all the bolts, put protective cover on bodywork, etc.......), I have enough free time and all the tools to do it "right". The Vgate has now paid for itself 5 fold compared to a service appt. in this one use. Certainly a good feeling!!!Will update after one yesr!

Do not waste you money on this flawed design.  You cannot unscrew the cast aluminum water separator / sediment bowl from the filter when you remove the disposable fuel filter.  The factory separator / sediment bowl screws onto the bottom of the filter.  I had bought two and installed one last June (2016).  I wanted to change it out again in April of 2017.  Removing the disposable filter first disconnecting the plug that signals water in the fuel fuel on the dash.  It also has a drain valve.  Both are attached to the $75 factory semiretired bowl. Removing this or any disposable filter requires  requires a oil filter wrench. the problem lies with plastic threaded bottom piece in the filter that mates with sediment bowl.  It bonds itself to the sediment bowl and the only way to get the factory separator / sediment bowl off is cut the FRAM filter apart using a cutoff wheel and Aviation snips.  You don't want to damage the factory separator.I ordered spare Wix fuel filters which have a positive lock to prevent the plastic threaded base from rotating when installing or removing the sediment bowl.  Below are pictures of the cut up FRAM filter.OK, but the last one I used had the threaded plastic base the separator threads on to fail to stay in position on the sheet metal canister.  It would simply spin.  That is, the metal separator could not be unthreaded from the disposable filter.  I had to bandsaw the filter in half, cut back the sheet metal and the use a wood chisel to carefully remove the plastic threaded base to free up the cast metal separator (aka Fuel Filter Bowl and Drain Assembly / sediment bowl) so it can be re-used on the new filter.  The Ford engine Fuel Filter Bowl & Drain Assembly / sediment bowl is an eye popping $75 if it needs replacement due to damaging it when replacing a fuel filter.

This thing is a game changer.  I did not even realize the red phone button allows you to talk to Siri; so I'm reading and replying to texts on the highway!  It also rocks if you need GPS directions in your ear.  So far is has been super reliable with zero issues.As far as sound quality goes......it all depends on your engine/wind background noise.  On the highway, the music volume struggles a bit, but other than that it is as loud as you want it to be considering the speakers are so close to your ears.

I made extra copies of the template in case i messed them up but didn't use them.  There are a few videos on youtube on how to install these kits.  I installed it on my EZGO 48v and replaced the on/off switch it came with because I wanted to a different kind and not the cheesy pull/push nob for the lights.

garbage. Where the throttle body connect to the sensor that is shown above has a plastic ring that connect to the throttle body, it WILL BREAK!! I sent it back to amazon. This is not a good fit part. You will have High RPM and Horrible acceleration. don't buy this one, you will see at the bottom of the pic, that the plastic caved in to the sensor. Which will make it ineffective. Buy OEM or Duralast not this one, if you look at the bottom of the pic, you will see what it looks like after 5 starts. the center connection will break against the throttle body.

I just installed this on my modular helmet, was easy to install and comes with everything you need including strips of tape, wire ties, hook & loop tape and pockets for the speakers (with hook & loop on them).After a short ride I can say the sound was great even when I turned the volume way up louder then I would ever normally have it.  Haven't heard the mic quality, but if it is anything like the speakers I will be happy.Edit: Less then a year later I also had the wires break or short out and am down to one ear.  Seems to be in the bundle of wires that come out of the helmet, this is due to the way I installed it into the helmet.  Don't let the plug dangle from the wire out of the helmet, attach the plastic molded plug directly to the helmet.  To be clear the coiled cord should be able to be unplugged from the helmet with tension on the cord for crash safety so only attach the helmet side of the plug.

It's a great rack if you throw out the turn knob hardware that comes with it to attach to the rain gutters. The hardware used to space out the bars enough is fine but the hardware to tighten it down to the roof is s***. It spins on itself because there is nothing to keep friction between the two plastic pieces (see picture). I went to hardware store and spent $3 for new galvanized  bolts that were shorter and some lock nuts. It was worth it to get new hardware that will not rust. No it doesn't lock but it's also not going to rust on me or fall off or get stuck because of cheap plastic s***. Overall happy with purchase just disappointed in hardware, which has already been mentioned by many other customers in reviews.

These wiper blades are 3/4" wide and have a full-length, curved steel backplate enclosed in a three-part rubber and plastic housing. The housing comprises a plastic middle part with a built-in adaptor for the wiper arm of your vehicle, and two heavy-duty, sheath-like rubber covers spanning both ends of the blade. It is a frameless design in which the blade is not framed by any articulated parts in the housing but instead it is allowed to flex freely as it guides across a curved windshield. Most wiper blades use an articulated rigid frame that could possibly limit the maximum curvature of the blade.The rubber blade tip appears to be a regular rubber with no special coating or sheen to it. There is a milky, plastic V-shaped cover running the entire length of the blade for protection. A yellow circular label on it warns that it must be removed after installation. It's interesting that the manufacturer ships these blades with a cover to protect their edge. I haven't seen such a cover on other wiper blades, even the expensive ones.The wiper blades are packaged in a fully recyclable, frustration-free cardboard box. The plastic adaptor on the wiper blade is designed to fit a wide variety of wiper arms. An instruction sheet is provided to show you how to install them on your particular vehicle.I'm quite pleased with the performance of these wiper blades. They guide smoothly across the windshield without skipping a bit. They are quiet and don't leave any streaks on the windshield. Although they are basic, no-frills blades, they work very well. For the price, they are an excellent choice for a pair of replacement blades.

What more do you need to know? Half the price of OEM from Nissan, I would swear they are exactly the same (probably same factory), fit and finish is perfect and it took me approximately 5 minutes to install on our 17 Rogue. Just make sure you put down a blanket or sheet when installing so that you don't scratch your roof. Great product!

(IF YOU DON'T LIKE FUNNY STORIES THEN SKIP TO THE LAST PARAGRAPH)I live in an area densely populated with vampires, which makes leisurely rides at night rather difficult. I'm constantly under attack by these foul beasts but have always been lucky enough to own a motorcycle faster than any creature of the skies. Unfortunately for me, my stock halogen bulbs have never been bright enough to ward these wretches away.One night after another close encounter, I decided I wanted something that could help me see the crowded skies much clearer. After several hours of shopping and researching, good reviews and detailed pictures made me discover that the Kensun HID might be an alternative to my problem. I purchased and received these new vampire-repelents thanks to Amazon's nifty "Prime" program, and got right to work into outfitting my motorcycle for battle. Once installed, I waited for night to close in.As the moon rose into the sky, I knew it was time. I geared up, and took off into the late night, knowing this could be my last ride if these lights failed me. My low beam however lit the road up like it was day, which gave me hope for what was to come. About 10 minutes into my journey, I noticed movement ahead of me. Two vampires waiting in the road to spring an unruly trap and ensnare their helpless victim! I lowered my body and pulled back on the throttle to gain speed. This was it, the moment of truth. About 100 yards before I reached their position, I flipped on my high beam, igniting the fire within the second bulb. To my astonishment, the vampires did not, flinch, fall, run, or fly away. The daylight I now wielded within my hands disintegrated, that's right, DISINTEGRATED the vampires before my very eyes.It did not end there, all through the night, vampire after vampire fell to the sheer power that is Kensun (vampires aren't that smart you know). I was no longer a young motorcyclist trying to find my place in the world, I had created and accepted my destiny; a vampire slayer.  Not only am I safe, but I can now protect those around me from the beasts that mean to do us all harm. And I owe it all to Kensun for making such remarkable aftermarket HIDs.Now that my tale is over, let me shift gears and get to the review. I've always been skeptical about HIDs but the fact that this product had over 2500 reviews at 4.5 out of 5 stars made up my mind for me. I ordered the 6000k color temp which came in promptly. Install was a breeze, and very simple, a true plug-and-play. When I fired up my bike after the install (2009 Kawasaki ZX6R), the lights came right on with no flickering. It takes them about 15 seconds to warm up completely, and when they did it made my garage look like the door was up and the sunlight was shining in. So I rolled it outside to see how they look and they are incredibly bright and noticeable, so noticeable in fact that it will illuminate the road signs all around you in broad daylight. Night time is just as good, the road before me is always well lit, and when I hit the high beam I swear it lights up the landscape ALL around me for hundreds of feet. I bought them to do exactly what I wanted them to do and that was to make my riding at night much safer (and to kill those nasty vampires ;p ). As for color, 6000k (they make all ranges of color temps) is true white with a slight slight slight tint of blue. The color tone is so clean and crisp and gives my bike such a modern advanced look, which is also what I was going for.All in all, VERY pleased with what I received, especially for the price. I've already been recommending to my other riding buddies. Invest in a pair!!!

I had my doubts - especially at the sub $200 price point but I have to admit this was a pleasure to install, everything was spot on and high quality and I was very impressed.The other xPOD alternatives in the market are $500+ so when I read on the Wrangler Forum that several people were having good luck with this distribution system I was compelled to try it. With Amazon's excellent return policy I figured I had nothing to lose.  I was more than impressed with the build quality and the materials that are used for this device. Everything is aluminum/metal - no plastic (except for toggle switch plates of course)I installed this in my 2017 Wrangler JKU Rubicon at night in the garage with the help of my 13 YO daughter in just over an hour - we would have been done sooner had we not needed to fight reassembly of our grab handles and A Pillar - that is not ApolloIntech's issue.I love the resetable circuit breaker. The wiring is high quality, the system is truly plug and play.  Our biggest issues was where to get the wire into the fusebox to tap the M6 fuse and where on the firewall to mount the 100 amp circuit breaker.  I drilled a small hole into the passenger side of the fuse box and threaded the red wire through the fuse box.  I plan on sealing the hole with some high temp sealant to be sure to keep elements out.They even included wiring spades for attaching accessories to the distribution panel - no need for additional parts here.Time will tell how it hold up to the heat and cold of NJ weather but the install was flawless and it appears to be as good as if not better than the $500+ solutions in the market.Bravo ApolloInTech team.

Everything seems great.  I would say either go with this tire, the Shinko 009 (good tire, dumb name), or if you want longer life/less traction the ME880.  Don't spend big bucks on a better sport-touring tire unless you have money to throw away.

Everything you change on a Jeep will require three other things to be changed as well.  The new front bumper was put on at the end of December and now it is time for the matching rear bumper. Why a new rear bumper when the old one was just fine? Simple the rear bumper is one of the three thing to follow the new tires. A bigger or oversize tire on a stock tail gate will over time destroy the hinges and latches on your tailgate. The solution was a swing out tire carrier. That required a heavy duty bumper to mount the carrier. My wife recommended this, never argue with you wife when she says buy Jeep parts.  Happy now? There were cheaper bumpers and more expensive bumpers, I went with a mid range price. I did want D-Rings and an adjustable spare mount.  E-Autogrilles was my choice. I did have some issues with the holes on the front bumper not lining up but, for the rear bumper it turns out it lined up correctly. The shipping was VERY fast, even with ordering on a Saturday. It arrived via UPS on Wednesday. There were two boxes, one large square for the bumper and a second for the tire carrier. With the seat moved forward they fit in the Jeep. I did most of the install myself, the only part that required assistance was lifting the bumper and putting in the bolts. A little lifting to get them all lined up and after the 8 rear bolts were tightened the lower bolts under the frame lined up. (The two under frame bolts were NOT included.) Overall it looks good and I am happy thus far. Time will tell of how good the powder coat is.  Thank you E-Autogrilles for quick service.  A full review with instruction on the blog 1995wrangler.com

These are really bright lights and great for the price. I bought these to install on my car under the hood. I had hem since October and still work great. Doesn't have any leds dead at all from the motor heat. I do recommend changing the tape to 3m weather heavy duty tape. The original came off after a few days, the 3m is still on there, no issues. I did this in two cars, No Issues so far.

Holy crap!!!! These babies are the brightest led's bulbs known to man. JDM ASTAR never ceases to amaze me. I have had many of their led's and will continue to buy only that brand and these are the brightest. I installed these in my 95 Yukon while replacing the yellow sun faded lens. And between the new lens and these bad boys I have a extra set of headlights. So now I have 3 settings lol most have 2 settings. Low beam and high beam, well with these what would have been "parking" Amber lights the white running lights are defently low beam worthy. So I have LOW beam "running lights" then MED being my actual stock low beam then stick HIGH beam. Buy these and rest assure they will NOT disappoint.

This kit is great value but do NOT use the pilot bearing or throwout bearing. They're total crap and will fail on you. I bought Timken pilot bearing and throwout bearing.The clutch disk and pressure plate is made in Japan. The pilot bearing and throwout bearing is made in China crap.Resurface your flywheel and proceed to do 500 miles of city driving (stop and go) and you will have a long lasting clutch setup.

This little guy is great. We use it as the sole power source on our vintage RV when we are off the grid. Its small so it fits nicely and hidden under the table and make it easy to pull it out if I need to get to it thought it is certainly heavy.POWERWe don't use a lot of power, the RV has three 6W LED lights in the cabin that light up the entire interior [...] (23ft pull behind trailer). We use the lights for a few hours each night and can go for over 3 days running off this battery. Occasionally we'll have a macbook running off the battery as well and found that I can get 2-3 full charges plus a 1-3 days of those 6W lights in the evening. So typically we have a macbook running for several hours during the day while I work and the 6W LEDs at night (using only the ones we need) and we can go off grid for about 2-3 days with this little battery.CHARGINGI charge the battery any time we are on the grid using this very simple trickle charger [...] If we are going to be off the grid for several days then I take the battery to Autozone after it dies (about 2 days of use) and have them charge it during the day so its ready at night and will last 2 more days. It does need many hours to charge - 12 hours is idealCONVERSIONFinally, we use a Pure Sine inverter to convert the power from the battery to the RV [...] We use Pure Sine which is the more expensive type of inverter because its safer for computers. The inverter connects to the battery with two battery terminals, then the RV plugs into the inverterOVERALLIve been very happy with this little battery. It lasts as long as we require though I will likely get a second one to extend our off grid time. The only downside is that it take a long time to charge, but that was expected.

Was sitting on this for a while, kind of hesitant about aftermarket products.  I have only had this on for 2 days, and didn't disappoint.  Lighting is great, the color was great.  We'll see how long this will last.  I did not need the adapter ring, just swapped out the light with my halogen.  For less than $100, can't be beat.

Let's be honest, when you buy a color temp, you don't know what you're getting. There is zero consistency amongst manufacturers.  In my picture of the garage wall the left/driver's side is 6000k and the right/passenger's side is 5000k. As others have mentioned, the 5000k is closer to pink than white. Just wanted to share my experience and give you the ability to choose what you want. The picture showing my car's front end is the 6000k lights on both sides, perfect.

These are really nice lights for the price.  Actually, they are perfect.  Very happy with the color and brightness in my application.  Have a 97 Jeep Grand Cherokee that had 5 bulbs on the liner and wanted to get something that didn't suck so much power.  The best part is these aren't that aggressive blueish white color.  Great fit and seem well built.

Fits the 2017 F150 XLT Crew cab perfectly. Secured by two thumb screw that replace existing 8mm Bolts per supplied instructions. when installed the seats do NOT lock in the down position but this is because the latches to release the seat are underneath and not accessible. Even though they do not lock in the down position anything you are storing is covered and out of sight by the seats. Capable of storing two shotguns and a scoped long rifle. This is a huge improvement from previous years that only held rifles or shotguns without scopes. While in storage with the seat down the scoped rifle has plenty of clearance which is a huge relief, adds piece of mind that it won't get banged up and lose its zero.

This product really looks good. I ordered from a cheap phone and could not tell it has a "micro vent pattern" I don't know how else to describe the texture, however, it gives it a modern look. Kinda classic Euro look when Europe made cool cars.  Its comfortable, attractive, and looks stock. It was covering the edge of my steering wheel controls so I used the "micro vent pattern" as a guide and ripped out the foam backing with my fingers and cut the leather with my pocket knife and it still looks great. So if you suck at stuff like I do, it will still look great! Also it took me perhaps 25 min to install. My blazing install speed could be attributed to the fact I took Home Econ in high school 20 years ago, but I found it very easy to install, and as I said, I suck at stuff like this.

I have a black '09 Infiniti G37 - the paint had lost it's depth and was all swirl marks in the sun.  I used a Meguiar's DFP6 6" DA Foam Polishing Disc and purchased a dual action orbital buffer from Harbor Freight.  It took nearly 6 hours to do the entire car but the results were well worth it.  The paint reflection now looks like a mirror.  I buffed the car over a month ago and it still looks great after several washes.  I'll probably continue to buff the car yearly using Meguiar's mirror glaze - if you put in the work, you will be very happy with the results!

I bought these to put into my wife's 2014 CRV I really liked them they were a little bit brighter and the light was more white.Last week 2/15/2016 the passenger side bulb burned out!  It has only been 5 months!  To be honest I wasn't really mad about the fact that the bulb burned out, since high output bulbs are known to have a shorter life.  What really ticked me off was that the bulb exploded in the headlight housing!  And no I did not touch the bulb!  I'm an ASE certified technician and I have replaced plenty of bulbs in my career.  Hopefully I can remove the headlight and get most of the debris out....Today 2/27/2016 the drivers side went out too!

Ordered for my 2014 Base Tacoma (V6 4x4 double cab).The install was fairly straight forward. Loosen a few bolts, and remove the others. I had my girlfriend help to hold the hitch while I installed it, and generally make sure the bumper did not fall. I was able to do all the work from the ground. Even without dropping the tire. Just be sure the hitch is flush with the frame and bumper.You will need a 17mm & 19mm socket, along with a ratchet, extender, and torque wrench. Also be sure to buy a cover, as it does not come with one.

*** NOT A PAID REVIEW ***Bottom Line:  Great OrganizerThis is a review of the Rola Trunk Organizer.  I bought this to help organize my trunk and to keep things from rolling around in the back.  The item arrived relatively quickly and performed as expected.  It was a little smaller than what I was expecting but didn't turn out to be a big deal breaker for what I needed.  The build quality was nice and the extra weight helps to keep this from sliding around.  Now my trunk is more organized and I have a few less things rolling around.  There are cheaper alternatives but you definitely won't go wrong with this product.Cons:- a little expensivePros:- decent quality- durable so far- great fit

This does not fit all years from 2000 to 2006, it fits 2000 to 2003, there is a two inch change in the Jeep side to side and front to back. The spanner bow does not take up the slack so at 45mph it sounds like the top is going to fly away. If your Jeep is 2004-2006 this is not the one for you, Oh here is the kicker, Best top knows about this, they do make the OEM top, but since MOPAR owns the rights to that top this is not the top made to those dimensions a little sleezy if you ask me. If you need a top go to the dealer, or better yet go find a hard top on craigslist they are still out there.

I was a little nervous thinking about buying these lights given the cost. I mean, for 4 lights, less than $10/light seemed ... not right. Especially for LED and what others charge.I have yet to hook up all 4 to my Jeep at once and can update this review when I do. But I did take just one, and at night hooked it up and aimed it down both sides of the private road I live on. I was shocked at the amount of light that comes out of these. I can't imagine what all 4 on at one time would be like. I may wire them in pairs just in case I'm not trying to blind someone for life.. hahaha

While this technically does fit under the seat, there is no way to get a wrench in to tighten it to the floor.  The seat brackets completely block access to the bolts.  This is with factory seats that do not tilt forward.  The build quality of the box is fine but it is impossible to install without the aid of a cutting torch or angle grinder.  Very dissatisfied with my purchase.

I installed it about two weeks ago, i uploaded some pictures to this product's page. The set includes the grease you need to apply to the trans shaft splines, TOB and clutch fork. It comes in a big sealed EXEDY box, inside you will find the clutch disc, presure plate and TOB in their own boxes and some instructions. Now, after 400 - 600 miles the clutch got its proper catch, my 91 accord can burn tires when shifting to third. I did the job myself so i'm very pleased with the price and quality, i definitely recommend this clutch if you want an OEM type clutch.

Fit is excellent and the quality is outstanding.  These are thick molded rubber - not hard plastic like the Weather techs.  Only issue for some is that the lip fits over the door sill and covers that logo plate.  Not a problem for me - I like that - but could be a problem for some.I chose these over the factory GM liners and am very glad that I did!

I was converting all my car lights from bulbs to LEDs as they are way brighter and consume less energy which makes it easier on the engine. I purchased SAWE - 31MM 6-SMD 5050 Festoon Dome Map Interior LED Light Bulbs Lamp DE3175 DE3022 DE3021 3024. The bulbs came well packaged in a nice small box and on time. Each bulb is solidly built. It has 6 LEDs and fits the interior housing without any issues. The LED is about the size of original light and I had no problem installing them. After the installation, the light output is way brighter (see 2 images comparison). It is more modern since it is more of a white color without yellow hint. The check engine light never came on after the installation suggesting it does not interfere with anything else in the car. I am really glad I made the switch and planning to change lights in my parents' cars also.I would like to disclose that I did receive this product at a discounted price for the unbiased and honest opinion and was not compensated in any other way.

This is a great light bar and we highly recommend it overall. A couple quick tips and things we learned about installing it:Definitely run the wiring down from the light bar on the battery side of your vehicle. With the Bluetooth pack and the wiring harness having to connect to each other it shortens the length of the wiring. This will allow you to then only have to run the switches to wherever you need. Those have plenty of wiring. This was specific to our Jeep Wrangler JK though so your experience may be a bit different. In our case its easier to drop the wires from the light bar on the passenger side.Everything is super easy to install, comes with universal mounts if you don't already have your own for your vehicle also.We added door trim on both ends of the light bar to help with the dreaded light bar hum and it helped 100%. Doesn't effect the bar and keeps it quiet.A tight seal, great functions, easy install, bright light and multiple modes make this a no brainer. Much better than the cheap light bars we have ran in the past and a great price point.

My son bought me Darth Vader and stormtrooper decals for my minivan windows.  Best Christmas present ever.  They were easy to apply on the outside of the windows without leaving huge bubbles.  I made a mistake with the stormtrooper, but it was simple enough to peel off and start again.  Now that they've been on awhile, they are harder to get off.  I tried peeling a little edge just to see if I could get it off as easily as I did when it was fresh.  It was stuck on good, but I did not try very hard to take it off, because I don't want it to come off.I have had so many positive comments on these decals, especially the stormtrooper, which shows up better on tinted windows.  The only caveat I have for Vader is he goes on the on the driver's side windows.  If you put him on the passengers' side, he'll be facing backwards.

I bought these at first to replace the exterior parking light, and it looks really cool, but it was 6000k color so it clashed with my headlights, and I don't want to change my headlight bulbs to match the color, so instead I switched them to the license plate area and they look great there. I did not take a picture of it since the car was dirty but here is how they look in the front. The right side is Philips, the left side is stock.

This kit is perfect! All parts Japan (belt USA). All parts matched originals in my impreza. Dont buy anything else. Gates has chinese parts. This is the OEM kit for less than buying part by part. Will buy again if can get to 210,000 miles. Aisin is my new go to for timing kits on Subaru. Maybe will get crankshaft pulley bult removal/install tool as to make removing 22mm bolt a bit easier, or make something up. Also, lines on belt make install dummy proof. If this fits your Subaru and your doing your timing and water pump... Get it!

I installed this light on the grille guard on a 2001 Ford Escape. It is better built than the $200 lights I've seen in stores. It's been on my car for several months. No rust and no water in the lens. It is so bright. I've never seen a brighter light. Make the headlights look dim.  People ask where I got it almost daily. If your looking for a quality ,bright light this is it. Would recommend to everyone.

Not great for my 2018 4Runner.  After installing these, I noticed one beam was not nearly as concentrated as the other.  When I attempted to swap the bulbs around to verify a bad unit I found I can't get the driver's side bulb out.  The aluminum heat sink is so large it has wedged itself against a piece of the housing and getting it out by hand it not an option. The picture shows a gusset, running left to right in red, on the housing that is wedged in one of the large gaps on the heat sink.  The bulb won't turn left or right now.  I'm afraid I'll have to use pliers or something which I'm sure will void any warranty/replacement these might have come with.  They may be good bulbs but if they aren't easily replaceable then what's the point?Update 7/17/18.  Their customer service has contacted me and wants to do what they can to make my experience with Auxbeam a positive one.  Its nice to see companies stand behind their products and customer satisfaction!  They have another model that Ill try to see if its a better fit.  Look out for that review once Ive received the product.

I had the famous service 4wd message.I started by swapping the dash switch.  While that got me a new switch with lights that worked, it don't solve the problem.This part did.  No more random shifting, no more inability to shift, no problems.  Its nice to have my truck behave.If you can swap the encoder motor, you can change this.  Dropping the front driveshaft was easy.  Index the shaft, mark everything so you can line it back up and drop it.  It will take longer to remove and reinstall the encoder motor than to replace this part.Pull the encoder motor.  All of this is available on YouTube to watch.  Dont overtighten the torx screws, I broke one and had to drill and tap it.One last piece of advice.  I use loctite on u-join bolts and then torque them to spec.  Cheap insurance.Overall Im very pleased.  I should have done this a year ago.

The quality of the deflector itself is top notch, the mounting hardware is a tiny bit sketchy. I didn't trust the hardware that they provided to attach the deflector to the 100% so I made a few modifications. Great item though all in all and I'd buy it again!

The head lights are for the most part really awesome , they're bright n definitely work the reason I'm giving 4 starts though is because the instructions didn't say how to connect the head lights to the turning signal so my DRL don't work nor do he amber turn signal lights work, and I couldn't find a video oh how to properly do it,( eventually came across the right video, n got everything to work which is awesome)

This is the first of two inverters that I have planned for our off grid camper trailer. For the moment everything is still in test phase and only temporarily installed but it was able to power the battery chargers for my power tools and did power up the air conditioner in the camper, how ever it did go into alarm mode once the condenser kicked on and then I lost all power.  It was getting late so I was not able to find out why it did that.  This is hooked up a battery bank of 3 marine deep cell batteries being charged by solar power. As of right now the solar power is only a 200w system that is going to be upgraded to 600w and possibly a wind generator as well as finances allow. I'll keep updating this as the trailer comes together more... FIRST UPDATE: I've now installed 2 more 100 watt solar panels and doubled my charging power. I've been testing the system with a variety of loads and for several different time spans. As the Go Power! team pointed out to me in a comment (posted below) this is not a very good power supply to power up the air conditioner although it will hold the unit for about an hour of use before it shut itself down. This was with a fairly steady 1500 watt load. I'm very pleased that it can power the AC unit for short term use and even more pleased that it will automatically drop the load to protect my batteries from damage.  As of right now I can power all of my tools (chop saw, angle grinder, battery chargers for drill, sawsall, vacuum) with no power supply problems. Stay tuned... More to come!

I used this product to install a double DIN JVC player in a 1997 Mazda B2300. It worked very well for me. It was easy to assemble, and once the lip of the truck radio panel (from the dash) was trimmed to allow a double din radio to slide in (very easily accomplished with dremel or razor blade), it held the radio in very tightly. The kit appeared flimsy at first glance, but the key was getting the right and left panels on the correct side, and make sure they are properly screwed into the radio chassis, while at the same time pressed into the original radio panel (the part of the dash board that holds factory radio). The trim piece that comes with the kit hides any gap quite well. After the radio and dash panel were assembled in the dash, it was all very steady and tight. Make sure you have the proper radio removal tool (u shaped wire) before beginning. I was pleased with this kit.

After reading all these reviews I wanna give a real input to someone that is going to get this for their D17 Honda civic. This is not a turbo this is a breather for your car. It will be louder and sound more aggressive. I have had mine for 2 years now there is no breaking in so long as you install correctly make sure you clamps are secure. It is about a 5hp gain that is it however it will accelerate SLIGHTLY faster then before. It will give you a few more miles to the gallon if your not like me and have a heavy foot. This was my first aftermarket part and I don't regret it. Just be sure to clean the filter once every 6 months

Bad luck. The price decreased to $99 after I bought it was $129.99 I did check on OSRAM TRUST website about these bulbs I purchased, And the OSRAM web provided me with the serial number for each bulbs, and there was different serial number for each bulbs and it was the same as my bulbs.So I think it's genuine osram bulbs form Authorized Seller. Check the picture...Didn't try it yet because I am very busy.Bet there is a lot if review everywhere about it.So no need of it i think.Just I want to conform it is genuine bulbs form Authorized Seller.

Install was straightforward enough.  I was disappointed in the quality of the paint job on the smaller set of nuts.  A flake or something like it was sticking out and it was very sharp.  If i hadnt been careful, this coukd have been a bloody install too.  No instructions were included, but youtube is my friend.  2016 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sport

This pump DOES NOT fit a 2001 Kia Sephia.  the Amazon compatibility check failed.  It clearly indicates that this is a replacement part for the Sephia washer pump.  The housing of the pump looks exactly the same as the original.  What is totally different is the electrical connection.  On the OEM part I am replacing, the watertight electrical plug looks like a plastic "B" with one narrow metal spade terminal inside each loop of the B, both terminals parallel to each other.  I took a picture of the OEM terminal plug below.  The replacement part, as you can see in the pictures, has two wide spade terminals, unprotected, with one terminal perpendicular to the other.  I take some responsibility for trusting the compatibility checker but I won't do that again.  the OEM replacement part, also available on Amazon, has the correct terminal plug.  the OEM part is seven dollars more expensive and I will have to go through the return process.  Since the housing of the pump is exactly the same as the original, I may decide to rig the terminals of the car to match the pump I received.  I have no reason to believe that this is a bad pump but the information available through Amazon is incorrect.

We have a 2012 Keystone Cougar and I noticed late last season cracks where the rubber roof meets the sides. Removal of the old trim was easy enough as was installation but make sure you have some caulk before you start. Get the non leveling type so it won't run down the sides on you. You will need to caulk the ends and where they screw on each end. My only complaint with this product is that the arch of the trim is very shallow and not nearly as much as the original factory trim. They are both 1" but this trim fits very tight and may need replaced in a couple years cause of it. You can see where the trim presses on the screws that are holding the rubber roof in place. This might not be an issue on other models but was on ours. Regardless looks much better and its installed correctly. Had plenty left over after doing the sides. This same trim is used on front and back of roof where it ends and down the back side edges of our camper.

Bought to be sprayed on an outdoor sign. Sprayed out nice. Used ratio of 16oz of paint, 1oz of hardner and 4oz  VM&P Naptha. The low gloss black looks much better than the gloss. It's semi gloss not flat. Looks great.

Installed these in my 2016 Toyota Tacoma. I'm very pleased with them so far. They match the day time LEDs perfectly so now it looks good driving around with the fog light, parking lights, and DRL on. Installation was easy and they fit perfectly. These were one of three LED purchases I got from JDM ASTAR and so far I'm very happy with all of them. Would recommend!

I really like this product. Some say it's a little pricey but I think it's worth it since it's not just for looks but functional as well. I bought it after I was towing a car trailer with my F150 and a bunch of stuff fell out of the back of the car in front of me. Because of the trailer, I couldn't dodge it and it made me worried that it would fly through the factory gap and hit the intercooler. Luckily, this time it missed, but I bought this for future protection. It doesn't look bad either and really matches the grill. Installed in approximately 3 seconds, super easy and nice fit. I haven't noticed a difference in air flow, temps, etc and I towed another heavy, loaded car trailer last weekend through the hills in 100+ degree temperature so I don't nee any negative effects. I'd definitely recommend it.

For plow skids, they mostly work as intended.  I had to use a punch to remove the last set - because I must have bent the shaft on each of them.  They are good for about one season and then I am replacing them (broken or worn through).  I just installed a new set.  Now I want to remove them as they are loud and they leave skid marks on my concrete (go figure).  There is a good chance that I need to re-adjust them.  I think moving forward I will invest my skid money in new Warn plow bars (item # 67861).

Just got this. Took me less than a minute to replace the old one. The rubber button overlay is slightly too small but with a tiny bit of gentle persuasion I was able to wrap the PCB properly. Fit perfectly into the plastic housing which snapped right together with no problems. By looking at the original and this product side by side, it appears that the replacement with the housing snappedtogether is approximately 1/8" larger in all aspects, however this could be because the original was so worn down that the matte finish had become a gloss finish meaning that age had sanded the exterior down making it smaller. Obviously the size difference is not an issue. I did run a test on all 4 buttons to ensure proper connections of button plates to PCB are good and they were.UPDATE: 2-12-18Paint on buttons doesn't seem to hold up. Delivered mid December 2017 and already this is happening. I might as well have painted new ones on the old fob and saved my money.

This High Tack Spray really helps when in stalling those paper or cork based gaskets. If you're installing a transmission pan gasket, you know how much of a pain it can be if it shifts on you when installing bolts. With this stuff, you'll never have that issue again. On top of that, it gives you some more sealing capability which is really nice if you need. it. Remains effective at temperatures of -65F to 500F (-54C to 260C). Sensor-safe. Resists gasoline, oil, antifreeze, axle lube, kerosene, propane and butane.

I was getting intermittent COOLANT errors on my dashboard, meaning that the coolant level in the surge tank was low or the gauge was not working. Since the surge tank was full, it was the gauge. I was also having trouble with P0128 errors, which usually indicate a bad thermostat, with my temperature gauge reading zero. These were separate problems.  The COOLANT error has nothing to do with the engine computer, sets no error codes, and doesn't make your car fail the emissions testing. It is simply an annoyance.  I could have solved the COOLANT error by simply jumping the wires going to the surge tank, but why be practical. Besides, the new surge tank is a nice, clean white. Very attractive.The installation is a nuisance since you have to loosen the bracket that holds the fuse box and the ECM. I could find no clear instructions, and my Haynes manual spread this job over three chapters. A nightmare.But, it was easy in the end. Removing the ECM is simple in the 2007 model. It just pulls out. Don't need to remove the wires or the frame attached to the bracket. Take the top off the fuse box (but not the inner cover. Don't touch that or the three silver bolts which hold it on. Those are your fuse box grounding screws!), and then there are three bolts holding the bracket on.The sensor is a magnetic type. Mind still worked (easy to check with an ohm meter), but the plastic/metal ring was, I think, sticking, causing intermittent errors. It looks like bathtub type scum was making it stick. See the attached picture. That's after I cleaned it out with simple green. You might be able to clean it out with some sort of scum remover and save yourself some money. Since you will not make the mistake of putting the surge tank under the mounting bracket, it would be no big job to wash it out and reinstall it.About the thermostat. They all fail, and may fail gradually, and you wind up with a cold car or a P0128 error. The car may never get into its proper temperature range. That's bad. The thermostat is hard to get to and I found it impossible to remove the radiator hose off the thermostat housing because the clamp on the thermostat housing was positioned to make its removal impossible for me. With the ECM out of the way, and the surge hose detached from the surge tank, you can remove the thermostat housing easily even with the radiator hose attached to it. The thermostat just drops right in. Easy job. The only work is to drain the coolant. That can be done in several ways. (Radiator drain, remove radiator hose, drain it right from the thermostat housing as you remove it, or the water pump drain plug, which is what I did since that was the way recommended by the Haynes manual.  They all can be a bit messy.  I would reinstall the water pump drain plug with pipe joint compound since it is a threaded connection and has a very low torque.=========Update on the Surge Tank Gauge Problem===========After more investigation, I found that the green float on the gauge is only slightly less dense than than Dexcool antifreeze. The top of the float is almost even with the level of the antifreeze, that is, there is not a lot of excess buoyancy in this system. The float actually sinks in water. The weight of the float, combined with the weight of the scum on the float, and the reduction in specific gravity of the antifreeze with increased temperatures,  I think allowed the float to sink and turn on the error message on the dashboard. If you go over some big bumps, the float likely will bottom out just due to mechanical forces. The scum may have caused increased friction between the gauge and the float, causes the gauge to stick after it bottomed out. So, if you want to try to clean out this surge tank to fix the problem, you will need to find a way to get that scum cleaned out.

I put this unit on a 2016 HD Street Bob. I wanted a nostalgic AC to finish off my stage 1 build and this fit the bill nicely. Its made well and reasonably simple to install. On a scale of 1-10 for complexity its a 4-5 only because of the breather bolts thats needed to be shimmed and vented to atmosphere. Otherwise its more of 2-3.If you look at the surface area of the air filter you can see how there's an exponential amount more intake surface than the stock filter. If you put an air cleaner like this on a stock system, make sure you compensate with a fuel delivery adjustment or its going to run real lean and you know what that means.

I bought these to replace the truck bed lights on my Ford F350 because one of them had burned out and they were only a couple of years old. I took photo's of the bed lights with one of the LED's in the right side while the old incandescent was still in the left side to show the difference. If you look you can see that the LED is a much whiter (cooler) color, and brighter than the stock 906 bulbs. If they last like they should I will never have to replace them. The price for the LED bulbs was about the same as the incandescent ones for sale at Auto Zone.

I see alot of people like these switches, but mine were horrible. The first switch I tried to install just failed. as you can see from the photos the terminals just pushed right into the body of the switch when attempting to connect the wires. this shorted out the switch and blew the fuse in the truck. The second switch installed ok, but the rocker part is very stiff. I doubt this switch will last very long. It seems cheaply made unlike the similar switches I own of the same design.

First off:  DONT GET THIS ON YOUR HANDS.  The idea is to remove oils, and it does that... from your skin too.In Short:  An engine bay with oil all over from a failed dipstick that also hasn't been washed for 13 years looks amazing after ONE USE of this amazing product.  And I was short on time, so I even did it very sloppily.  I can only imagine the amazing results you would get if you did this correctly, and with patience.Other than that, this is incredible.  I didn't have a whole bunch of time, so I could only spare about 10 minutes for the entire engine bay.  But the main idea was to get all the oil off the bay after my dipstick failed and oil sprayed all over the engine.  So I used some of this stuff, 1:6 ratio of diluting (since it has been caked on for about 6 months) and some detailing brushes.  Coated the entire engine bay, scrubbed for 3 minutes with the brush on some hard points, and power washed off... it was like brand new.  I don't know how the Chemical Guys do it but not ONE product has ever disappointed me, and for the price they offer it's incredible they can stay in business.  I've attached a few photos of the after... and I am super happy.  High high ratings for everything The Chemical Guys have to offer!

Really nice upgrade from old stock rims. On my 1995 jeep cherokee. The seller contacted me quickly to verify the type of vehicle. So they could be sure to include the correct the lug nuts.Super fast free shipping, lugs and caps included. One could not ask for more. The slight offset of these worked perfect for me. The jeep drives better than ever. More stable feel, and rides a lot smoother too. I should have done this years ago.Thanks!!!

Once, I received the product today. I decided to install them today when I completed the installation. I tested them out to see if one of the L.E.D light would blow out. What do you know it didn't thank god because, I would have return that product in a heart beat. For those of you that are thinking about purchasing this product. I posted a few photos of the License plate L.E.D for you. However, I enjoyed this product and, wouldn't mind purchasing again once, these go bad.

Very bright and solid white LED bulbs. The feel of these bulbs are very sturdy and good quality, They fit in my 2012 Mazda 6 with no issues and they look great. There's not much else to say really, other than these are nice bulbs and definitely worth the money. They sure as heck will not just fall apart as some cheaper LED bulbs tend to do. Feel free to check out the picture I included to see just how bright and white these bulbs are. As you can see, I used them for reverse lights.Please be advised that I received this item at a discounted price for an honest review.

The 4 stars are simply due to the price, what you get and especially what was expected (I had low expectations). I mainly got this for gunning primer and it did fairly well. The spray pattern was a little inconsistent, but that's why I got it for primer...it can be sanded during prep. Use caution with the cups! My first mix of primer resulted in the metal cup breaking at the fitting and dumping paint everywhere. Thankfully I wasn't over the parts when it happened. I only used one of the guns and had it on a commercial compressor; however, inline pressure for a good spray was about 26psi (it was also cold here). The inconsistency is when I would stop and start again. Even with an independent regulator on the hose along with a filter, it seemed like the spray pattern didn't stay consistent. Lubing it up and really working the trigger may help with establishing a more constant result, thus another reason for 4 stars. It didn't clog, spit or sputter and once the air valve spring works in I have no doubt it will have a positive effect on consistent spray patterns. I also considered that spray issues after longer stops may have been due to the paint cooling in the gun and as science dictates, it becomes more dense. The primer phase temps were in the mid-50s, so not the best environment to make a good judgment and I literally opened the box and used it without even disassembling it first. All-in-all, I've seen worse in more expensive guns but obviously don't expect to be putting out show car quality paint jobs. FYI, my go to gun for individual parts is an SRiPro (base and clear)...and my second one arrived with the spreader valve threads completely stripped. This kit arrived in better working condition than the manufacturer's more expensive model.

2004 jeep wrangler , this was any easy install, don't be intimidated by having to remove rear coils and drill a 3/4" hole.  I did not remove the large torx bolt as per youtube video on drivers side, instead when the axle is lowered down theres a bolt up in the jounce holder, very easy to remove and replace, just use a small ratchet and stick it thru the coil. You will want to nuke a glass of water and heat up each end of tubing, this makes life much easier. As far as drilling that 3/4" hole I used a $10.00 H-Frght. hole saw kit, go slow with some oil, you will get both holes drilled with that bit. and I used a regular electric drill, not an angle drill.  Its been in a week now, Ive towed our 14' pop up trailer and the suspension is awesome, no sagging, very tight.UPDATE : May31,2017  Its been 2 months now since I installed the airlift kit, have gone camping with 14' pop up camper and going again next week.The kit is holding up very well, Im very satisfied with the handling of the camper, and even when its not hooked up the suspension is very  good, no regrets.

I bought these seats to replace my stock seats for my 2992 Jeep Wrangler YJ.  I added 1 hole at the end of each seat slider (furnished with the seats) and they bolted right in without any additional fabrication or adapter.  The seat cushions are very soft but firm and I expect them to decrease in firmness over time. I am using these with my Tanaka 3" racing harness and harness bar. They all work very well together. One CON that I should have expected, is that the seats are 9" thick at the base and all that extra comfort decreases the distance between lap and the bottom of the steering wheel.  I am 6'0" and 185 lbs, and in my case this is not an issue.  Attached is a pic of the finished installation

A challenge to get on, didn't think it was going to fit at first. Which is a good thing because since it has a tight fit, it's not going to slip or slide off while driving. You have to work it around each section slowly. This is on my 2014 Jeep Patriot. Feels durable, just hope the threading on the sides last. I'll update if anything changes over time.

kind of kicking myself for buying this bag. it EASILY swallows the Griots 6" polisher with 25' cord.  I bought it for the sole purpose of storing the polisher and pads ONLY. The lower compartment fits about 12 5.5 foam pads. the way the bag opens, closes is a little, strange, but it allows for lots of access. Inside pockets help organize and keep little parts and tools for the buffer. The top bag handle is a little strange, requires assembly. surprised no pre-assembly for the cost? i feel like i could have gotten a less bulky tool bag that holds the buffer, and pads, for less money, in a smaller package and footprint, at a local big box store. Disclaimer: i do not need to store bottles or chemicals in this bag. if you need a place for your chemicals, rags, pads, AND buffer then this is the right bag for you. This bag is made well, with materials that feel like good quality. it's just a little bulky for my basic application and use. Here is the griots bag next to the husky 15 inch bag. Both hold the buffers and pads. But only the griots will have the room and security for your chemicals.

This is a great paint coating to use in place of waxes and sealents. But for this product to work correctly you really need to prep the paint properly. Starting with stripping road film, then paint decontamination (brake dust, tar, sap). Finishing off with something like a Shine Supply Flattop compound polish in one, and wipe everything down Eraser.  Once the paint is smooth, clean and scratch free, applying the coating is a breeze.  Usually taking less than an hour, but much quicker if you use a two-person team. We apply this coating to our fleet vehicles, and it has been holding up great for almost a year on some. And that's saying a lot being where in the Northeast with harsh winters. We do decontaminate and apply Carpro Reload every few months to keep the coating up. Normal In between  washes  include foaming with PDP lemon suds in a foam cannon and microfiber mitting, which restores it's hydrophobic properties to like new.Overall a fantastic product, but allocate at least a whole day if you want to do it right

Great winch, have used several times since installation and everything works great.  I especially like the different mounting options for the solenoid, makes it very versatile.

It worked for my 2004 4Runner which had a special lug nut installed to prevent theft. Had trouble finding anyone with this key and went out on a limb buying this and it worked! It was an exact fit also. It seems to be strong!

The Dodge/Chrysler visor clip mounts correctly in to replace the original.  BEWARE. The opening on the clip for the sun visor is too narrow.  Forcing the visor into the clip may break it since it is very tight.  I took a file to make the opening wider.  This was very simple and only took about five minutes.  After my alteration, the clip is working fine. Don't be afraid to order this.  Once adjusted, it works like it should!

Looks good on car BUT it is NOT raised off of the car it actually sticks onto the vehicle I don't see how that will "shield the hood" but looks good nevertheless...If you are lookin for a "bug shield" that is supposed to throw the air over your vehicle this prob is not for you..........After having this on my hood for over a year it has since came untaped NOT WORTH RETAPING!!

These are way better than the oem shorties on my 2002 2500hd sierra.  I got the chrome version with oem looking yellow markers. Only thing that bugs me with all these aftermarket towing mirrors is that they are not level with the ground. They tilt upwards and it takes some time getting used to it. So I deducted a star for that.

I have used this pump a couple of times now, this thing is fast! I have the smaller Harbor Freight air compressor that I have used for several years and that has been good but this Ring RAC635 is awesome! Simplicity is the key, you set the pressure you want the pump to reach and it will pump the tires to that pressure, how simple is that! It's the same feature America's Tires have at their free air check station.Positives:- Air release is 1 simple button which is a nice feature.- Auto shutoff when pressure is met.- Light is an excellent option.Items to note:- When I set the pressure to 34, the pump will air to 33.5, so I had to bump up the desired - pressure .5 lbs higher.- The attachment to the tire is plastic, I hope it doesn't break easily.

Glad I went with the darker version looks great on my 2012 600RR.  It was delivered lightning (Prime) fast without it being a prime order.  Windscreen was packaged safely and am very impressed with the fit and finish.  I would highly recommend.  I am able to still see through the windscreen and all gauges.  Customer service at Powersport Superstore was excellent.  They responded to my question via email within hours and as explained above was delivered well ahead of my expectation.  I will do business with Zero Gravity and Powersport Superstore again in the future.  Adding a picture for with aftermarket Factory Effex screws I bought for fun.  For the price in addition to the Factory Effex screw "tips" this purchases has exceeded my expectations.

Just got these in today h13 size And they look great. I was really confused at first on how to wire it but a YouTube video later and it was very easy. The hardest part was taking the bulb off the harness of my 2016 Chevy spark. Couldn't find anything online or in the manual how to disconnect it. I used my old SDX ballasts and it works just fine. Color is great, I got the 10k.  I will update in a few months once I use them for a while.

I purchased two of these filters for my commercial zero turn with a Kawasaki FX 600v and they arrived as pictured in the Kawasaki box and with the sticker on the filter. However my original engine factory filter had no sticker but had stamping on the filter saying Kawasaki and 49065-7007. I suppose this filter s an OEM filter it says USA made and Kawasaki on the sticker, and came in the Kawasaki box. I am not too worried it appears to be an OEM filter from what I can tell but I do know however that the OEM filter has a 25/30 micron filter media so anything less isn't filtering the oil to factory specs, and I would do exactly the same as some others have done, I would send it back if I had received anything different. This is a popular small engine filter and you can find them online that are true genuine Kawasaki OEM even cheaper but you just have to do the research.Shortly after I made this purchase I found online a professional commercial mower and engine supplier for my blades, belts, and everything else related to my mower, who only sells OEM or else it is stated on the website this part or filter or whatever the item, is not OEM, and if it is not even their OEM replacement items are of acceptable or equivalent quality and at a significant reduced price, I just ordered a mulch kit and replacement blades and specified OEM. They checked and they only sell OEM for the parts I ordered and assured me the items I would receive would be OEM factory parts, so I order from them and their genuine OEM Kawasaki filter 49065-7007 is 5.99 at this current writing and 5.45 in bulk of 12 or more. That's a deal for the commercial guys. It looks and appears to be OEM from what I can tell, If what you receive is the same filter as the item pictured. I found no problem with this filter and I would order again if I would ever need to. The genuine Kawasaki OEM filter ordered from the professional parts co. Who sells OEM Kawasaki filters also has a sticker and looks the same as this one. Why my original factory OEM Kawasaki filter that came with my brand new mower had printing on the filter and not a sticker I don't know why.......? I hope the filters with the stickers are OEM. Hmmmm! ........I may need to research that. Anyhow....I posted pics of what I received and I have no worries. I feel perfectly comfortableI in their ability to adequately filter since I change my oil and filter way sooner than the recommended interval. Therefore even if I found out that the filters with the stickers and not the printing are not OEM then I still am not sending them back. I just would not purchase them again since my primary preference is the Kawasaki OEM.

These lights are extremely bright. Bought the 20" light bar. Installed it on the front of my 2014 Ram (see pictures). Fits perfect in the air intake for the transmission cooler. Left enough room to still get good air flow. 30" would have been too big and I was concerned about getting enough air circulation.The spot bulbs put out good light in front of the rig, but aren't powerful enough to get out beyond the stock headlights, but they are a great compliment and help brighten directly in front of the vehicle.The best part of this setup is the flood bulbs. I swear they almost light up 90 degrees to the perpendicular! They light up the sides of the road amazingly well. With these lights, it should be far easier to see anything on the sides of the road. I understand that these aren't likely legal for on-road use, but in the middle of nowhere TX, in the middle of the night, on empty roads, rest assured that these lights will be on and helping me spot deer and hogs before I hit one.Price is awesome as well. You cannot find a better deal than this light bar. I did do, as other reviewers have noted, and used silicone caulking around where the cord enters the housing to keep water out. Time will tell on the longevity, but it appears that it should last. Very heavy duty construction.I hope you found this review to be helpful, please click below to indicate that you did. Thanks

Lubriplate 10 OZ Low Temp Lithium Garage Door GreasePros:- excellent lubricant- large tube, so you won't run out any time soon- excellent value, especially when compared to Genie GLU-3 Screw Drive Garage Door Opener Lubricant, which costs about 10 times as much per ounce.  (Grease from both products is white and has the same consistency; it seems to be the same grease.)Cons:- tip has a tiny dimple in the center which you are supposed remove in order to lay a narrow bead of grease.  Try to cut it out with a utility knife and you could easily cut yourself.  I used a tiny punch to poke a small hole in the end and then drilled out that hole with a 7/64" drill bit.  If you cut the tip of the tube off entirely, the bead of grease will be 1/4" in diameter.Other:- it doesn't say "garage door grease" on the tube's printing, but there is a paper sticker on the tube that labels it as such.  In any case, it seems perfectly suited to Genie screw drives or other purposes.Summary:Terrific bargain for excellent grease.

I like that this would have worked for a Single or Double DIN installation, but I was surprised when I had to cut plastic to make the 2-DIN opening.  Fortunately, the area you cut is hidden, so I used some snips and a Dremel to get it done in a few minutes.  It looks good in my RAV4. The color is comparable to the trim. The top of the bracket is flat and not curved like the factory trim so there is a tiny gap on the top left and right (see pic), but it's not enough to get worked up about.  FYI I used a Kenwood DPX501BT.  The opening was not large enough to put the receiver in backside-first,so I had to push the bracket over the front of the unit and it was a tight fit, but the end result looks good.  The screw holes lined up with the factory mounts.  The bracket is plastic where the factory mount was metal so don't overtighten the screws when reinstalling.

Bought this SW 9500 TS from Amazon for $270. Very smooth operation , quitter then I expected. And line speed seems plenty fast enough. Make sure you check the power wires as once mounted you can t get to the negative wire. Mine was very loose, and would have cause problems later. The fairlead maybe SS coated are a thin SS pipe with a plastic insert / bushing. But its not SS solid stock very lite. Hope it holds up. Now I mounted it on  E-Autogrilles 07-17 Jeep Wrangler JK Full Width Front Bumper with LED Lights & 2xD-Ring & Winch Plate . Looks great But don t buy the neoprene cover with this bumper it won t fit.  I seldom need a winch so Hopefully this will last many years. How could I go wrong at this price.

I replaced a reese tri-ball that rusted and looked bad, I have it on craigslist now, still good for utility use.  I mainly have mine for looks.  This is the first time I seen it with the hook, I like it a lot.  The black finish matches my truck and it looks like it won't rust.  I just wish the "connor" tag was it the upright position when the hook is in the use position like it is shown here.  Mine is upside down.

If you're going to change your own oil, you must have one of these!  Save yourself frustration, skinned-up knuckles, and wearing out the oil filter cap prematurely and get an oil filter socket if you don't have one already.  This particular one is high quality and fits the oil filter cap it is designed for like a glove.  Truthfully, this is the first oil filter cap socket that I've used after years of countless oil changes, and I'll never go back to using an oil filter wrench again if it can be avoided.  This is so much simpler and easy to use that once you use it you'll never want to do another oil change without it.

I was concerned, but hopeful that these wheel stops would work for me (I will attempt to post related photos).  Per other comments, my tire size and spacing would be fine.  My concern was a large portion of frame that extends out, well between the tires.  NOT A PROBLEM!  I was able to easily reposition the stops at one end of the tightening bolt and they installed as hoped.  It will be a few weeks before I am able to test their effectiveness, but based on the other comments I suspect they will do well.

These are decent mirrors for the price. We bought them for a 1985 Honda Nighthawk 700S, and the primary reason for buying these was the lack of selection for black mirrors. That being said, they're not bad. I would've like a little more longer mirror glass for better viewing, but they work. We don't experience any significant vibration blurring and they installed without any issues.

These were supposed to be the exact replacement based on the codes in my glove box.  I cross-referenced them through several sources.  They hardly resemble the shocks I removed as they are larger diameter and have a steel boot instead of plastic.  I feel they are quite stiff- like a HD truck shock- and do not offer the ride and handling the previous shocks were tuned to deliver on my Saab 9-7x

Horrible product. At first glance it looks like a good buy and solid construction. First off, it's definitely NOT 288 watts. Not even close. The bar is bright but not even close to as bright as 288 watts should be. My 12" light bar is just as bright as a 50" bar which it shouldn't be. 2 days after install, it has already built up condensation. It was only turned on 2 times. I know you get what you pay for but it's definitely not a good buy. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more and get a quality bar.

When I received these, they would not move so they couldn't be adjusted. The finish was ok (I wasn't expecting the best for the money), with only some pretty minor issues. They were a lot bigger than I expected, but the major reason for returning was they couldn't be adjusted. Might have just gotten a bad set.

If you're looking at this one you're probably looking at it because it's the cheapest option for this style hitch carrier ramp for your dirt bike / motorcycle.  I know I was..On the plus side, the carrier itself felt plenty strong to hold my bike (2011 YZ450F).  I added a hitch stabilized to stop it from rolling side to side and honestly that part was fine.The biggest negative, however, is the ramp.  It's so short you might as well be throwing your bike up on the ramp.  See pictures..  The second negative is there are only two points where you can connect straps, and I really prefer 4.  If this carrier had some sort of wheel chock up front then maybe 2 straps would be sufficient, but for me that just wasn't enough.  And for the last negative point, we're back to the ramp.  There's no way to lock the ramp into the carrier to make sure it doesn't move while loading.. there's just a lip on the ramp that lines up with a lip on the carrier and you're left with friction barely holding them together.  If you don't push the bike straight enough or soft enough (which is hard to do given how short the ramp is..) then it's very easy to knock the ramp off the carrier and then you've got a bigger problem (ask me how I know..).  One last negative--the ramp is so narrow that a standard tire on a 450F was too wide to use it easily.  It kept getting stuck making it even more difficult to push the bike up the ramp, which made an even bigger mess since the ramp really wasn't connected to the carrier.So, that's pretty much it.  The ramp sucks horribly, otherwise it's a carrier that seemed strong enough to do it's job, albeit a bit short of strapping points.  I would not recommend buying this model unless you have a hill or something you can use to help make the short ramp not matter, or have a bike light enough that it doesn't really matter.  I would NOT even think about loading anything on to this ramp that is larger than 450 4 stroke.I sent this one back and got the one below instead.. it's a much nicer setup, includes a wheel chock that does a good job of stopping the front tire from moving, had 4 hold down points and.. yep, it has a ramp that's long enough to make loading much easier.  The ramp is also much wider which makes things easier.  Oh, and it even has a little locking pin that holds the ramp to the carrier so it can't come off while loading.

For me, this stuff worked great! Made a welding cart for my mig & bottle an just painted the raw steel with the suggested 3 coats and am very satisfied. Used this for my test before using on my Hot Rod parts. I only used the wrinkle paint on visible metal the rest (like the bottom etc) I used just black paint an thats why no wrinkle

The size chart is so important!This is the third or fourth stitch on leather wheel cover I've installed over the last 20 years. It was luck of the draw whether or not the width would work well (not diameter, but the width as it wraps around and stitches. Being able to measure the wheel and choose the appropriate wrap makes a much better end result.That said, this is the best overall wrap I've ever used. The size is correct, the leather is a nice, thick leather, and the holes are cleanly cut. I am very pleased, and it probably took me about 45 minutes to an hour.This was a 2006 Toyota Tundra. The stitch to stitch measurement of the wheel was exactly 4.5". Per the size chart, this became an L+. Stitched toghtly, I think the L would actually have worked a little more cleanly. However, this is still the best result I've ever achieved with a stitch on wrap.In comparison, the common slip-over wheel covers just don't compare.Note-- if you attempt this, it's totally normal to realize you botched something, need to undo stitching and go again. The quality of the results is worth it.

It should be noted that they are NOT advertising these to be used for regular headlights, which is good because for normal headlights, you'll want something with a higher light output.  But for fog lamps, driving running lights, they're great.  Also for off road vehicles such as ATVs, they would make great additional lights, enabling a lot of light to be generated at very little electrical cost on a small engine.I used these for my projector fog lights.  They have a nice pure white appearance, and were direct replacements for the existing lights.  They are not nearly as bright as full H11 regular bulbs, however the pure white color does make up a lot of the difference.On the meter each light draws an average of .56A @ 12VDC or around 6.7Watts, that's not much... even by LED standards.  I think that's why they don't appear all that bright, though installing them in projector lenses does help to concentrate the light output.  If I were to compare the output to normal car bulbs... your average headlight bulb is about 55watts... I'd say these produce the equivalent light of about a 35 to 40watt bulb.  (though in a much more pure white, not orange, color)The lights do have a voltage regulation circuit in them that also eliminates the need for polarity.  So don't worry, there is no specific positive or negative on these meaning they'll work in your car regardless of how your plug is wired.  I noticed that between 11.3 and 11.4 volts, there was a slight drop in brightness as the voltage was rising, this seems to be the "next level" of resistance kicking in, though the brightness quickly stabilizes as it approaches 12VDC.  In other words, for most applications, you won't have to worry about over driving them.  And if you are under driving them, you won't see a a drop off in brightness until below 11VDC.Overall, for the applications they are being advertised for, they work great and I'm quite pleased overall.I was able to purchase these at a discount in exchange for agreeing to write an honest and unbiased product review.

I've owned these for about 2 years. And I like them enough to buy another pair ... until today. Today while driving down the road the plastic pin on one apparently broke (see picture). My kayak promptly slipped out of the tie down, fell off the car and went careening down a ditch by the side of the road. I am quite fortunate that I was only going 45 mph, it fell off on the passenger side, and the kayak wasn't destroyed in the process. Note that I had only hand tightened the system that holds it onto the car and it was a while ago (many many weeks). Certainly this could be just bad luck. Or more frightening the plastic pins might get weak with time and lead to this kind of failure. Given that the pins are under quite a bit of stress, it seems to me that they probably should be made of steel or something stronger. Needless to say, the new pair I just bought is going back and I'll be searching for two sets that use metal rather than plastic.

As a college kid I don't have much cash to spare and my soft top on my YJ is showing its age. I wanted to buy a bikini top and leave my soft top in storage for about 9 months out of the year and only really use it during winter. This top is about $20 cheaper than the others I saw and had no reviews so I decided to buy and test it out.... I love it!It rained 20mins after putting it on and I did get a little wet, with the half doors and plastic window you have to remove the plastic "rails" on the sides of the windshield (for the stock soft top) After that I stayed dry.I would gladly purchase this product again.

UPS delivered this morning, had it on the pickup in 30 min.  Easy install, didn't have to grind the crossmember on my 2000 F350 like many have posted, cranks very fast compared to my 150,000 mile factory stock starter.All of that was good, but what what has me displeased is that the third time to start it hung up and didn't disengage.  Would think a brand new starter would properly disengage.Really dissatisfied with this purchase at the moment hopefully db or Amazon makes it right with me.

Purchased a set to do the drivers side of my wifes 2006 Dodge Durango 4.7l. It had an exhaust leak when cold, but went away as it warmed up. Knowing I had to do this on the passenger side exhaust manifold about 4 years prior, I ordered a set of these and they worked perfectly. Thankfully the bolt broke at the exhaust manifold, not the head. Was able to replace all bolts, the gasket in less than an hour. Was very happy with the results.

I start with the short version:  I like the bulb, for the price it is quite impressive regarding true performance (I am talking about true light output - details below).  I can't tell about durability as I don't have them long enough to justify.  One star removed for false description and performance claims.Now a bit more technical details:The bulb is described (as of today: May 21 2017) with the following technical spec:Voltage  12 voltsWattage  5.5 wattsItem Package Quantity  2Type of Bulb  LEDLuminous Flux  1000 lmOut of these 5 important data, 2 are completely inaccurate (worth one star off).1. Power.Each bulb measured at 12V takes 0.36A that is 4.32W.  That is 78% of the claimed power.  The actual power used by LED chips is lower.  The is 0.9V drop on MB6F bridge rectifier using 0.32W.  The 0.12W is used by high efficiency LED dimming driver based on PT4115 chip.  So the total power delivered to LED chips is 3.88W (that is 86.2mW per LED chip).2. Luminous Flux.Bulb contains 45 high efficiency 4014 Lumiled chips.  I don't know which CRI chip was used 70 or 80 but I suspect that it is 80 at 138lm/W.  Using simple calculation without measuring I estimate the total light output is 535lm.  That is only 54% of claimed light output.  Yes, it is almost twice the light output comparing to incandescent T15 bulb, but not even close to 1000lm shown in product description.Regarding the quality of assembly and parts used I am not 100% satisfied.  Some LED chips show sign of abuse (cracked lenses, burn marks shown on the close-up pictures) and quality of soldering is average to marginal.  Actually in the set of two I got, each bulb is a version (different PC-Board markings) and one does not have finished base (broken of PC Board is not finished) shown on the picture.  Time will tell how this will affect durability.

Mounted on a 2004 TJ. The bumper itself is substantial. Quite a bit heavier than stock. The finish was mostly perfect on the one I received, there are a few spots where it chipped off a little. Packaged well. It included the two shackles. The included hardware (screws, washers, lock washers, backing plates) are of mixed quality. The lock washers unwound on 6 of the 8 bolts. My package didn't include the drill template but I made my own. Drill to 1/2" or even 9/16" to allow some alignment adjust-ability.I will say that this bumper is tucked up tight! If I'm going to hit something on a rock back there it will be my gas tank skid, spare tire, or the exhaust pipe.

Looks very nice. Skull was slightly crooked, but not so bad anyone will probably ever notice. I wish the front bolt had 3 or 4 more threads. I used my stock nut up front because the long acorn nut that came with it was too close to the fins on my front head for my tastes. I could have put the bolt in through the back and the acorn nut on the outside, but I wanted the bolt heads to match on the shifter end and the transmission end. I also replaced the supplied front washer with a stainless lock washer and put blue Loctite on all threads. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and would definitely recommend for the price.

It's fits on a 12,000# Harbor Freight Tools (Badland) winch.  It has some play left over. No big deal.  It's the second one in  two years (25- 27 months) as sun light will ruin it in about 1-1/2 - 2 years, but it's less than $15.  It will crack and fade in color.  The more costly ones would be ruin in color, but may not crack, but would turn in color.too.  I like how it fits and stays a deep black color. Jeep is white with black accents.  The winch stays completely dry all the time, regardless of what the weather or terrain is.  It fits really snug while has a little room left over.  Don't know what else to say to less than $15, but I'll get another one in about 20 - 24 months later, unless someone gets me a different one for birthday, father's day, etc.  It comes off and on fairly easy  I can't believe I have written this much for a $15 product...Just get it.

This kit fit perfectly on our 2013 Kia Soul. I followed their instructions to break in the pads and everything worked perfectly. The brakes do not squeal or make any noises, and the braking power was slightly increased.They included a small tube of backing plate lube but I found that it was not enough and bought another tube from Pep Boys.The kit came with several different rubber bolt sleeves. Also included were stainless steel pad holders that fit and worked perfectly, although I did have to bend the stainless tabs to make them fit more snugly.All in this is a fantastic quality and functioning brake kit that I will buy again and recommend.

Excellent fit for my 2014 Toyota Prius v Three. Provides maximum coverage for the front windscreen and small triangle windows. I did not have any problems rolling or unrolling the sunshade.Together with custom fit driver and passenger window sunshades (sold elsewhere for $29.99) and already excellent tinting on my vehicle, I now have extreme privacy when I park my car on public streets. No more OPP fascination with light-fingered pedestrian passersby.

I bought this for a 4,600 mile road/camping trip with my 06 Pontiac Vibe.It worked great, and kept everything dry during several days of rain.I did have to drill a couple new mounting holes to move the cargo box far enough forward so I could still open the rear hatch.To give you an idea of size, I was able to fit three milk crates with some room to sparePros- Small, does not effect the car other than maybe lowering my MPG by 1 or 2 miles- Keeps everything dry- Great to have extra space for camping gear, or whateverCons- Small, couldn't fit everything I hoped- Assembly was a challenge because of the placement of the hinges- Feels flimsy, though once locked, even without a strap, I didn't have any issues, even at 80mph

Wow this is a great product! First use, usually use Meguiar's #26, great stuff as well, but thought to try NXT out.  This went on with little effort and if you do not wait too long; easy to buff and polish to a mirror like shine.  I used two microfiber towels one for initial wipe off, then followed with a thicker towel.  I used a new set for the other half of the car. Lastly, gave a once over, the entire vehicle, with a 24"x24" extra-plush microfiber towel. The results are stunning and I felt that I used less effort with NXT then have when using the #26.

AWESOME SHOCK ABSORBERS!! I have a 2015 Silverado with 57,000 miles on it (I drive a lot for my job). Truck wasn't riding bad or anything, but I knew it wasn't like the day I bought it. I replaced the factory Rancho shocks which come on the Z71 package with these Monroe Reflex's, I'm SO glad I did!! No regrets! The truck rides WAY better, less jarring going over pot holes and bumps in the road. It's definitely a firm ride, but not uncomfortable by any means. Seems to handle better as well. I've got pneumatic tools so it took me less than 15 minutes. No need to jack up the truck, just got my creeper out rolled underneath the truck and unfastened the 21mm bolts. Easy breezy install! I am very pleased with the Monroe Reflex shocks, great price, and a surprisingly comfortable ride for how firm they are. If you've got 50k-60k miles or more on your truck, I highly recommend changing your shocks out. They probably feel alright to you, but shocks degrade over time and you're in the vehicle everyday so it goes unnoticed until you actually replace them with new shocks. For around $100 to replace them yourself and not that much time with simple tools, it's a relatively inexpensive and noticeable upgrade to your truck.

I've got a long history with OTC products, and generally trust them to get the job done.  I was disappointed to read here that production had moved to China on these ball joint presses.  I agonized over it for a month, thinking if I'm going to get Chinese tools, I might as buy the lower priced Astro competitor and pay for Chinese tools.I finally decided that I was going to go with my gut and buy the OTC, knowing that I'd had great success with them in the past.  I was absolutely beside myself when I opened the box and saw "Made in USA" on the case, and even more so when I opened the case and the press has "Made in USA" forged into it.I don't know if I got old stock or what, but this is exactly what I wanted.  I'm about to get busy changing all the u-joints in my Jeep..

There is an adage "You get what you pay for" this duster is a prime example of that.  Pick it up and you can feel the quality.  Plus it is so much easier to use than other dusters.  It has a locking extendable handle that allows me to reach from one side of the roof of my car to the other.  The extendable handle locks with a twist.  The handle grip is rubberized and very comfortable in the hand.Most importantly, the duster grabs and holds the dust.  This is an unusually nice duster and worth every penny.  Highly recommended.

It works, however, the quality control was horrible. Both ends of the tube were dented. I used a hammer and straightened it out. The plastic adapter had plastic shavings hanging all over it so I used a file to smooth all of the raised surfaces and clean all the shavings so they didn't enter the combustion chamber and possibly damage my engine. IMO, another poorly inspected product shoved down the assembly line and thrown into a box. For this kind of money, look elsewhere.

I got these for my 1994 GMC Sierra K1500 4X4 because the factory wheels were showing considerable wear and I wanted to update the old truck a little. I posted some pictures, the wheels are a little dirty after rain and weeks of use.I went to the "Moto Wheel" website to verify the Amazon application listing. There were a lot of possible applications however the Amazon information that "this fits your 1994 GMC K1500" was correct.I do not know a lot about wheel applications and offsets etc, so I called Moto Wheel to check. They told me to get a zero offset or a positive offset and said do not get a negative offset.My bolt pattern is 6 lugs and the studs are 5.5 inches apart from center to center. The listing states the wheels are 16 X 8 /6X 139.7mm. There is a web site "[...]" where I was able to verify that 139.7 millimeters = 5.5 inches.I ordered these wheels based on Amazon's application recommendation and they fit perfectly. I have posted pictures, these wheels have more of a lip than the stock wheels and appear to stick out a little further than the stock wheels, and it looks great. I am pleased with the wheels, the fit and appearance and the application information.I stayed with the 16" wheels so I could maintain a good truck type tire. I looked at 18" wheels but in order to keep my speedometer accurate I would have to go to an 18" tire with a shorter sidewall. In other words to keep a simular aspect ratio I would need to get a tire not as tall. Additionally it appeared that there are more tire selections in the 16" sizes and they are less expensive. There are tire size calculators on line where you can put in the stock tire size and then select other sizes and the calculator will tell you the effect on your speedometer. They recommend something within a 3% variance. One site I found was [...]

Terrific price on a great hitch. Installed easily on my 2013 Cadillac SRX Premium with little problems with the holes lining up like some others have posted. I taped up the outline of the cut area and took a Dremel Multitool oscillating cutting blade to the fascia bumper cover then used the wire brush attachment tool to carefully remove the plastic burrs and rough spots. Took about 30 minutes. From ground level the finished product looks good. Pics show the cut I needed to make in order to give the cover room to expose the safety chain brackets. I'm only going to use this for a bike rack so no need to hook up wires on my part. Very happy.

I purchased the L size steering wheel cover for my 2001 F-150. The steering wheel flakes off and sticks to my hands when wet. This cover fits great an will keep my hands clean, but is a bit lumpy over the spokes. Hopefully that will smooth out and take shape on a hot day.

I picked up a set of these at Sams Club yesterday for $320 + tax w free installation.  I have a 2007 Honda Civic LX.  I was running Yokohama Avids.  These are much better. The ride is softer and more pliant.  There appears to be little to no road noise.  Grip is excellent.  Anxious to see how they perform in the wet.  For the money and the brand you are getting a great tire.  Highly recommend.

This inverter was easy to install and it powers my 700 watt microwave like it's child's play. The installation is a bit time consuming though.  I had to figure out where to mount it and run the wires. I chose to mount directly behind the passenger seat on the wall of the storage cabinet in the sleeper area,  I used putty along the bottom of the inverter when I attached it with screws to prevent vibration from the road. The wires were able to be run behind the storage cabinet and then through the floor by removing a drain plug underneath the carpet. Must use extreme caution to protect the wire from rubbing bare against any metal or plastic to prevent a short/fire. I used zip ties and plenty of electrical tape. I'm not sure why Amazon indicates 2 wire install kits are required for the 2500 watt inverter,  I used 1 wire kit and it works just fine. Just be sure to use a 250 amp fuse within a short distance of your power wire connection. I was able to get power near my A\C filter in the engine compartmentUPDATE June 2016:Apparently using just one set of wires wasn't a good idea after all. The unit worked fine for awhile until one day when I apparently had 1 too many appliances running at the same time. The power consumption was too large for one set of wires to handle and they burnt to a crisp. I wound up having to replace the wires and this time I used 2 wire sets and 2 fuses from the same battery source and the unit now works great, no more low voltage indicator noise coming from it. Live and learn.

We bought this for our recent trip from OH/PA area to SC.  We thought the idea was great and would eliminate the overhead carrier.  We pack very light, especially for a beach trip and weighed our cargo carefully to make sure it was well under the weight limit (100 lbs) for this.  The installation was very difficult and as engineers, it should not take 2.5 hours to get this strapped onto our vehicle.  We have a 2012 Kia Sorrento.  I've posted photos above to show how it looked hanging off of our car.Problems:- Installation was a pain.  The rods in the bottom do not stay in the slots so the box shaped item you see in the photos from the manufacturer are NOT what you will be driving with on the back of your car, unless you're packing your carrier with empty cardboard boxes.  As seen in my photos, this bag hangs off the back of your vehicle like a sloppy backpack full of sand.  Loading it before installing it onto your car doesn't work, it just falls apart as well as needing 3-4 people to hold it while someone straps all of the straps in.  The belt that fits around the bag and is supposed to hug the inside of your liftgate may be one of the worst parts of this.  How to open your liftgate with a 75lb+ bag strapped to it, keep it open without having it slam down onto someone and fit the belt around AND tighten it?-The rods did not stay in place - I can't emphasize this enough.  Without the rods, it doesn't not hold the box-like shape.  It would be the same if you took a giant garbage bag, filled it with your luggage and tied it to the back of your vehicle.  It was awful trying to pack it, get things in/out of it at rest stops and unpacking it.-The buckle BROKE in the middle of our trip which required us to buy an expensive rooftop carrier or pay to have all of our clothing, etc. shipped home as there is zero cargo space in our Kia.  We were terribly upset and disappointed to have to use a chunk of our vacation funds to buy a replacement carrier, take the time out of our trip to find one, etc.  Especially after paying $150 for this.  We've had a regular canvas rooftop carrier for 10 years that cost about $50 and is still going strong.  Unfortunately, we left it at home since we bought the Rightline Gear Cargo Saddlebag to replace it.-We attempted to repair the buckle ourselves with bungee cords & string (another trip to the store and more money spent) but it didn't feel secure at all.-The design of the straps does not hold it up high like shown in the photos, it was hanging down by our exhaust which is a safety issue.This is a good concept but very poorly executed, designed and manufactured.  I can't believe they used such cheap plastic on buckles that are going to be holding a heavy item to the back of a moving vehicle.  I can't imagine how awful it would have been if this had broken while we were moving and fallen off on the car behind us.  I also don't understand how they managed to make the metal frame too small for the carrier?I cannot recommend this in any way.  There are far better carriers out there that are cheaper, better made and won't fall apart mid-vacation.  This seems to be an issue with other reviewers who have recently purchased this carrier.Stay away and save yourself time, money and headache as well as a huge lawsuit if it falls off and injures someone, damages your property as well as someone else's.  Buyer beware.

SuperVizor XT = Gut Hook. I purchased 10 SuperVizor XT's after being in a car accident last year and almost not getting my seat belt unlatched. I bought 1 for each of my employees. As soon as they saw them, many of the employees started calling them "gut hooks" and were saying they would be using them while deer hunting. So, life saving device or dear cleaning tool or both; take your pick. Either way, this is a pretty cool little tool for the price.

First off what's wrong with my posted picture of the item? Yes the needle is on the wrong side of the stop pin rendering gauge useless.So,... How did they "calibrate" the gauge??? Magic, alternate universe where things are opposite?? Surely they weren't dishonest by saying they in fact did calibrate when they didn't?? Could it be??Buyer be ware, cheap gauge pretending to be something good when it's crap. I will be purchasing a quality brand name gauge, lesson learned

I've never been all that picky about wiper blades, in that I change them at least twice a year (winter in PA can be hard on them). I've used Michelin, Rain-X, Valero, Anco, along with some other brands.This set of Anco blades was my first in a number of years, and I have to say they're off my list of approved brands. First of all, the refill is constructed almost entirely of plastic. The pivoting blade holders simply snap into place on the larger refill. Within about three hours of installing this set of blades, one blade holder broke, and until the mist function quit, I was extremely worried the scraping blade holder would scratch my newly installed windshield (some hundreds of dollars spent the previous day).I used the opportunity to compare the Anco construction to a comparably priced Michelin blade available at Walmart. The Michelin blade is all metal, and has metal pins that secure each pivoting piece to the larger holder. The Michelin blade also attaches to my vehicle's wiper arm without use of some hokey adapter. Compare this to the Anco blade, which is all plastic, snaps together (which doesn't inspire confidence in a storm or driving at higher speeds) and attaches with a silly adapter.I've uploaded photos comparing the Anco to a Michelin.I have no plans to waste any more money buying Anco blades. There are too many other inexpensive brands that are simply better constructed.

I needed more outlets in my truck and after looking at a few and reading some of their reviews I pretty much went 'eeny meeny miny moe' and ended up getting this one. It's a hefty well constructed plastic box with 4 outlets and a nice long cord. Small enough it fits perfectly where I wanted it. The receptacles are tight and the plugs fit snug and securely. Most importantly, it works without any problems. So far I only have a dash cam and a small video monitor being powered from it and they've started up every time like they should when the key is turned and this extender gets power. Supposedly it only has a 10 amp fuse, so take that into account if you plan on running anything heavy through it. My monitor and dash cam are only drawing like maybe 1 amp total, so 4 similar devices shouldn't be a problem either.It comes with two options to mount it; Small slide out tabs in the body that you use provided screws with, or double-sided foam tape. I wasn't keen on drilling holes so I opted for the double-sided tape. That lasted about 3 minutes before just falling off where I was attempting to mount it sideways. This box isn't that heavy, but heavier than the cheap tape can think about holding up. It might work okay if you just had it sitting and the tape was simply a means to stop it from sliding around. But don't even bother trying to use it if you plan on mounting it under or on the side of something. I got some scotch 3m extreme mounting tape instead and it's stuck on well. So aside from the worthless double-sided tape, I'm happy with it.

This product is great and they are still working great after two months of use. I installed it inside my 2003 Corolla S and it didn't even take 2 minutes. All I did was pop in the car charger for the lights, pop off part of the dashboard around the car charger outlet, run the wires and lights through the consoled down to the feet area of the car, pushed the lights under that part of the console, adhere them to the plastic at the top of the feet area for the passenger and driver seats, and I was done! Now all of the wires are hidden, the lights cannot be seen unless you really get down low and look for them, and the car charger has the wires go straight into the console.The blue lights work great when on all the time and the car charger also has a sound sensitivity control dial built into it. So you when you put the lights on music mode by simply changing the switch on the car charger, you can then vary how sensitive the lights are to sound, making them flash more or less depending on what you like! This feature works amazingly well.My friends love to ride in my car and rock out to music with the blue roof lights in the back seat (simply swap the interior roof lights from a standard bulb to a blue led bulb, which can be bought on Amazon for very cheap, and I would highly recommend doing this because it is so cool looking and gets so much attention and nice comments) and my music synthesized lights under the front seats. The color blue is very easy on the human eye so you won't have to worry about that. And it is not bright enough to be a distraction or problem for you or other drivers. These features are so easy to do, are so cheap, will impress a lot of people, and make your car look more sleek.So go ahead and spend the money. You won't regret it and your friends will definitely like it! :)If you have any other questions, just comment on this review and I will answer them as soon as possible.

If you own a newer model pickup truck, something like this is almost an absolute necessity - unless you're either under 25 years old, an athlete, or over 6' 6" tall... or all three. However, there are a few design flaws with this particular model. Also worth noting: if your tailgate has a liner on it, I recommend removing the liner first to find the optimum locations for the screws. Otherwise you may find yourself trying to drill into an angled piece of metal, and that doesn't usually work out very well.1. Not really a design flaw, but annoying nonetheless - the first package I received was missing all the hardware and the tie-down strap, and the instructions. I contacted Amazon and had a replacement unit in less than a week, but it still shouldn't have happened, and from some other reviews, I know I'm not the only one it's happened to. The package had still been sealed, so it seems to be a quality control issue at the factory.2. The mounting screws feel very lightweight, and they didn't all match (which I again blame on QC). I'm guessing the screws are aluminum, which doesn't play nice with a steel tailgate. Aluminum is also very soft. I plan on replacing them with stainless steel screws. Also, because of the design of the tailgate on my F-150, it isn't practical to install 6 screws as the instructions specify. When I get the stainless screws, I'll get a couple that are longer than the ones that came with the ladder, so I can put in all 6 of them.3. The pivot brackets have enough play in them that even with the tie-down strap cinched down on the ladder, the pivot points rattle quite a bit. I will also be installing some nylon washers (at the circled locations in the photo), so I can tighten the bolts down to eliminate the rattle, while still maintaining movability in the joints.4. The hitch pins (used for removing the ladder from the tailgate) are difficult to open, even for me, and I have strong hands. I have already replaced them with some different hitch pins, but I will probably just replace them with stainless steel bolts when I add the nylon washers, since I don't plan on removing the ladder anyway. Tightening the bolts will also eliminate much of the wobble that the ladder has when I'm climbing it.5. It would have been nice if the stand-offs (the vertical pieces of tubing welded to the mounting plate) were long enough so the plate could be mounted UNDER the tailgate liner. It would be more secure than mounting it on top of the liner (and it would have a cleaner look, especially if you have the ladder removed from the mounting plate). But the contoured plastic liner on my truck (and on a lot of newer trucks) is around 3/4" thick, and the stand-offs are only long enough to make that possible if the liner were no more than 1/2" thick, and even then you would have to remove the rubber bumpers from the pivot brackets. If I get really ambitious, I may decide to add longer stand-offs and re-mount the plate under the liner, but it's not currently in my plans.All in all, the ladder has a very good design, but some shoddy workmanship and implementation. The few minor improvements I've outlined here would easily make this a five-star product, and would have very little impact on the overall cost of the item, since the manufacturer buys all its parts in bulk. I'll be buying only a few of each screw, washer, etc., so it will probably cost me around $10-15 to make the changes - that's adding 25  to 40 percent to what I paid for the ladder in the first place.

Add aluminum foil to the threads before install, it helps with reception. Looks good, but the audio quality suffers from the appearance. Plus, no integrated slots or tool to tighten the antenna down. Just a smooth surface that's hard to get tight. If you grip it with pliers, you'll scratch the aluminum surface.EDIT: So after 4 months of having this item on my truck. It's now discolored and has a bronze appearance. It isn't black anymore.

You need a lot of patience when working with any kind of adhesive film or vinyl wrap-type product and this is no exclusion. I put this in my 2010 Lexus IS250 AWD base sedan. When I bought my car, there was some burn marks on the dash/console from the previous owner and not wanting to spend a small fortune to replace it, I decided to jewel (clear/white rhinestone strips) it up with another product I got from another Amazon seller. Well, after a couple of New England summers, some of the stones began to fall off so when I saw this product, I opted to remove all of them which turned out to be another project in itself.Trying to line up the vinyl in a way that would best cover the console was a bit of a challenge but the biggest patience tester was cutting out the holes/openings for the buttons from the vinyl. Took me a couple of tries. There's a couple of wrinkles in the end result from the picture in the top-left corner which could be resulted from the curve of my console. I would just say, have patience and a lot of time to work with it.

I installed this item on my 2012 JK. I wanted to make sure they where straight, so I used painter's tape to mark the locations before I pulled the backing tape. I measured down 4 inches from the top of the doors to mark the bottom of the vents and placed the tape for my mark. I was happy with the way it turned out. I would buy again.

Waiting till I had used the for 3 tanks before writing this. Using in a 2011 LML Duramax. Wasn't until I was halfway through the 2nd tank that I noticed the benefits. I'm halfway through my 3rd tank now and still noticeable. Fuel mileage increased by 2.5mpg, truck is noticeably smoother, fells a little peppier, and cranks the moment you touch the key. And my injector balance rates are much better! I had two injectors reading around -2.0, but not anymore! Balance rates are great for a truck with over 140,000 miles! I will continue to use XPD in every tank after seeing these improvements! Was using stanadyne before and this is noticeably better!

The frame I was shipped had one of the four mounting areas on the back coming loose with the rubber seal partially deformed/melted (see picture in gallery).  Not very happy considering how much these frames cost from WeatherTech.

I am only a home enthusiast weekend car detailer and RAIN is the only professional grade prep/coating product I have used thus far for my vehicles.  So far so good.  I like the products and they have superior water beading ability compared to something you would purchase at a department or auto parts store.  I have been very impressed with ALL the Nanoskin products I have purchased.  They are top quality products.  I preprepared the glass as directed on the packaging and applied RAIN as directed.  Great water beading capability and easier to clean my glass on my weekend car wash sessions from before when it was not coated in the RAIN.  If you want a good quality "coating" product for the glass on your vehicles, give RAIN a try.  You will like the results.

Really wish I could give this a higher rating because I Love the heavy duty material and workmanship on the seams of this seat cover but there are two major flaws in this otherwise high quality product:  #1, as you can see in the pic I attached, this cover's dimensions are nowhere near adequate to cover my Ford F250 pickup's rear seat.  It falls a good 2 inches+ short on either side.  #2, the flimsy security straps could have been made so much better by the manufacturer.  These elastic bands are pretty much trashed after the first couple of car rides if you have dogs like I have (and most of us do) that move around on the back seat, standing, laying down, sitting on the edges by the window, etc.  I'm not disappointed enough to send this back - it is still a good, rugged cover for the price but, I expect I will need to reinforce the straps very soon to keep the cover from sliding around.

Used on my 10k x20 winch. Worked great for a $25 cover. Turn the emblem to the back and works great. Relaced the cheap rope with 550 cord and the zip tied one corner just for added security. Works great. Don't believe what the others are saying about it not working or blowing off if they can't secure a winch cover. Probably don't need to be working a winch. Just saying

Damaged in several areas.  You could not tell from the outside of the box.  But once I took it out of the box and saw a few plastic pieces fall on the floor I was devastated... I had seen a few report of folks that had received it and had similar damage.  I was really hoping that it would not be my case... no such luck.Love everything I see in this cooler... size, construction, love it!  But very disappointing to have received one with damages... argghhhh....Packing and returning tomorrow...

way cheaper than $18 each at BMW! Save yourself money and do it yourself. If you call around to see if shops will do it (even BMW 'certified' ones, they will charge up upwards to $150.I paid a local kid from the technical college $30 to install mine, he mainly just wanted to do it for the experience.The hardest part of the task was removing the engine cover.

The lights themselves have been quite bright, and I like the design.  I had some trouble getting the screw to go into the nut as it isn't fixed.  My biggest issue, however is one of the two lights now has a considerable amount of water and moisture inside.  I will be asking for a replacement.*Update: received free replacement, also not water proof, noticed water seeping into other light.  I am in the process of asking for a different model.

This fit my 2012 S60 perfectly. The item arrived sooner than promised, well packaged. I removed the remnants of the old sticker. The blue portion is a separate sticker. There is a stiff metal piece that attached the emblem to the grille. Make sure you remove all the remaining glue residue and clean it before placing the new one. I used Goo Gone and then rubbing alcohol to remove the Goo Gone residue. The adhesive is very strong and will hold up very well. I would absolutely buy again.

Seems like it was working good when I bought it, but now I don't like it.  I have had it for almost a year. Does not dry my cars very well, leaves them wet.  I have never found a good substitute to the real chamois.  See the before and after pictures, and that's because my vehicle was not even that wet.  I don't know of it's because of the humid climate I live in, but I never had a problem with the real chamois.  I agree with another reviewer that's it's more like a sponge.

I was specifically looking for a low/high beam combo for my 2004 Accord, and these are amazing. I mean, they are bright. I feel like the low beam is probably close to what normal halogen high beam is like (lumens output wise), and I'm not sure if I'll ever need to use the high beam. Compared to HIDs I had, which were unreliable, these have been working well for the past 6 months since I got them.

I installed this leveling kit on my 2001 dodge 1500. If you disconnect the top sway bar joint you don't need a spring compressor on the passenger side. This was a super easy install. What a difference it made. The metric tired I'm running now are equal to 32 3/4 x 11. I'm sure I could run 35s if I wanted.Update after approx 100 miles after install No death wobble, drives and handles great. At this price it's a no brainier.

I'm pretty happy with these LED.  I bought a pair to replace the license plate lights on my 2011 Sorento (1 had burned out).  The LED bulbs are somewhat shorter than the ones being replaced, but all I had to do was squeeze the metal contacts a little closer together (about 1/2 an inch) and the LEDs fit fine.  However, one of them was defective so I ordered another set and returned the first set for free (thank you, Amazon Prime!).As you can see in the photo, the LED (on the left) is much, much brighter than the OEM bulb.

I bought the set of 12 lights to mount under my jeep for rock lights. I needed these to light in front of and behind each tire for off-roading at night so I can see obstacles up close.The high end competitor charges 10x the price for rock lights so I figured for 20 bucks is give these a try.The lights themselves seemed very well sealed. The wires are very thin coming out of the light but the are very low watt lights so that should work.Install was very straight forward. Drill a hole and stick light through like sticking a bolt through. I made some aluminum brackets for some of the bulbs to get the angle rightWhen I turned them all on I was blown away by how much light they put out.Have driven in the rain with them and no water entry into the bulb which is great.Very pleased so far.I will update if there are any failures.

I ordered it a while back it got here fast. Just now got to putting them on .Well they are 2 different parts 1 is the right part the other is different .The numbers on the box are the same .Plus I waited to long to return it. Oh well my loss I need to stop ordering parts in advance. Cause It seems people can't get the right parts in the right boxes ran into the same thing with brake lines they wanted to charge me to send them back..not for sure if the lines where this sell but they said front and there where the back ones or visa versa .they were also ACDelco..In the pic the one on the right is the one that got replaced with the right one Pic all by its self is the wrong one..

I mounted these on the front of my truck by mounting them to my deer bars (after market), and they're awesome at night. I use them exclusively on my farm at night, never on the road. In fact, I think flipping these on on the road or highway would be illegal, as they're THAT BRIGHT. Really, everything is illuminated with these lights on.Mounting them was very straight forward: they have a rocker assembly that you can mount first, before attaching the actual lights to the rocker assembly. The look and feel of these lights is completely black ops and rugged. They are filled with high-power LEDs, which is what makes them so incredibly bright.One final note: I've only run them with the truck running, now knowing exactly how much juice they're sucking out. As they're LED, it's probably not that much, but I haven't tried to kill the battery just yet.Having received these as a free sample, and agreeing to offer this objective and unbiased review, I can't see a single reason to deduct even one star from this review. They're that good.

Upon closer inspection, It's obvious this light fixture was originally designed for use with 194 incandescent bulbs. These  fixtures have been refitted with LED panels. In my opinion, the new LED panels are under-designed. There is room for additional LEDs inside the large light housings. The Cost to add a few more LEDs would have been minimal. The plastic light covers on this item are carryovers from the old incandescent units and make absolutely no sense on this LED-equipped model. There is a big 'magnifier' area in the center of the cover designed to amplify the light from a 194 incandescent bulb. This cover is totally useless and out of place with the flat panel LED array. A cover specifically designed for the LED panel would yield better light output and even light distribution. As another reviewer mentioned, this fixture is large and it hangs down off the ceiling 1/2" lower than the fixture it replaced. (depth is 1 3/4") If someone using the RV is 'just' clearing the lights now, that extra 1/2" of depth could be a problem.Current draw for this fixture is only about .315 amp at 12.8 volts. (A standard incandescent unit would draw about 2 amps at 12.8 volts.)The Starlights is a very efficient light!IMO the light output of this unit is just 'adequate'. The fixture is constructed of heavy plastic. Looks like it should hold up well. There is an added bonus with this fixture - an easily accessible compartment that could be used to store small 'valuables' like rings, cash, etc.EDIT: I added a 'customer image' of the light with the covers removed to better illustrate what I was trying to say. You'll have to find that 'other thing' on your own.

Very nice cover!  I was looking for a good quality cover that didn't cost an arm and a leg, and I found just that.  I bought this to cover my 1957 Chevy Bel Air.  I got tired of this southern pollen covering my clean car, as well as the ordinary dust that collects on a vehicle that is kept under an open-air carport.  I live in a rural area, and it's not uncommon for the neighbor's cat to walk all over it either. I like the slick  texture of the material, and it seems to be very well made.  Nice and thick.  I believe this is one of Leader's premium covers, as it's  constructed with 7 layers.  The silver color is cool looking and doesn't collect a lot of heat when the afternoon sun shines on it.  Always a plus for any vehicle, especially a classic.I ordered the cover and another for my 2015 GMC Sierra while I was at work, and I returned home to find them waiting for me.  I couldn't wait to clean the vehicles and get them covered.  Both covers fit well and were easy to install.  I had help from my daughter covering the vehicles, as I didn't want to risk the cover dragging the ground, picking up grit, and possibly scratching the paint.  However, I could easily install the cover by myself, as long as the wind isn't too high.  The included straps make it easy to secure it in windy conditions.If you're looking for a nice cover that carries a reasonable price tag, then I can recommend checking out what Leader has to offer.  I was surprised how many sizes and types of covers they offer for all sorts of vehicles.  There is a cover for just about anything you drive.I received this product at a discount in return for my honest, unbiased review.

I used this for a rather unusual project:  Our white enameled cast iron kitchen sink was getting scratched and worn and tired-looking, so I polished the bottoms of the bowls with Cerium Oxide and felt pads as I do for scratched auto glass.  Then I sealed it with TFS to bring out the shine and protect it. The results were good and I'm hoping the shine lasts a long time..... we'll see.  It is hard to show well in photos, but I've attached a before and after comparison.Hoping to try it on my cars next!!!!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!!!!IF YOU GET CLEAR LIQUID OUT OF THE BOTTLE AFTER SHAKING IT WELL, put the bottle in a sink full of hot water for a while to get it good and warmed up and shake well again.  You may have to do this more than once!If the bottle won't "shake" any more because the contents have foamed up, carefully try to "burp" the bottle in case it has an air pocket inside it.  If the person who wrote the 1-Star review had read this, they might not have had the bad experience they had with this product!My third photo shows what the product looked like after heating and shaking twice.UPDATE:My second project with this product is about as unusual as the first.  We have a solar-powered swimming pool skimmer and the two 12v solar panels were looking dull and scruffy-looking.  I took the surface "scuz" off using fine auto polishing compound, then used the TFS on them..... it really brought them back to life!  They look and feel like glass now, like new panels or better, and this is a really old unit.  The 4th and 5th pix show the difference between the TFS-treated panel (left panel) and the untreated one.  You can see reflection of the sky on the left panel in the 4th photo, and reflections on the closer (left) panel in the 5th photo.  (Again, hard to really show well in pix).  This unit will be in the sun all the time so should be a good test of the longevity of the TFS!ANOTHER UPDATE:My son bought a bottle of TFS and used it on his black Silverado pickup truck.  His latest comment:"I just did my first car wash thanks to an unexpected rain the other day.  Gotta say, I'm ready to throw out all my waxes- it's that much better!The water beaded up great and made drying the truck much faster. It also seemed easier to wash since the surface is so smooth.Afterwards it feels just as slick as before.I hope it lasts for months as stated, I hand applied it since I didn't have my little buffer here.Pretty cool stuff!"

These are my go-to connectors for wiring up accessories on vehicles. I have used these on both my truck and ATV and they haven't failed me yet. My ATV routinely sees mud and water and the seals on these connectors have not leaked. I use a dab of dielectric grease before I assemble these so that may help, but I would do that for any connector. My latest project for these was a custom harness I made to put bed lights and reverse lights in my new truck. Each leg of the harness got its own connector so I can swap out lights if they burn out. They have been under the truck for months without an issue. If you need simple and cheap 2 wire connectors at a good price, I reccomend these.

Excellent rack for the money.  This fits my 10ft recreational sit on top Kayak perfectly.  I like the fact that when attached to Yakima round bars, it does allow for forward and backward movement so you can adjust it to perfectly fit the contours of your Kayak hull.Only negative was that the top foam padding was hard to adjust initially, but after spraying some WD-40 where it attaches to the bar, I was able to easily slide it up to adjust to my Kayak's height.Overall, it's a very sturdy and stable rack for you Kayak.

Okay, full disclosure, I live in San Diego so the weather is nice 90% of the time, so I can't vouch for bad weather usage.That said, this retro reflective tape exceeded my expectations.  Once I figure out to remove both the sticky side and the clear side of the tape, it confirmed to every bend I wanted it to.  I used it to outline the fenders of my motorcycle. The black, while not as black as my bike, offered a nice subtle contrasting pinstripe look.  I would, without hesitation recommend this product.

This is my second pair of cougar motors leds (f150 and now my impala) and this has definitely been my best amazon purchase this year. I was tired of the old amber color of oem bulbs and I had HIDs before and they weren't the easiest. The fans are so quite in the assemblys i forgot they even had fans. ( my f150s are noticeable when the engines off ) but in my impala they fit under the dust covers and I tucked the wires in there and it sealed up perfectly.Theres a reason why these are sponsored in the search results. They are worth it.

Firstly, I have owned Weathertech floor mats in the past and really think they are high quality.  That being said, I'm a little disappointed with the floor liner.  In general, they are pretty flimsy and do not fit the cabin as tightly as they should and appear to in the photos. I'm wondering if I'm better off with their floor mats.Front drivers seat: There are no positive fasteners as advertised in the image.  You use the existing fasteners and two clips that attach to them which have velcro on the top.  This does make for easy installation, but it allows the mat to move around a little.  Not enough that I ever really notice it when getting in and out or while driving.Front Passenger seat:  The fasteners on the passenger side were difficult to get into the rug and did not simply twist in as the instruction indicate.  I ended up using pliers to lift the carpet up so that I could screw in the fasteners.  While the front floor liners have a fairly good fit I did expect them to be a little sturdier and fit more snugly.  I took them out today to clean them for the first time and even though I held the fastener and gently pulled the floor mat up the velcro was removed.  I assume these mats are meant to be removed for cleaning periodically and this was the very first time and the velcro came off.The rear liner feels even more flimsy (basically because it is larger and cannot hold its own weight) and does not have nearly as tight of a fit.  I have the Sony soundsystem with the subwoofer under the rear seats and expected the cutout to be a little more perforated and a tighter fit around the subwoofer, but after cutting it I realized I should have removed only a little at first and continued to re-cut as needed for a snug fit.  If you cut anywhere near the lifted ridge you will have a lot of spare room around the subwoofer.  The mat does not lay flat around most of the edges, expect to get some debris under the mat and a spill could drip onto the carpet near the doors.  I have included pictures below and actually think they make it look better than it does in person.Now...this all being said...I gave these 3 stars because...- Primarily, they are meant to protect your carpet and keep it clean and under most conditions they will do just that- I might be a little harsh with my review because I have come to expect very high quality from WeatherTech and these miss the bar a little.- I expected them to be more rigid and have a tighter fit and aesthetically I think they could look better- I was disappointed with the subwoofer cutout and instructionsI am still glad I purchased them and do not plan to return them unless I come across another brand which has overcome these issues.  I think the mat is worth purchasing but 200 is a little steep for something that is not more refined.Update: 7/17/15 After living with these a little while longer I would have to say that I am pleased with the front mats.  They are staying in place and do their job well.  As for the rear floorliners I am less impressed.  They do slide around, are flimsy (much more so than the front ones) do not fit great by the doors and I find it hard to believe they are custom for this vehicle.  They actually curl up by the doors and are a hazard for people getting in.  I may have to just go without them and get some solid rubber mats in place of these floorliners.  I am pretty disappointed with these.

These are good LEDs.  The WHITE is extremely bright and was a VAST IMPROVEMENT over the previous switch back bulbs I had installed.  The only down side is the flashing color - it is YELLOW and NOT AMBER.  The colors shown in the picture are accurate of how YELLOW they are...I anticipated they would be more ORANGE based upon AMBER being in the description.They do switch nicely and the WHITE remains completely OFF when using the YELLOW which is preferable (some others I've used seem to quickly cycle between the two colors when flashing).  There is a small time delay with the light completely OFF when returning to WHITE from YELLOW which I prefer in a switch back bulb.Overall pleased with the purchase; 4 stars for the YELLOW vs. AMBER turn color.

I was a little skeptical when I bought this because it was so cheap.  When it arrived, I decided to take the glass plate off and silicone the inside around the edges to help protect against moisture.  I then put all the screws back on and installed it.  It has worked flawlessly since.  It is so bright it makes my Jeep high beams look silly.  I would definitely purchase this again.

I used this is place a new camshaft seal in my Honda B18B1 engine, as pictured. I put the cam cap bolts back on finger tight, then 15 minutes later I tightened the 4 bolts on it. I start the car's engine 45 minutes later and drive for 10 minutes. The next day, I didn't notice any oil go past the RTV gasket.Unlike Hondabond (with 2 different packages), the Threebond package didn't rip open on the bottom, on the first time of use.

Lasted two years (to within one day) see attached purchase history photo.  Great low price, Lightning fast shipping. Would have given 5 stars if they lasted three years or more.  It's not a difficult replacement, but you have to take off front bumper / grille to change the headlights on a 2007 Prius. You Tube shows you how.

Purchased Truck Lite Phase 7 headlamps and driving lights.  Kuryakyn says this fits this headlamp, which it does not.  There is no way to completely tighten it down.  With the ring tightened down to its max without taking a chance on breaking the bolt, you're still able to turn the ring with little force.  Problem is, there are no other rings to buy, this is it.  Kuryakyn does not make this ring without these stupid grooves.  If Truck-Lite reduce the depth 5/8", you could use the stock smooth chrome ring.I'll give this a few long rides and see if the ring vibrates causing the mounting screw to move its downward position.  If it does, will return the headlamps and ring.  When you're buying the best, you expect workmanship and when so many reviews are saying the same damn thing, is anyone home at Kuryakyn or Truck-Lite that cares?

I've used similar products, including the 3M Matte Black Vinyl, and other than not being an exact color match to 3M, I can't find any flaws with this VViViD matte black vinyl.I used this to cover panels on my motorcycle, along with a product called&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Knifeless-Finish-Line-Vinyl-Wrap-Cutting-Tape-50-Meter-Roll-164-Ft-for-Stripes-and-More/dp/B007XY5K6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Knifeless Finish Line Vinyl Wrap Cutting Tape 50 Meter Roll (164 Ft) for Stripes and More</a>&nbsp;to cut a perfect outline for the panels I was covering, without having to risk cutting into my paint.  I also used a torch to heat the vinyl slightly and stretch around curved areas to get it to lay totally flat without stretch marks or deformations.  It seemed to go on the exact same way as the 3M vinyl, but for way cheaper.I was a little bummed that I couldn't use it to patch an area where I tore through 3M vinyl on my tank, but I wasn't really expecting that the colors from different manufacturers would match exactly.  Overall, if you're looking to do a small vinyl wrapping job, this product works awesome.

I am very happy with this Z06 Stage 1 splitter!  It includes the necessary instructions and hardware (10 rivets) just as it does from the parts counter, only it's been painted in Carbon Flash.  The paint work looks great and I could not find any flaws in the visible portions.  Fitment and installation were both spot-on; exactly as I would expect from a factory piece.  Installation was quick and easy.  It reused 12 existing bolts, then you have to drill 10 small holes to use the supplied rivets.  It was my first time ever using a rivet gun (which I bought for only $5), but the process could not have been easier.

These did not fit my 2008 Subaru Outback 2.5i as noted.  The terminals that attach to the coil are too short and of a different design, so they simply do not stay attached. Picture is of the OE terminal on the left and the NGK terminal on the right, both fully extended within the boot as expected.  Check your connectors before you purchase as these are not compatible with all the models shown, and avoid wasting your time and money.

This was a direct replacement of my trailers factory 5 (4+ground) wire plug. All the wires were long enough to run new if needed but i only had to go the end of the Tongue. The only thing i had to keep was the original white wire for the ground since it was short (3 feet?) and mine was grounded at the end of the trailer tongue (see pics)

The cover had like a wax coating that flaked off and turned my hands green while I was removing the cover. Whatever coating was on the material just flaked off. It fit just right, with exception of the mirrors, but it was a good fit overall.The flaking green stuff was odd, and I held my breath, to keep from inhaling it.I have never had a cover chemical come off on my hands.It feels like wax and now I can see through the cover.Companies should have to make good for poor quality products, like this.I give it one star because it fit just right, with exception of the mirrors, but it was a good fit overall, but I wasted my money.

This was ordered for a 2000 Olds Alero, drivers front. I took apart the old one only to find the original one was different, there was an additional rod that connects to a non serviceable part on the actuator. After some research, it turns out this actuator is for a vehicle without anti theft. I could not find any place/parts store that had this actuator. I did more research & per AC delco parts website, you can remove the rod & can use this actuator.  just disconnected the rod from the latch & it slides out of the actuator. I put it together & it works just fine, no issues.1st pic shows the actuator with the rod still in it, 2nd pic shows the rod removed.

After recommendations from other riders, I got a can to see for myself.  I don't know how much is actually cleans the parts I use it on (I gave the bike a proper bath prior to application), but it sure makes the parts I use it on look great.  I have a fair amount of wrinkle black parts that pig spit gave a very nice shine to.  I also used it on my rubber fork gaiters, as well as my plastidipped fairing with good results.  Seems that it is fairly resistant to dust as well, because while my flat black paint is showing signs of dust, the parts coated with pig spit continue to shine!In the picture, the only really clear things you can see are the fairing and fork lowers, which are wrinkle black.

I have used a few different types of cold Air Intakes like aFe, KNN etc... This intake system fits perfect with no mods or tweaking needed, its quality built and doesnt feel cheap, the instructions are in color plus it gives you order number should you need to replace anything. I am very impressed.I have no review on milage increase or decreases nor have I towed with it yet. But just buy seat of the pants feel, feels like I lost a little torque on the low to mid but whoa, right at about 2300 RPM hang on it really kicks in and pulls. Dont get me wrong it pulls very hard all through the band just much more in the top end vs the stock filter. It did not make my turbo any louder or my exhaust on normal driving. But when I put the pedal to the medal, man my truck sounds good. So far I like the system and am impressed with craftsmen ship and attention to detail.(note: this is installed on an 2006, Ford F350 FX4, with 81K miles, head studded, exhaust 4in turbo back, SCT tuner running the performance can tune 3:73 gearing, bullet proofed.)UPDATE: 8/2016Now that I have towed using this system I have to say it works well. The low end torque loss really was not a factor while towing. I have towed  several different loads with this intake, 6,000, 10,000 and 15,500 pounds and have towed them all with no problems. I spoke with several mechanics regarding this upgrade and the majority stated there is no real improvement and I now run the risk of dusting my turbo. Well, having put about 20K miles on my truck with this filter system my turbo and the intake take tubes are spotless. And yes I am that anal that I check to see if there is any dusting. I clean my filter every 3K miles whether it needs it or not and after I return from a trip towing heavy. It is nice having the added airflow at the higher rpm range and notice my truck does run better while towing overall. Also it's much much easier to get to the filter to clean vs paying for an entire new stock filter every 3K miles. Over all I am still very happy with this intake and still recommend it. I wish I could comment on EGT's while towing but I purchased this system before I did any significant towing. All of my previous towing experiences were with 4-5K pound loads on my stock filter. In that load range I really have not seen a big difference. But I am also running a 4 inch exhaust from the turbo back which really helps keep the egt's down. I apologize for the long post and hope this helps who ever reads my ramblings come to a decision.

These things are just plain awesome. What you get for the price you pay makes these an incredible deal. I bought my first pair to rig some lights on my sons Raptor 80, since they don't come with headlights. A simple wire harness, relay, and a switch later, he had all kinds of light beaming from the front of his quad. That gave me the idea to see how these would fit in place of the Baja lights on my Bombardier DS650X. Turns out, they fit absolutely perfectly, they mount well, and they are a massive improvement over the OEM lights. I'm pretty happy, and I'll be even happier when I get the LED bulbs to replace the stock headlights now. Highly recommended product right here.

Shipping arrived five days early!I added the 50" Yakima wind fairing on my Smittybilt SRC roof rack.  I had to add electric tape on the front round bar so that the fairing arms can handle the wind without flipping back.I had my doubts on the product silencing the humming noise from my round roof rack but it did the job!Normally 40 mph my racks are humming like a brewing storm and at 65 mph it sounded as if the storm had arrived! I also run a soft top so you can imagine the noise being real present.Now with the fairing I've tested up to 50 mph and the soft top barely makes the typical vibrating noise and the bars are not humming. Glad I purchased it!

This oil filter is great!High quality product.Fits perfectly on my 2013 Ram 1500 5.7l V8This filter is a little bit longer, still fits, then the one i was replacing, the old one was the cheapest one possible, so i am happy that the Royal Purple will have more cleaning capacity.This is only a couple dollars extra, if i was you i would spend the little more, oil quality and maintenance is the most important thing you can do for your car.I will for sure be purchasing again.Do it.

This idler pulley quality wise is okay, it was not however installed because it is not the correct pulley for my 05 Chevy Surburban 1500 Flex.  I know some others here have modified the pulley using the speed but and spacer from the old part, but this does not give exact alignment of the serpentine belt.  If you order the correct pulley as I did the second time,  there will be no need to re use anything from the old part because it is an exact match.  I posted picture of the exact pulley to order!

Got this installed yesterday and am really loving it so far.  (put it in a 1978 Ford F-150).  Looks real nice setting on my motor.  Has a nice strong, steady idle.  Was a nice clean installation and tuned no problem.It was packaged very nicely for shipping which I was real glad to see and the price here on Amazon was about 200 dollars cheaper than our local brick-n-mortar stores wanted so I am a very happy camper.

Worth The Money, Assembles In About An Hour, Be Careful With Your First Load-Up!This dolly is very heavy-duty. If it has any weak point, I would say it's the non-metal caster-wheels. They do seem to be pretty tough, but time will tell. When you assemble this, you'll see that it's designed to last. My assembly time was just over any hour, and included inventorying the parts first (I was missing ONE lock washer).IMPORTANT: I almost learned the hard way how to properly load my 2012 Harley Ultra Classic Limited (1000+ pounds) onto this dolly. I put the dolly in front of my bike and after locking it down at each end, I pulled the bike up onto the dolly. My bike almost fell over! The rear tire was not exactly lined up with the front tire and the rear tire rubbed against the side-rail of the dolly, causing my bike to almost go over. After that near miss-hap, I figured it out. You have to place the dolly, locking it down, and then pull you bike straight up. By pulling up STRAIGHT to the dolly, your wheels are in alignment and will go onto the dolly correctly.After the bike is loaded, I left it in gear so that it would not move on the dolly while I was pushing/pulling it where I wanted it in my garage. As so others had stated, it's easier to move it you attach a pull-strap to either ended you're wanting the pull. I used a rubberized-hooked-ratchet-strap. The rubberized hook attached easily to one of the holes on each end of the dolly, without any scratching. I was able to gain about 2 feet of room in my garage by using this dolly.

Was able to put the Combi-Cam 7803S 4-Dial Combination lock rather than have more keys.Everything was great about the box accept for 3 things.1 is the weight. Thank God I only bought the drivers seat.  It is very heavy.2 was advertisement of the harness adapter/relocationkit  for the newer jk unlimited. It sounded like a cool harness extension,  it was only 4 zip ties. Lol3 the annoying clunk you get when u accelerate and stop. My quick fix was either to add a washer, but I figure it will never be perfect. So I jammed 2 fingers of my work glove meaning sticking out of the box and it worked.Definitely recommend this product.

Value for the money this system is everything and more than I expected it to be. I originally selected this manufacture because of the variety of options the offer using the exact same source control system. As an avid Jeeper we tend to change things up often.Removing the items from the box I was impressed to find that not only was the Source Control System made of metal but so was the actual switch pod.The Source Control System has six 50 amp relays pre-installed along with four 20 amp fuses and two 30 amp fuses. All of which are replaceable in the event of failure. The cabling was nicely wrapped in wire looms and included a reset breaker to help protect my valuable accessories.The Switch Panel System included 6 high quality rocker switches and a volt meter in the middle. The switches come in three colors. For my purchase I went with green. All of the switches and voltmeter all came pre-installed into the switch panel leaving a pig tail connect to be plugged it.Additional contents in the box included a variety of 10 laser etched rocker switch covers allowing my to pick the perfect 6 for my setup, heck even an extra switch just in case. all the way down to the crimp connectors for my accessories and the zip ties to clean things up nicely.The installation was fairly simple and VERY clean. Installing the Source Control System on the drivers side of the vehicle next to the automotive computer. Running the Switch Control Connector through the firewall, up the a-pillar and across the windshield channel to the switch panel attached to the Jeeps footman loop. The only thing left was to run the power to the battery and attach the add-a-fuse to the M6 fuse spot on the Jeep. This fuse gets its power when the vehicle is turned on. So what that means is that your accessories will only operate when the key is in the on position at minimum. Some might find this a con, but if that is the case I guess you could just use a different fuse but your lights on your switches would be on constantly.All in all Im very satisfied with the installation and more importantly the value for the money. You definitely get s lot of value for your money with this product. I have seen comparable products on the market go for twice this. The company seems to put a lot of detail in ensuring that you have everything you need to get your accessories up and running fast.Check out our install video on YouTube: #BubbasGarageTv

Works better than I expected. I used this to polish the barrel, trigger, bushing, and slide lock of my pistol after sanding off the black paint. I was expecting a slightly shinier polished/brushed look but it became almost a mirror like finish. It looks a lot shinier in person when you can see the reflection at different angles. See before and after pictures. It should be obvious which is which.

Im not one to write reviews and add pictures but these bulbs deserve it. Theyre amazing for starters. Much much brighter than a standard bulb and cheaper than most anything else. I only had one issue with them and that was they're a bit too long so they don't fit in my license plate light sockets too well but thats vehicle specific. I have them in my 2002 Silverado 2500HD. Aside from the fittment issue I have no complaints. 10/10 bulbs light up and work. I was skeptical about getting led bulbs but am already looking at doing the rest of my truck.

I cannot state enough, how great a piece of equipment this is! After my safety gear, this may be the best investment I've made. Where to start? There really are just so many great features.First off, weight distribution. I cannot state this enough and I believe no one really stresses this enough. Grab any backpack, store 5 bottles of water with your basic trail or long term adventure ride needs and you'll by packing lightly, have at least a 20lb pack; and on your back, 20lbs will wear you down fast, maybe even knock you off balance if items shift suddenly. Throw the same items in this vests' 12 pockets, add an extra 15lbs in gear, throw it on and you'll notice the difference right away. It'll actually feel light because the weight is so nicely distributed. Now you won't have room for 5 bottles of water but...You will have room for a hydration pack, it comes with a 70oz pack. For me, enough on most trail rides, but the pocket will fit something maybe 2.5 times the size. This in itself is a great advantage, not having to take your helmet off, backpack off, etc. to take a drink but simply take the tube, bite firmly and suck on like a straw and boom! You're golden. Not to mention, I feel like in the event of an accident, at least a minor one, the pack will provide some cushion.The front pockets leave me with plenty of room for a utility knife, extra spark plugs, camera, GoPro gear (extra mounts, extra screws, etc.), my wallet, keys, small flashlight, some protein bars and a sandwich.The three rear pockets are huge! I store an extra pair of gloves as well as an actual case for my GoPro with some extra accessories. One of these is intended for tools, however, I feel this may not be a great idea unless you have no other choice. My bikes have tool bags, I'd rather leave the stuff that can injure me on the bike and not on my body in the case of an accident. All of this... and I've got a few empty pockets.Fit is very adjustable I wear over Fox Titan armor with room to spare, so don't worry about it.This thing is awesome, no lies. It just looks cool too and that don't hurt it much either.

Oops!  First time I replaced it, I was rushing and tapped it in too far.  Had to order a second because there's no way to remove it without wrecking it (use drywall screws or a strong pick to pull it out).  If the seal is seated too deep, you're guaranteed oil leaks.  My advice, get a piece of PVC pipe (or like I did, grab the drain cover from your landscape drain!), put the wrecked old seal on the end and use that to firmly and evenly tap the new one in to place.  Should be flush with the surface.  Even if you wreck the new one, it's worth it to get another and do it right because dropping the transmission and removing the clutch and flywheel again is not worth it!

I typically buy AFE intakes, but the 2016 Durango R/T has some changes from previous years. With K&N being the only option without modification, K&N it was. In my opinion, the K&N was built better with clearer instructions for removing stock parts than any of my last three AFE intakes. I also found the silicone couplers to be higher quality. Install was a breeze, under 15 minutes for me. Sound is great, and I don't expect much more than that. Modern intakes are typically just fine for quite a bit more power over stock, but noisemaker or not I like them.

I've opened a lot of filters over the years. This filter appears to be less than quality. It has cardboard end caps, and the clearance from the cardboard to the filter wall is very minimal. The bypass valve isn't bad (the same style Mobil1 Extended Performance filters use) but it's not  great.

This bag system is really three bags in one. The main compartment is roomy enough to hold 2-3 days of clothes. The additional tool bag that clips on is enough for a single day trip. And the side pockets are more storage than your average sissy bar bag.I really like the buckles. They look like classic straps, but they are hidden quick release. Awesome idea.Finally the straps for a backpack are a cool idea. The luggage I had used was bulky and unwieldy when carrying. I'm looking forward to filing this bag full and hiking on my next long ride.The adjustable straps make it easy to mount on the sissy bar back and I used some bungees to make it tight.

This thing just turned out to be worth it's weight in gold. I've had my new Vulcan S about two weeks and we just had a hail storm.  I guess because it's fabric is so new it's still strong; it kept the hail off my bike.  I haven't anchored it down to the concrete but it stayed down (maybe being wet helped?). Wow. Grateful I had it out there.

This vent cap was a direct replacement for the old one on my 2004 RV.  I didn't need to replace the base, just the cap itself.  The Arizona sun ruined the plastic cap after 8 years.  I am saving the base, in case I need to replace it later.  The cap installs over 4 sets of dual locating pins (8 pins total) on the base, with a screw mount to hold it in place.  If you have this type of vent, it is a piece of cake to change the cap.  I found no photos of the locating pins on this vent anywhere online, so check your vent first to make sure it is the right one.  If I would have needed to change the base, as well, that would have been straightforward, as it attaches with 6 screws and some sealant.  If you are installing this vent as a new install, it should be easy.  I resealed all of the screws and edges with Dicor 501LSW self-leveling RV roof sealant (also great stuff), and I am confident this should last for years.  I was so happy with this vent, I bought a spare.  Check out my photos of the unpackaged product in the intro, and read my photo captions for more details.

Excellent shocks for the price. I recently purchased a 2003 Sierra with 94,000 miles. The truck is in great condition overall, but as you can imagine its sat quite a bit so some things needed tending to. My rear shocks were very rusty (well, for a southern vehicle) and this truck had a bed shutter on highway speeds and very bad upon braking at nearly any speed above 35. (The rotors and pads are fine)Upon replacing these my shake was immediately resolved and my rear end stopped sagging. Truck rides, brakes and tows great now! For everyday driving with an empty bed I run 55 psi.Towing (usually around 4500 lbs) I run 150 psi.This kit does include the air line kit.

Edit: Unfortunately this is a poor company.  While the description is obviously in error, customer service fell way short. Only contact is email exchange, where they refused to take any responsibility even after providing pictures and measurements. I ordered based on their description, but Im required to ship it back to them at my cost, for a 20lb jack, thats a poor solution.  Caveat emptor, I suppose.Will avoid doing business with them in the future.Very sturdy well made jack that tucks up very close underneath when the jack is retracted.  Attachment bracket is a dead on match to the holes in the trailer, too.But the description is in error.  Its not 10 from the bottom bracket to the top of the jack, its more like 18.  Which means my tail gate will hit if I drop it. If that makes a difference for your application, keep that in mind.  Unfortunately, Ill have to return it.

Works as described. Pretty simple installation. Some people have complained about it digging into their dash. I was VERY careful while installing this in my 2016 Jeep Wrangler JK. I have not removed it though either to see if it did dig into the dash. It does exactly what it advertises and holds my phone perfectly. Made taking some trail videos using my iPhone 6S easy. Its in a perfect place for me to easily reach when i need to touch my phone, etc. Great product. Love the ability to easily take photos and videos off my phone. See attached for a picture i was able to snag using the mount.

These are very heavy duty (and heavy)The only thing I don't like so much is that the circular loop is so wide that the filter housing doesn't fit it, the water connections actually sit on the loop. It'd be nice if the loop was a little smaller and the filter housings wider end sat on the loop (so as not to potentially mess with connections or threadings) - other than that, it's solid and heavy - likely need a mallet to hammer it into the ground.I am using this with the Flow Pur dual RV filter.I bought two of these stands and hammered them into the ground side by side with a rubber mallet, then set the filter unit in it. It keeps the filter about 3" off the ground if the legs are driven all the way in to the cross brace support.Aesthetically it could be cooler looking, and I still think the rings should fit to the filter body but it is functional and sturdy and not expensive.

First things first. Don't bother trying to apply these products by hand. Get a dual action, variable speed polishing wheel. The dual action / oscillating version will be much less likely to burn the get coat and you can use higher speeds. I use one from Harbor Freight... $70 works great. Used it with their velcro attached foam pads, $7 each. Used a total of 9 of them.The Meguiars Polish doesn't replenish the gel coat very well, IMO. Substitute with a $3 bottle of baby oil and wheel it in good. You will practically hear your boat say "thank you" as it is applied. The color will deepen tremendously (MUCH more than with the Meguiars Polish). Results will be far superior and save money. I know it might sound strange, but baby oil is the polish to use. Seal it in with at least two coats of wax. People will think you took it to a pro.The attached picture is for real. The red and dark blue on my 27 year old Powerquest look amazing and I get told the boat looks only a couple years old.1) Cutting compound / oxidation remover applied with polishing wheel2) Baby oil as polish applied with polishing wheel3) Wax applied with polishing wheel4) Wax again with polishing wheel

Perfect for my application. Voltage reads nearly the same as a VOM, slightly low. Just right for me, like setting a clock 10 minutes fast so you're never late. I'll see the voltage a bit lower than it actually is, with time to 'spare' when it comes to needing charged.

The photo shown in this listing is wrong.  What is shown is a muffler clamp or pipe clamp.  What is actually offered for sale is a rain cap typically used on the exhaust pipe that is mounted vertically.  It fits a 1-1/4" pipe diameter.The rain cap is exactly what I needed for my International Harvester tractor.Do a search on Walker Exhaust 35512 Hardware-Rain Cap to see what this product actually looks like.

This was a great light kit at a good price. The installation was easy if not tedious. 12 strands is a lot of light, and a lot of wires. Get ready for some minor ingenuity and some stuffing, zipties, and extra 3M adhesive (although it does have some extra included). The lights are bright, and the colors are all very attractive. Check your local laws for what you can ride with, and how they have to be installed, if you plan on riding pretty.

Installed on 2017 Colorado LS Crew Cab,one man job can't go wrong. Very cool looking something different than from what is out there. If my 08 Ram didn't already have some on it I would definitely get these for it. Easy to follow instructions. Like other buyer noted they blend in real well with Trucks O.E.Molding.

What a simple thing to make right, but when it's wrong it's wrong. The partition that's in one of the large spots is misaligned so only one of the two button snaps will work at a time. See the misalignment of snaps by my thumb. I'm probably not going to send it back because I don't want the hassle of reboxing and waiting. Quality control apparently missed this and it can't be repaired without another snap to put in the correct spot. Other than that it seems good and what I want for organization in suv.

Tried this after reading how bad other off the shelf tire dressings are for your tires !  Particularly if you have an RV where tires last longer than 3-4 years, you'll want this water based dressing as it does not lead to sidewall cracking. Lots of info on the internet about this, so pretect your investment, This gallon goes a heck of a long way !

It does not agree with the published (attached image 1) with the received article (image 2), although they work but the car detects them as if they were damaged (in image 1 it appears as compatible but apparently it is not 100%), causing the Flash frequency for directionals be greater and shorter. I do not return it because it is more expensive to return it (final destination Colombia) than to buy others.

So simple to install. It took about 30 minutes total. I ended up running the cable down and out one of the rubber grommets near the driver side tail light. Here's a picture for size reference. Carpeting doesn't need to come up to do the install. Simply pull the side panels off and then unclip the wire connections. The instructions say to remove the tail lights but that's not really necessary. I just fit my hand back behind the panel and unclipped the connectors.Note: The longest part of the wire goes to the passenger side and the shorter one on the driver. I zip tied the control box to some existing wires inside the vehicle to prevent outside corrosion.There is a little storage container on the passenger side panel that won't come out until you remove the plastic fastener in the bottom. To remove it just press the very middle of the fastener with a nail or small screwdriver towards the floor and the entire assembly will come out after that.

I am very impressed with the quality and fit of these hubcaps on my 2002 VW Jetta, especially considering the low cost.  They fit snuggly and securely and seat with a solid click when you send them home with the palm of your hand.  Be sure you have the retainer ring in the correct position (it fits in grooves towards the end of the clips) and you should have no problems.  Make sure the cutout is positioned at the valve stem.  I would recommend these wheel covers to anyone.

Easy to install with instructions and all hardwareIncluded.  Reinforces the bumper to prevent failure when traveling especially with gear attached.  I noticed my bumper had loose welds and rot on bottom after returning from my last trip.  Only noticed as bike rack seemed loose when unpacking.  Could have lost my bumper, bikes , rack and caused an accident if my trip was longer.  I put on a new bumper and these supports so now can feel safe towing .  Install took less than one hour using drill, clamps and 1/2 inch socket.

At first I was going to use these LEDs for my Brake Lights, but I couldn't get the dual filament action to work.  They would come one when I turn the running lights on, but they wouldn't brighten when I pressed the brakes.  I tried them with my rear turn signals too, and that didn't work, they just hyper flashed and the indicator light on the dash for whichever bulb I installed, stayed on.  I am pretty sure that this is actually an issue with my light sockets, and not the LEDs since I have also tried 3 different manufacture's LEDs and the same results each time.  I am going to try and swap out the sockets and maybe add an inline resistor to the circuit and see if that helps me any.Anyways, since I was unable to use them for my brake lights or turn signals, I decided to see if they would work for my reverse lights.  I have tried sever different brands of LEDs in my reverse lights, but have always went back to the incandescent bulbs.  I have 20% window tint on all of the windows in my 2005 Chevy Colorado Crew Cab, so at night I need some decent reverse lights.  All the LEDs I have tried this far have never been bright enough, so I couldn't see very well out my back window.  I had noticed that these were a lot brighter than the incandescent bulbs, when I was fooling around with the brake lights, which is why I decided to use them for my reverse lights.  They work perfectly for this purpose, now I actually have a set of LEDs that I can see with at night.  I like the color temperature a lot better also compared to the incandescent 3500K, these are about a 5500K when comparing them to other 5000K and 6000K LEDs, though not the 6000K that the description says they are still a nice white color, with no yellow.The bulbs them selves are very well manufactured, they seem to be more durable than other LEDs I have purchased.  A few key notes, with them compared to others on the markets, First they have only 3 LED Plates (2 Sides and 1 Top) compared to the 5-9  (4-8 sides, and 1 top) on other bulbs.  This works in their favor though, as there is an aluminum head sink between the two side plates dissipating a lot more heat from the SMD Chips than the normal hollow wall design, and Less Heat = More Life.  Second, they have a IC Driver installed to provide the correct amperes to the diodes, not mater what voltage is being supplied by the electrical system.  This reduces stress on the diodes and allows for rapid shifting in voltage to increase and decrease brightness like with running lights on while using a turn signal, without the LEDs flickering.  Other brands just use simple circuit wiring with resistors which can lead to flickering when the lights are on.  Third, there are 2 places on these that have aluminum, instead of simple fiberglass PCB substrate, one is between the two chip panels as I mentioned before, and the other is the housing for the IC Driver.  This help with not only dissipating heat away from the LEDs and driver, but also increase the structural integrity.  Lastly, these are assembled with 3528 SMD LEDs instead of the cheaper and lower lumen output 1210 or 5050 SMD LEDs.  This makes it possible to increase the light output while reducing the actual amount of SMD LEDs required, there by reducing the heat output which in turn increases their life span.Putting the bulbs is is pretty simple. just remember that if you install the bulb and it doesn't come on, pull it out and flip it around.  These are polarity sensitive as are all LEDs so unlike incandescent bulbs that will work both directions, these will only work in once direction.  I have been using them for a couple of weeks now and haven't noticed any issues that need to be addressed so far, but If I do I will update my review.  I am also going to update my review once I get the wiring configured correctly on my truck.  Overall I am extremely impressed with these bulbs and I would recommend them.  I am going to get some more to install in my wife's Honda Pilot.I was provided a sample product, at a discounted price by the seller, in exchange for my honest and unbiased evaluation and review.

I haven't got to use this much but I have run it thru the 5-hour break in and done the first oil change.  I've only run it for a few short times since in the couple months I have had it.The main reason I liked this model is it can run on propane which has a much better shelf-life than gasoline but it also gives me the option of running on gasoline if I need to.  Should my supply of propane run out I can always use the gas I keep for my lawnmower or siphon out of the tractor to keep the power going.A few things I have learned that seem important...-The choke does not seem to be "linear" with the label.  For propane it says 75% choke to electric start, I found this to be about where the metal clip is holding the air filter on slightly closer to "run" than to "full choke" (see pics with arrows).  I fixed this by adding my own labels to the air intake box next to the factory choke labels.-When you have the choke in the correct position it starts up VERY easily with electric start in about 3 seconds of cranking from "dry" and is doable on pull-start tho it likes to backfire if over-choked on pull start.  When the choke is not in the correct position, it is nearly impossible to start nomater what, at least on propane.-Using a 20lb propane tank it may "freeze up" in cooler temps, I had this happen during my break-in run when the weather was about 40-50F.  I mitigated it by moving the propane tank to the side of the generator opposite the pull-cord, it seems the engine/generator heat is blown that way and it was just enough warmth to keep the propane tank around 65-70F so it would vaporize fast enough to keep up with demand.  I think using a 40lb tank would work considerably better in colder weather since it would have a larger area to help warm up the fuel.  Worst case you could get one of the special electric propane tank warmers and plug it into the generator.-The hose will reach fine to connect a 40lb tankI also got a couple other accessories that seem to work well with this - I wanted a more subtle tent/cover than what Champion sells and I also got the cord to bring the power inside more easily.Tent:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/GenTent-Running-Cover-Universal-Kit-Standard-Edition-3000w-10000w-Portable-Generators/dp/B0088EVIR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">GenTent Running Cover -Universal Kit - Standard Edition 3000w-10000w Portable Generators</a>Cord:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Champion-25-Foot-30-Amp-125-250-Volt-Fan-Style-Generator-Extension-Cord-L14-30P-to-four-5-20R/dp/B005Z17WLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Champion 25-Foot 30-Amp 125/250-Volt Fan-Style Generator Extension Cord (L14-30P to four 5-20R)</a>If you plan to run propane, don't get your fuel from the "easy swap" stations at grocery stores and gas stations, I found the tanks they gave me were only filled with 12-14lb of fuel in a 20lb tank.  When I went to buy bigger 40lb tanks at a local farm equipment store I paid the same amount to fill up 80lb of fuel into two 40lb tanks as I paid to get the two 20lb partly-full "ready to go" tanks swapped for empties from a nearby BBQ tank exchange.  Also, some places that refill propane can fill a partially full tank and only charge for what you take vs "by the tank size", this is especially good if you have an outage and use up part of a tank but not the whole thing.  Well worth calling around to see who will fill a partly full tank and only bill for what it holds so you can always start with a full supply and not have to "lose" the fuel you already have.To measure how much propane gas is in your tank get a cheap bathroom scale (analog scale is easier in my opinion) and weigh the tank.  Then find where the stamped marking is on the metal rim at the top of the tank for empty weight (my 20lb tanks weigh 18lbs empty) and subtract.  This is how much fuel is in the tank - and should be close to the rated capacity.  My "full" exchanged BBQ tank weighted 32lbs, tank was stamped TW18, subtracting that is 14lbs of fuel in the 20lb tank.  When I had it filled by the farm equipment store after the break-in run the same tank weighted 38lbs, subtracting TW18 gives me darn near 20lbs of fuel.  Much more fuel for much less money!I would suggest putting a 20lb propane tank at the "other end" vs what I show in my pictures - see my note about freezing tanks.  The hose will reach fine to 20lb tank on the far side from the inlet.  I don't think a 40lb tank would have the same problems.

The product looked exactly the same as the one that got pulled out of the engine. This was to fix the P0126 error thrown out by the computer inside of the car. At first, the Genuine Mazda (L35G-18-840) Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor was replaced by a new one in Nov. 2015, the error disappeared for a couple months, could have been when I disconnect the battery.But the error came up again, months later after driving a long distance trip. While the check engine was on, the car felt restricted, loosing power especially when at 50 mph or less. Until you clear the error, the car will continue to trip up. Anyways, the pictures show the part that got removed from the car, it looks good still BUT it could be stuck open/closed, internally. I took one of the clamps out too, replaced with one that can be dialed with a flat-head screwdriver. Its day 2 of the new part installed, the car feels normal for now.The pictures of the part connected to the engine, that is the new one. The one laying on the cloth is the old one.There are videos on how to change the parts on the web.This was for a '08 mazda 3. We disconnected the larger hose, on the right of the radiator to dump out the coolant fluid. Its a more direct dumping pipe vs using the left side screw to dump the coolant. From underneath looking up at coolant tank. This was all done from underneath while the car was lifted off the ground.When the part is replaced, either re-use the coolant or use one that you bought. Turn on your car, let the coolant get sucked in, the tank will show some bubbling while the car is on. You can turn on the heater on full blast to accelerate the procedure. When you have used a considerable amount of coolant, make sure you're watching the Hot/Cold gauge, its got to stay at mid point. We don't want the car to overheat. There is a marker on the coolant tank that shows where you should fill up to. Make sure it's at that point after the car has been running and the car has basically removed all the air pockets.10 minutes should be a good time to test it by. You may drive off for a test, WATCH that gauge though. If it starts to overheat, you need more coolant in the tank then turn on the car for some more idle.That's my little experience I can offer, maybe it will assist you.Good luck with your mechanics.

New one just arrived, Box destroyed and on top of that, pin tabs are off left to right by 1/4" and 2 pin tabs are off front to back by 1/4". So only the right side fits.If tabs fit it would be a great item. Heavy duty built, painted very nice and price is good. But now you know why the price is so much lower then anyone else.

One of the four rings was slightly disfigured.  It looked like it may not have come out of the mold right. I added a pic and you can see the defect at about one o'clock. That said it still fit the wheel and seems to be working.Would have given a better rating if all four rings were the same quality.

Bought this bar for the main center light on ny beater/ beach truck was Kind of let down by this light. I have used high dollar led bars and I've used some cheap bars. I've had good luck with some other cheaper 6in and 12in bars. The two cheap 6in and 12in bars are brighter than this bar. Construction and mounting seem pretty good quality. But the light from it is not impressive for a 22in curved bar.

Great little multi purpose accent/license plate light.  I used these as license plate lights after customizing my rear brake lights with flush mount units that did not have integrated plate lights.  A couple tech notes:The threaded part and nut is stainless, light housing is aluminum.Thread size is 6.0mmx1.0Length is about 1/2"-3/4"wiring is THIN!!  You will have to use connectors that are 20-22ga to fit.You can either thread the mounting point (as I did) and use the included nut as a locking nut, or drill through and use the nut to secure it.Overall, they work well.  -1 star for the thinness of the wires but otherwise I am very impressed.

Needed a new battery for my 2007 Yamaha WR450F.  This is a very light battery.  The WPS battery weighed 1lb 1.4 oz vs 4 lbs 13.8oz for the old lead acid battery.  That's a weight savings of 3 lbs 12.4 oz.It arrived fully charged, according to the test light.  The packaging included some brief instructions, new nuts and screws for the terminals, and 4 foam spacers.Fitment wise, the battery is smaller than the original, but it included 4 foam spacers that you can stick on the battery to help fit your battery.  I used 4 of them to help space the battery to ensure it won't be moving around on my bike.  I had to use a razor blade to cut them to the appropriate size for my application.The battery has markings indicating it's 29Wh and 12volts (which converts to 2.41Ah).  I believe it is listed at 150 CCA, which is less than the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Shorai-LFX14A2-BS12-Extreme-Rate-Lithium-Iron-Powersports-Battery/dp/B005EYM4JC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Shorai LFX14A2-BS12 Extreme Rate Lithium Iron Powersports Battery</a>'s 210 CCA, but more than the stock&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Yuasa-YUAM727ZS-YTZ7S-Battery/dp/B000UK1054/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Yuasa YUAM727ZS YTZ7S Battery</a>'s 130CCABike started right up after install. During the first ride, it started the bike most (80%) of the time.  The other 20% of the time, the bike started first kick.  I've never owned the bike with a working battery before, so I don't know if this is normal or not.UPDATE 10/3/16.  Upgrading my review to 5 stars.  After learning what my bike likes a little bit more (sometimes it likes hot start or a twist of the throttle while holding the starter), I'm able to start it 99% of the time with e-start only.  Last trip, I did 100+ miles in the desert, didn't have to use the kick starter once.Update 10/10/17. Over the past few months, the battery barely holds a charge. I had it warranted, but the warranty process was very slow (took over a month!) I'll update the review with details about the new battery.

The Tri-Lynx 00028 is a solar-powered, motion-activated security light.  It absorbs solar energy during the day and releases it at night upon sensing movement.  This device can be nailed or Velcro-strapped above a door or window.  However, I tied it to a fence post using twine that I inserted into the nail holes and tied around the post.  I followed the instructions and allowed the device to absorb sunlight for nearly twenty-four hours before installing it.  The Tri-Lynx 00028 is a bright light that will turn on when I step within approximately five or six feet of it.  The light is powerful enough to clearly illuminate the back patio, the patio door, and the garage door in my backyard.  The light is powerful enough to be seen from my bedroom window; it will remain on for approximately one minute after activation.  I recommend the Tri-Lynx 00028 as an easy-to-install, economical security light for placing above a door that obtains sunlight.

In our new-to-us house, we had a plumber install water lines and a sink in the garage. Shortly thereafter I added shelves above the sink, and the first product to go on the shelves was hand cleaner. My son and I like to work on our cars and also on his remote control racing trucks, and this stuff flat out works to get the oil, dirt and grease off before we track it inside.This hand cleaner helps us avoid the wrath of She Who Must be Obeyed, so we like this stuff a lot.The things that my son and I can get into in the garage are vast and varied; we've taken apart our kitchen cabinets and repainted them. We've kept a 1930 Ford Model A well greased and in good operating condition. We've totally stripped a 1998 Jeep Wrangler TJ and sold off the parts, and we've done everything else that you would expect needs to be done around the house.In every case, this hand cleaner has played a key part of my wife's willingness to allow us to come back into the house!! Paint, oil, grease, engine compartment grime, and every other conceivable type of substance that we could streak across our clothing and get on our hands, arms and legs... did. However, Permatex Blue got it off and it breaks down the grime well enough that moves down the sink in without a clog. Good deal.Great stuff. If you are a roll-up-your-sleeves-and-jump-in type of person, then we totally recommend Permatex Cream hand Cleaner for your after-project (or 'its time for dinner') needs!Go for it!

Works as expected, easy install. I actually got 556uw, but it seems to be the same. Just wire three wire to my Excalibur (AL1660EDPB) Deluxe 1-Way Vehicle Security and Remote Start System 3pin Relay port see picture for detail. Then use a hot glue gun put 4 points on the key ring of my 2008 Honda Pilot then put the sensor ring around it.

Good product and price. Tried looking for this outfit for my truck everywhere but decided to search amazon and found what i was looking for. The only thing i did not like was the wire the suppose to hold the red nose to the grille. Was not cutting it for me and ended up using zip ties for a much sturdier look.

Easy bolt on trailer hitch.  I was worried how it would look with hanging under the bumper and really wanted to get one that sat a little higher but this was a perfect fit.  It is very snug up to the bumper and it was a lot easier than cutting into the bumper.

If you're looking at this product and have a Toyota truck, by now you know how far away the trailer harness sockets are. This is the perfect length to route from the socket to the hitch. I zip tied wire loom to each end and used a third longer zip tie to attach it to the left safety chain loop. Plug tucks under the bumper cover. Looks factory...stoked!

For the past few years, in SFO bay area, we seem to get more earthquakes than rain. For a welcome change, we had quite a few wet days this month. So, I ended up buying a pair of ANCO wiper blades, after so many years!Installation was a straightforward process, except that one of the old wiper blade latch was stuck and it was a but of struggle to remove.The wipers do a pretty good job in light as well as heavy rains. I am not sure about how long they will last, but I am very happy with them at the moment.Note that, these look different from Honda OEM wiper blades. Due to low profile design, the metal wiper arms seem to stand out (check out the picture)

I use this to cover the spare tire on my Ranger Z118 trailer. Looks great and works great. The cover fits like OJ's glove, nice and tight! I have put the trailer in the water at least once a month since March and the cover is holding up just fine. Hasn't faded. This is my second purchase of a tire cover from Amazon, the first being white. Don't recommend that anyone purchase any color but black. When the tires get wet, they tend to discolor the cover. GO BUCKS! UPDATE:  Oct 20, 2016 - Still have the tire cover and it looks almost brand new. I do, however, put 303 Aerospace Protectant on it and I cover my boat with a heavy tarp, the same one sees truckers use to cover their cargo. Although I put the boat trailer in the water at least once a month, the water has not damaged the tire cover. 11-5-16 - Catastrophe! Since I live in the country, i.e. non-city, it appears that a wild animal likes my tire cover too. I was getting my tackle ready for an upcoming tournament and noticed the cover was ripped and chewed on at the bottom of the cover. Ill have to get another cover. In the meantime, Ill use a little Gorilla tape (a best seller here on Amazon) to make the cover presentable until I get the new cover. Too bad, great product!

...after chatting with a Royal Purple engineer, I decided to try this in my 2006 BMW R1200GS transmission. I'm pleased to report that my transmission has never shifted so well with hugely reduced clunking save that of 1st to 2nd which is also less obvious... I had been running the factory BMW trans oil supplied by my local dealer (75w90). I also find that when I want neutral, coming to a stop, it is much improved over the factory lube... Long-term test coming up probably next spring, 2018...

Arrived on time and in nice box. I got all peices as listed minus a couple of small clamps that were not listed but could have been included to attach the inlet tube to the engine valve. But I did not feel like having the filter in the wheel well exposed to elements so I cut and rigged the second pipe to fit into the engine bay perfectly. If you want the filter in the wheel well you will have to jack up the car and remove the splashguard/Old U hose. Installed on my 97 Accord SE. Also the previous tubing from my engine was connected with black metal clamps that I did not feel like messing with so I cut the blue tubing as well. All in all it was an easy and fun project for $45 bucks! The last photo is of the cold air intake after 5 months. Shows no rust yet and still sounds like a beast.

These lights were a quick and easy installation... So much so that I replaced all five Amber and then ordered seven red for the rear and two back corners. I also ordered LED lights to replace the T10 condescend lights that came with the assembly. Be sure to order a roll of butyl tape to guarantee a tight, waterproof installation to last the next decade or two.

The a-pillar and switches were a perfect fit. I recommend using the dbox found on YouTube by newerjk. I'm not an electrician by any far stretch of the imagination, but if you use the dbox, you can wire up all the installed switches and have wires for on more. As far as the switches are concerned, be careful when cutting out the holes in the a pillar. If you make them too big the switches will move around and look less than professional.

Love the results on my 2011 Challenger! This was my first time ever doing anything to a car beyond washing it.My process was to claybar the car panel by panel (hood/front, doors, etc) then apply this wax and keep going around the car until it's all covered.I was surprised how thin it was, l was worried l wasn't putting nearly enough on, but youtube videos proved I was doing it right. Going around the whole car gave the wax plenty of time to cure. I started buffing off the wax where l first applied it, using the included towel.The final result left it incredibly smooth, my hand literally slipped across the freshly buffed areas. It left it pretty shiny, but l know it could get shinier if I buffed out the swirls with polish or a compound. I don't have a machine buffer and the car is white, so it's no big deal really. Either way, fantastic wax with great protection!

I bought this pump to use as a portable diesel pump for my tractor business.  I've converted a 15-gallon ag sprayer (same materials as an actual diesel jug at the store) to a diesel tank and use this as a transfer tank.Initial assembly was very simple.  However, USE teflon tape on the threaded fittings per the instructions.  I missed that part and had a leak during my first use.  My fault!The battery clips are long enough to reach my tractor battery even while the tank is in the back of my truck.  The hoses are also plenty long as well.The pump is VERY strong and is heavy made.  The hoses seem to be very durable as well.  The dispenser handle is plastic and I'll definitely have to keep an eye out that it doesn't get slammed in the tailgate or something.I have also powered this pump with a portable 12V Schumacher battery/jump starter as an even more mobile solution.So far...highly recommended!

- Update after approx 20 months -This frame was mounted in front and is naturally susceptible to rock chips etc. It has developed two rusty spots where paint has been chipped away. It really should be made of something more durable material.Simple clean design. Don't overtighten screws. Bend the tabs to keep plate flush against face of frame.

Wanted to jazz up my bike and saw these lights for reasonable price. Received today and will install tomorrow. Tested to ensure all strips are working properly. Remote isn't all that bad just learning cycle of colors which may be illegal in GA (Blue) definitely possible red as well according to Motorcycle law book. Anyway, looking forward to installing and I'll give a follow up update with pic's possibly.UPDATE: so when I mapped out lights I realized I needed two box kits in order to get light all the way around. The biggest issue I ran into was connecting to my bikes battery, it wouldn't stay on so I attached the plugs to a 9 volt battery and taped it down under my seat. Because the unplug that's connected sticks out slightly I turn off lights via remote and simply unplug to avoid running battery down.Otherwise setup was quite easy. But if you have a med to large bike but two boxes. Just my recommendation.Oh and they look awesome.

I put two strips in the footwells and put the other two in the trunk because 3 of the leds from one of the strips didn't light up. The 3M tape in the back of the strip was ok and the wire was about a 24 gauge or maybe smaller so its a little hard to work with. I put up a pic of the two in the footwells. overall these are way better than another set i bought from another seller, these don't start to flicker after a few minutes of being on like the others. Ive had these on for more than an hour at times when driving and no flickering!

I used this on a valve cover on a 2.4 Ecotec in my Slingshot. And of course I wanted it to turn out perfectly. And it did. I baked it in the convection oven at 200 degrees for about 1 1/2 hours, and it looks great. I had a couple of runs in it after spraying it but when on the engine you have to look really hard to see them.

Bought a pair from Walmart because I needed some to protect from my work clothes. I've had them 3 months and the side bolster section of my driver seat is already worn completely away. Like others, I expected the thick material for the seat portion to make up the entire cover, but the other material which tore already is VERY thin material.I had a set of $40 covers for two front and a bench seat in the rear and they lasted longer than these, they just weren't water proof.I would advise to stay away.

Warn Zeon 12-cable wireAwesome winch comes with everything needed to mount to your carrier. Has roller fairlead and remote as well. Also comes with a tag line with warn logos to pull winch or help spool it back up without putting your fingers near the spool. Warn is legendary for its performance and reliability. So don't buy cheap when you buy a winch this is my 8th warn including atv winches I had 5. I've never has one issue with them.

I was fairly impressed by the pictures, so instead of going to a spray service, I bought this kit. Note that with this kit you also need a paint mixer attachment for a drill, acetone, and 2 GOOD paint brushes (included brush is terrible and the compound builds up between the bristles.)The prep is by far the most work. If you don't have a sander, you will have a long day ahead of you. I used the included hand pad and 100 grit sandpaper on a 4 orbital sander. This took 1-2 hours. Taping took 30min and paint took 1 hr. (x2)The compound itself is akin what you would get at the dealership. And needs to be mixed throughly with a drill.I had 2 issues -The 1st roller was good but the second fell apart 10min before I was finished with the second coat. Which caused me to brush the remaining 1x5 of the bed.The 2nd is that I ran out before I was able to do touch ups. Knowing this now, I would recommend to add 10% of the specified thinner (read the directions.) A gallon was barely enough to finish my 6 bed, so I would love to see the kit include another quart for touch ups and 8 beds.

I used these equalizers to replace the stock metal equalizer on a brand new travel trailer.  I elected to also install a MorRyde wet bolt and shackle kit to replace the thin OEM Lippert shackles that came with the trailer.Installation was fairly straight forward.  I was able to change out the equalizer and suspension components on one side of the trailer while the other side was still on the ground.  Make sure you use good safety stands on the side that is jacked up.If you are changing out the bushings and other suspension components, do the end of the springs first before trying to tackle the equalizer.  This will make the job much easier.  Another tip is to make sure you have wooden blocks or jacks ready to support each axle while you have the components disassembled.  All in all, it took me about 3 hours per side to replace the bushings, bolts, shackles, and equalizer.  That also included greasing the wet bolts.Once the job was complete, we towed the rig for a couple hundred miles.  The ride was nice, and there was zero noise that you typically find with OEM suspension components.  Please note that there are rubber components in these equalizers, so I understand that they will likely wear out and have to be replaced at some time in the future.  What is nice is that MorRyde provides specific information in the instructions on how to check the parts for wear.I'm including a photo of the parts installed after the job was completed.  I'd purchase these parts again.

The remote for our latest vehicle (2012 Toyota Sienna) has a hair-trigger, and having my key chain in my pocket led to regular unintentional button presses, sometimes multiple times a day, caused by nothing more than standing up from a chair or bending over to feed the dogs.  I would go out in the morning and find the van unlocked or side doors slid open, all because the remote buttons activated so easily.  For decades I have carried my car remote on my key chain in my pocket and never had this problem, and it was driving me crazy.I looked for an after-market silicone cover, but I couldn't find one for our particular configuration of buttons.  But it got me thinking that if I could coat the remote in something rubbery it would cut down on the incidental, unintentional button presses.  I have used black Plasti-Dip in the past for other things, and was happy to find they also have a clear version.Long story short, I put four coats of this on my remote and now the buttons don't press while in my pocket!  I have also uploaded a picture if you want to see the final product.  After four coats it's not quite clear and has a little bit of haze, but the button icons are still easily readable.There's no telling how it will hold up long term, and I plan to come back here and update this review as events warrant, but right now it has worked exactly as expected, and I couldn't be happier with it..UPDATE 2014-03-04: Well, after nine months the remote is still working as expected and the plasti-dip coating is still greatly reducing inadvertent button presses, so no complaints.

The overall quality of this jump starter/battery pack is very good. It feels like a heavy duty product and has a rugged design and it is fairly small in size.  It has a built in 16800 mAh battery and a peak current of 800 amps. I often run out of battery on my 18 foot boat because I leave accessories such as speaker system, chargers and fan running while I am anchored and fishing. I hate turning the engine on to keep my battery running while fishing. This portable jump starter is the perfect solution. It jump started my Mercury 3.0L gasoline boat engine on the first try over 7 times in the last 2 weeks and it still has around 65% battery left. At this pace I should be able to jump start it a total of 20 times or more before needing to recharge. It has various other features such as 2 USB ports to charge other devices, built in bright flashlight, battery indicator, two DC outputs to charge various devices such as Laptops, safety protections and all works perfectly.The jump starter comes with everything you need to take advantage of all the features. All of which comes in a nice black case which has pockets to keep everything organized. It comes with a pair of high quality clamps, car charger, and wall charger, 4 in 1 USB charger for Android/Apple and other devices and a DC output adapter to plug in laptops or other cigarette lighter port accessories. There is only one button to operate the device. Press it to turn on the device and check the battery level. I charged my Dell XPS laptop, cell phone and Bluetooth speaker without an issue. I didn't do full performance tests to see how long or how many times my phone and laptop can be charged. The results will vary on the power that is drained by your laptop or cell phone. I charged my laptop for 20 minutes and it used 10% battery, it should charge my laptop for around 3.5 hours when the battery pack is full.  In theory you should be able to charge most cell phones 7 times since most cell phones have a battery size of 2000 mAh. I don't intend to use it for that purpose because my boat has inverters to allow me to charge all of my devices. The LED light is very bright and it has three modes, strobing slow and fast and continuous on. Simply press and hold the ON button to turn on the light and press it gain to change the modes.Jump starting the engine is super easy. You simply plug in the clamp adapter into the battery pack and plug in the two clamps into the battery back/jump starter. You will notice a green light on the clamp. Then start your engine. There is no need to turn the battery pack/jump starter ON. I was able to jump start my boat every time without an issue. Make sure to remove the clamps as soon as the engine starts.Overall I am very impressed with this portable jumper starter/power back. It is superior to most other jump starters in almost every way. If you are looking to buy one, this should be one of your top choices. I did receive this product for free in exchange for a honest and unbiased review. I hope my review was able to help you make a wise purchasing decision.

Goes on very easy, no real pressure needed to apply either part. Just time consuming because I'm polishing a truck bed cover. Took about 2-3 hours to do one part, but the results speak for themselves. This cover is about 8 years old and was never polished. No complaint here, just need more time to finish the rest of the panels. To see what i started with, look at the panel close to the truck cab.Application was not difficult, just used some rags for the deoxidizer, and applied in same manner as found on youtube videos. Polish applied in same manner as well using carpet scrap, and then buffed to a shine with clean rags.

I recently restored a pair of headlights on a Honda Accord. I went through the sanding process, then I paired the M100 with the Purple foam wool 3.5 in. pad. AMAZING combination for headlight restoration on very hazy headlights. This compound worked so good, I skipped the M205 and just went straight to Meguiars ultimate wax(sealant). Looks BRAND NEW. When the weather gets better I will be using it for paint correction and pairing it with the 6.5 in. purple foam wool pads that I also purchased from you. Can't wait to see how good this combination will work.

The part delivered was the wrong model. The base of the unit does not fit into the battery cover. I had to retrofit the unit to fit into the battery cover. I snipped off the base tangs and used a zip tie to have it fit snug. Also, the red cable is cheaply made &  two inches shorter than the original cable. I used the old red cable which fit fine. Ensure that the seller shows the correct photo. I only have photos of the original part. I will give another reply after a couple of week testing the unit.

Loved that so many different pads come with this package. The pads aren't the strong durability for cutting compounds, but work great for polishing and waxing my motorcycle.

Used this to protect wiring on a 30 year old Ford Ranger project  Was having issues with wires contacting hot areas and failing.  Used it to protect a Painless fuel pump relay wiring.  Also, wires to to O2 sensor commonly burned on the exhaust.

Awesome fit. Didn't realize that I had the turn signal and defrost options. I Plugged them in and it all worked. I modded the mirrors, thanks to youtube,  so the front amber light is a running light and not a turn signal.  Very happy and highly recommended.I still have some wiring to finish, I'll update my picture once it is complete.2010 GMC Sierra 2500HD

I had this unit for 1 year, used it maybe 10 times and the locking head sheared off when I barely bumped the coupler on my 5x10 trailer with my hitch..  This hitch pin can slide side to side like all hitch pins, but the problem with this unit is that IF the unit slides all the way towards the end with the lock, pressure can be exerted on the weakest part of the hitch pin which is where the shaft tapers in for the locking mechanism.  its roughly 1/3 the diameter of the hitch pin.  This is a very STUPID design, that could have easily been fixed with proper testing.  If the locking barrel was 1/4" longer on the inboard side, this would have never happened because all of the force would be exerted on the full diameter portion of the hitch pin.

The ghost lights we're exactly as described above. They are definitely a attention grabber so if you have a chrysler / mopar then these are a great buy. Install was a breeze also

Love these mirrors and how they look. Helps me see all the terrible drivers around me. People say they scratch their mirrors which I see how it happens. Simple solution is to put some black duct tape inside the mirror where it will make contact with your truck mirror...your welcome. These mirrors have been great on camping trips all year and I recommend.

Item was defective as noted by another customer.  The foam filter was glued on an angle, which left a large section of the pleated filter exposed. Not sure how this passed quality control and was placed in a box unnoticed. Also, incase it matters to you, this is not an original as mention in other reviews. The original equipment in my vehicle actually has Volvo printed on the filter and is made in Austria. This carries the Mahle name and is made in France.

I recently did a center stand on the street glide. I had to get the bike one inch lower for the stand to work properly with all of the air out of my air ride. I rolled the dice on these and love them. They went on smoothly in less than 15 minutes. Use the bolts they send you and you will have no issues. They are heavy and the welds looked good. Had them on there for over a month now with no issues. I only used the one inch hole because that is all I needed. I don't think I would ever use the 3 inch drop...that looks like you would be putting your shocks at a very extreme angle but it is there if you want to try it.  Not much else to say about them...they were a decent price, shipped fast and worked exactly as described. Heavy duty lowering blocks for this price will be hard to beat. Any questions please let me know. Keep your knees in the breeze!

This device is super handy. It makes changing the oil on my small engines much less of a hassle, much cleaner, and it seems like I get more dirty oil out of my engine. The build quality of this awesome and it seems like it will last a lifetime. It reminds me of those old school gas cans that are handed down through the generations. I'll be telling a few of my friends about this. It's a game changer!

This review is for MAOZUA D900 CAN OBD2 Scan Tool Live Data Diagnostic Engine Code Reader***I received this product free to do a review. I try to be as objective as possible and only provide you with info that I know will be useful to someone. My goal is to provide info about the product that is not included in the product description. Any obvious issues will be noted and stars will be detracted.The Maozua scan tool live data diagnostic engine code reader was useful, simple to use and very helpful!!!!!  :) To get started the scan tool runs off of 3 AA batteries.  The program on the device walks you through all the steps ensuring you can find your results.  It has a standard port attachment to access many vehicles and has the ability to read the information for a large variety of vehicle makes (30). I used this product on my Chevy 2500 gas engine since there was a maintenance light on.After putting in batteries,attaching the cord to the scan tool and then to the vehicle of choice I was given a list of vehicle  makes to choose from.  The vehicle makes were listed alphabetically making it convenient to locate my make of vehicle.I punched the scan button and realized my first mistakes was to not have the ignition switch to on. :( OOPS!  After I corrected that minor detail thanks to the  prompt of the Maozua scan tool (yeah them! :)) it was a mater of waiting about one minute before a my information was ready.  There are seven scanning options that are listed to make the process easy.  (1) Read DTCs (2) Erase DTCs (3) Live Data (4) Freeze Frame (5) MIL Status (6) I/M readiness (7) vehicle info.  Forward and backward are your maneuvering options for navigating the system.Truck temperature, fuel system information, engine speed, vehicle speed, and oxygen sensors are included in the list of 27 items that can be viewed under the live data option.For my vehicle the MIL status said off which meant the vehicle was not having any issues.  There were no DTC's which meant I could take the vehicle for inspection.  YIPPIE!!After I was finished with the Mazoua scan tool I realized it has the option to adjust the brightness which when adjusted made a HUGE difference when trying to read it in bright daylight.  The last data collected from each option is kept until the next use or until you choose to delete the data which can be very beneficial to show the husband when he comes home from work.  ;)The Mazoua scan tool live data diagnostic engine code reader is well worth the price.

I have seen good reviews on this tool but for me ots junk. I am a professional alignment mechanic and i ordered one of these and the jaws broke the very first time i used it, sent back and got a replacement no problem. Used it probably 8-10 times and the jaws broke again after maybe 2 months. I use tools to make my living and this thing is junk

It's really unique and fun! Much better than the old accordion cardboard- Simple to get in place. I like that it has structure to not just fall down and extra fabric in width too-Update: to fold into the storage bag if you twist and turn one way and it doesn't fold right up then twist and turn in the opposite direction and it'll fold right up.

I wasn't impressed with this cover from the beginning.  Upon opening the box it really stunk of cheap plastic.  I immediately tossed it outside before it had the chance to smell up the rest of the house.  I finally decided to give this a shot today in anticipation for the storm we are supposed to receive this weekend.  I tried to install the cover on a 2010 F-150.  The cover is slightly too small for the truck but it was close so I purchased it anyway. The material seems thin and weak, we shall see after a few weeks of use. The magnets have no padding other than the thin material and I am concerned this cover is going to scratch my paint. When trying to shut the flap in the doors it blows out because the material is so thin and has no weight to it.  This could be solved by adding something for weight or by opening your back door when installing this.  If you only have 2 doors, you don't have that option. This is not a knock on the product but more of a PSA.  A lot of vehicles now have Aluminum or composite body panels which makes the magnets useless.  The hood on my truck is aluminum so I had to tuck the bottom of the cover under my wipers.I don't have a lot of hope for this product, I didn't give it one star because it is what it says but in my opinion it needs improvement.  If it performs well over the next few weeks I will upgrade my rating but as of right now I am disappointed with the difficulty of using the cover.  In the time it took to get it appropriately installed, I could have cleared the snow and ice from my windshield.  I received this cover at a discount in exchange for testing and reviewing the product. I stand by my review and do not give discounted products great reviews if they do not deserve them. I count on honest reviews when making purchases as much as you do!

MUST READ: The prongs on this bulb is incorrect for H11 and it would not fit in my 2005 Acura MDX (actually damaged the OEM mount). It was poorly manufactured and a noticeable downgrade from the current generic HID bulb I had in use. Slow and ineffective customer service. Truly NOT a premium brand of HID lights.Note in the pictures how the metal prongs are the incorrect size (back 2 prongs are too wide and designed the wrong way thus not fitting. Front prong is obviously too small vs original). Also, both bulbs came dirty as shown in pic.

I bought this cargo net for my Kia Soul 2012.PRO- Material is good.  Seems longlasting.- Upper attachment is with the rubber & down atachment is with clips, but as in my case I had to install&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Genuine-Scion-Accessories-PT347-52080-HW-Cargo-Net-Hardware-Kit/dp/B00DF7B64E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Genuine Scion Accessories PT347-52080-HW Cargo Net Hardware Kit</a>&nbsp;that did the job.- It has 3 compartments: The pocket with cover in the left side (iPads...), a large central mesh compartment (umbrellas, etc), and a front easy available mesh compartment (docs...)CONIt is small.  Don't expect a large cargo net.  It is just ok to organize some items in the cargo place.We are happy with it.If review is helpful please v..., thanks.

Installed on my 16' SRW 6.7L F350 4x4. It fit great. Install time for both sides was an hour. Inital drive afterwards was a bit rough but after a week everything settled and i don't notice the difference in ride or i got use to it.Install tips i used--after you take the wheel off, with the axle still supported i put my spring compressors on so the weight of the truck kept the springs compressed THEN i put a jack stand under the frame and dropped the front axle so most of the work was already done.- i used a telescoping screw jack between the axle and the frame to push the axle down enough to slide the spacer in.Install time on both sides was literally an hour.

Was definitely not satisfied with this wheel! First of all it did not come with the book shown in the picture. Very minimal instructions also! I watched 3-4 You Tube videos with these types of wheels to get a idea of exactly how to use. I am handy with tools and projects and I used the wheel in my 2005 Dodge Ram PU to remove a Vinyl decal  a little over a year old. I have successfully removed these decals with a heat gun and with a citrus based Decal remover to get off any remaining residue. Wish I would have stayed with this method as now I have to spend $$$ to have the section  I used this wheel (Pickup tailgate) on to get repainted!!! I used a Dewalt 3 speed Cordless drill with a tip speed of 2200 RPM and this was the result. Shameful!

Works great!! Sprayed on nice and smooth. At first I was a little worried because it left a milky residue at first. But when dry it looks fantastic! I used it on my son's power wheels. Does leave some orange peel behind that will need buffed out. Buy more then you think you may actually need. I ended up using two whole cans for one powerwheels with two coats. But overall very pleased!!

I detail a few hundred cars a year and absolutely love this stuff. I always have some in my personal kit I leave in my truck. Everyone I show this to loves it. I do use it every time, since it works very well as a drying aid too. Just put a spray or two on a side of a waffle weave towel and the panel is almost completely dry

Loved the keyless entry function, but I have had two that the inner handle broke essentially locking us inside. Fortunately I had a Swiss army knife and was able to remove the inner portion to escape. The second time I was sure to keep a screwdriver inside and was able to escape once again. Seems to be a poor design on the inner handle. I had the original latch on this motorhome for 10 years with no problems, now two broken handles in two years!

Absolutely perfect OEM replacement part. Swapping out both the driver's and passenger's side handles took less than 5 minutes.

I highly recommend this to anyone with a 6.0L powerstroke. It fits like factory and adds some capacity. It also upgraded the filter. It installs in less than an hour. Very quick, very good. I wasn't having trans temp issues, but when I was already spending $100 on fluid and a filter, I decided this would be a worthwhile investment.

Hard-wired this with a 20-amp on/off switch and installed it in a Tacoma on back of the center console.  Love the four USB ports and really like the feature that the USB ports have power full time, whether or not the inverter itself is turned on.  The provided wiring looks like ten gauge, which; may be thick enough for an 1100 watt inverter.

Terrible experience. One of the rcas doesnt work not matter what I do to it. Took me hours of tested to figure out it was this harness that wasn't working. I was using this on an old radio and old vehicle so the last thing I thought would be the problem was this brand new harness. Tried to see if it was the radio, the car l, the amo, and finally after hrs of tinkering I narrows it down to an issue with one of the rcas. Had to make my own to make this work which almost defeats the purpose of using a harness I shouldve just made the whole harness myself.

I'm giving this 2 stars because of the crappy condition of the packaging when delivered. Also for the huge inconvenience of having to run to hardware store to buy the missing hardware that should have been included!That said, the bars and pieces came color coded. Green for driver side and clear for passenger side. As you can see prior to installing, I staged everything for ease. That's when I noticed I was missing a few bolts, nuts, and washers.I hoped on the motorcycle and off to the hardware store I went. I had to pick up the missing items. Not end of the world, but inconvenient! I value my time, that whole process of having to run and get the missing components just frustrated me and delayed the install a couple of hours! Time I could have spent giving the product a great 5 star review!!!!Once I spent the $5 for the parts and had them back home. I cracked open a cold drink and had them on the truck in about an hour.The bars look good and are sturdy. Just very disappointed at the inconvenience of missing parts and busted up package!

Excellent wheel chock! Mounted to my garage floor with a 2015 Softail slim sitting in it, very sturdy, easy to put bike in and very easy to pull bike out. I have 2 new hip replacements, easier for me to mount bike in upright position, my only conflict was, can I get the bike out as weak as I am right now, NO problem!! I recommend this wheel chock highly, especially for the price!

This wiring harness is very well made and worked wonderfully on my 2012 F150 for installing aftermarket fog lights. I was a bit worried about the supplied plugs based on previous reviews, so I added a few drops of solder to each crimp connector and filled the back of the plugs with silicone sealant to keep them dry. I have not had any issues with flickering so far (~2 months later). The lead to the switch was a bit tight in my truck, but it worked (one could probably wire it a bit more directly, but I wanted it to look clean). It may be a bit short if you are planning on wiring it to a switch on the center console. There was plenty of extra wire for the lights themselves in my case (fog lights) but I could see them being a bit short for overhead lights or reverse lights. The quality of the wires seems sufficient for most LED applications and the wrapping looks professional. I added a bead of silicone around the interface between the relay and the relay plug since I was installing it near the front of the car. I have attached pictures of the switch and lights, the pass through from cab to engine bay, the wiring around the engine bay for the switch, the wiring out to each light, the plugs, and the extra wire available. I have the double connector 380w version without remote.

I've had this on the RV for 3 winter months and it has been outstanding. High quality material, well made and has well thought out tightening straps. Definitely worth it.I installed the 29-32' model on our 32'4" L x 101" W class C motor home and it fit like it was custom made.  See photo. The crinkles in the photo were from packing and eventually flattened out. The first thing I noticed was how soft the material is and that even the inside seams are finished, so little chance of chafing. Installation was easy, but I suggest watching the YouTube video and having a helper. There are multiple straps, most being drawstring types, that are well placed to get a great fit. The straps that go under the chassis near the tires unfortunately line right up with the tire, so I ran the back one behind the rear tire and front one in front of the front tire. The little throw weights they provide work great to get the strap end tossed to the other side. And the tire covers are well made and pretty easy to get on. The rest of installation went easy, but its huge, so took about 30 minutes to get it all right.Over these three months, we've had snow, ice, rain, high winds, freeze/thaw, and one side gets hours of sun. I took the cover off last week and the RV looked as clean as new and not a single chafe mark. Amazingly, even though this is right next to a forest of trees dropping all manner of crud and birds fly over it (pooping), even the exterior of the cover still looks clean. The vents and A/C on the roof provide some pitch, so rain, melting snow and leaves shed off. During high winds, it just gently bellowed a bit - no hard flapping on the RV.Their are two big zippered openings for doors with Velcro attachments at the top to roll them up. But you'll need a ladder to do this as the attachment point is about 10' high, so I just unzipped it, left it hanging and slipped behind it like a curtain.If you decide to spend big bucks to get one custom made, things that would be an improvement over this one are - a flap to access shore power for charging, flaps to uncover roof appliances you may want to run, drawstrings to pull the cover away from exhaust pipes for exercising the genny, and custom openings for your doors. But for me, this one fits the bill just fine for a ton less money.

Great little bag for the price.  The color is chocolate brown and looks great on my bike.  The metal buckles hide plastic quick releases which are hidden behind the straps, the quick releases make getting into the bag quick and hassle free.  I had to punch another hole in the mount straps, but no worries because they are out of view when mounted.  I'm Very happy with my purchase and would even buy similar saddlebags if available.

Usually my go to wax is Turtle wax ICE. However weighing out the price difference, and reading some feedback of teflon wax, I thought I'd give it a try. It applies no different then ICE, however the luster and color of my 1 year old truck seems deeper, and I just polished it with ICE Detailer 1 month ago. So far I am quite impressed of this wax. I will update this I see how it holds up. The pic of my truck is showing the 1 week old Flash Gloss wax finish.

Installed these on my 2014 Corolla S. BE WARNED! You WILL need to get the 9th gen (2003-2008) corolla lower spring insulator, these will NOT fit if you use the stock insulator. The stock insulator is not wide enough to seat the spring properly. You can install them without the insulator but you will have metal to metal contact and get the annoying metal creaking sound.

So I bought these to replace the old, original driving lights on my 2000 Wrangler.When I went to mount the first one, the T-nut which holds the mount to the bumper completely snapped in two, and it wasn't even tight yet.Other quality issues are, the entire light housing is plastic, so when you tighten the light to the mounting bracket, the light is crooked.I expected better quality from Hella, I was wrong!Now I have to try to figure out how to mount these or send them back.I would not recommend these to anyone.

This has become my absolute favorite wax to use yet. Over the many years of car ownership, I have used countless numbers of various car waxes and sealants but this one takes the cake. It applies very easy, and requires little effort to buff it away. It leaves a beautiful glossy shine that lasts and water beads like crazy! I have stood inside and watched water just roll right off my car continuously during a storm. Use it on your paint, windows, glossy trim, etc. (It will whiten rubber trim) It works like magic. I also use it on my windshield as a rain repellent which does a fantastic job.  I will continue to buy this stuff as long as it exists!

I liked this tire a lot, could have been slightly wider, how about a 2.2. It did not last long though, I only got 1300 miles on this tire. 80 percent of use was hard packed dirt/sand/roots, the other 20 was pavement and rock gardens like John Brown/vortex at Santos. I ran it tubeless on the rear and it delaminated causing the tire to bubble on the bottom, 8 or 9 or so. One was about 1.5" around by .75" tall? This tire had a lot of time left on it, knobby wise. I have replaced it with the exact same tire so will see how that works out for me.

Let me start off by saying that I am not disappointed in these fog lights as they sit on my car right now.  The lights are "pretty much" plug and play, but not to the extent that they should be.  Please read on.***A special note I'd like to add to anyone looking to install fog lights on a Prelude 1997-2001 (bb6) and possibly other Honda's.  You do not have to run a wire from the cabin to the engine bay- it comes with one from the factory.  Look under the drivers side dash, right above the dead pedal on the left side.  You see that orange wire not connected to anything?  The other side of that is located behind the drivers-side winker/blinker on the bumper (also not connected to anything).  Pretty sure that was put there so the fog lights could be a dealer install option.  Use that instead of running the wire yourself***Style: Everyone has a different taste in style and preference.  I was looking for a fog light that did not stick out much different from the blocks that filled in the holes in the first place.  If you look at the non-smoked or yellow versions of this fog light, you'll see that you can clearly see them there whether the lights are on or off.  It makes it look like there is a big square light below each headlight...  not a fan. I wanted something that would blend during the day and only visible during the night.  This achieves that perfect.  I plan on posting pictures to show this.  There is a projector version fog lights for the prelude (bb6), but I have stock headlamps (no projector).  I'm a fan of uniformity.  Having the fog lights being projectors and not the head lights didn't work for me as well as this does.Illumination: These things aren't super bright if that's what you're looking for.  I mean, you're sending the light through what is essentially cheap sun glasses filter... it's going to diminish the light.  It's bright enough however that it illuminates the ground between the bumper and where the headlights start.  This is good enough that if I'm driving during the day in fog, it will allow vehicles in front of me to know I am coming without flipping the head lights and making visibility worse.  It's a safety thing... they see me coming they won't cut out in front last minute.  If you want a good comparison...they are about as bright as the parking lights in the OEM head lamps.Lamp construction: The actual material the lamp is made out of is good.  The back side is all metal, not plastic.  I imagine it can withstand the elements and heat very well (as well as disperse heat well).  The plastic lens look quite thick as well.  Seems sealed very well too.Drawbacks:-4th button mounting hardware: it's kind of cheap and the color is off a touch.  I had a heck of a time trying to get it to mount with the weak metal clips it came with.  Some how I finally got it to stick, but it's not *completely* flush.  The way I look at it though, it'll do until I find the OEM one with button in a junkyard.  Alternatively, you could just order the OEM one from the dealer.  I think it's like 10 bucks total (don't quote me on that one though).-No install instructions:  If you're not good with electrical work (if you don't understand relay's, you might have some trouble installing).  I had to sit down for an hour and trace out the wires, put a multi-meter on the switch and relay pins to figure out the pathways, and draw up a schematic to work on.-Illumination Modification:  As the wiring stands from the factory, the back illumination on the switch is always on instead of when the headlights or parking lights are on (do not confuse this with the light the turns on when the lights are on, that is different and works correctly).  The wiring is there to do it, but you have to disconnect it from the 12v+ constant feed and run a new lead to the illumination wire in the prelude.  It doesn't end there though.  I also had to crack open the switch and move a diode on the circuit board of the switch around.  Please note, this modification is not needed.  If you don't mind it being on all the time, and not dimming with the rest of the dash lights, you can skip this.-Mounting bracket modification 1: My first problem was the shape of the mounting bracket... one of them was not the correct shape.  I had to spend a couple hours, bending, and re-bending the bracket to match the other one (that fit flawlessly) to get it into the mounts points in the bumper.-Mounting bracket modification 2: the mounting bolt clips that it came with were too wide for the guide slots in the bumper.  Two ways to fix: 1. cut down the guide slots on the bumper (plastic) or 2. trim the bolt clips a bit with tin snips or a dremel.  Your choice.-Lift control: You know how headlights are adjustable vertically?  So are fog lights.  While these fog lights have the screw, the screw is already maxed out.  Screwing in and screwing out keeps the same elevation.  I had to put plastic spacers (1/4") in front of the screws to get it to work.  Didn't end there though.  The plastic clips that the screws go into are cracked in half from the factory.  So as soon as I tightened it the tension from the spring popped the screw back (out of the threads of the plastic clips).  I had to replace the plastic clips with metal mounting bolt clips I had from another project.  After that, I had all the control in the world (well to the point that the elevation can't go up any further because of the winkers/blinkers).  This modifications is not required though.tl;dr: The three star rating is simply because I had to modify them a bit in a few ways to make them work correctly.  Some were not *required*, but the ones that were were a nuisance.  I'm happy with the end product.  If you're looking for a discreet safety upgrade and don't mind a little work (or paying someone to do it), go for it.  If you *do* mind a little extra work, you're probably better off finding the OEM fogs.  In the end the price was worth it for me even with the headaches.

I am very satisfied with this product based on the quality and content of the kit.  I installed this on a 2015 Honda and it was a  perfect fit.  The kit contains everything you need including tucking tool, needle, thread, scissors, double sided tape and colored instructions. Note: The instructions are in Chinese, however, pictures are a universal language and I honestly did not use them. My only suggestion is that it takes time to install it and get great results. I spent about 4-5 hours so you need allot of patience.

I used it for the first time today hauling my kayaks 40 miles to the coast. I can say that it worked perfectly in combination with some Husky ratchet tie downs and soft ties. I have a couple 13ft Perception Pescador Tandem kayaks and this rack is like it was meant to haul them. In the parking lot I received several compliments on how well it matched my silver Ram 2500 4x4.

It wouldn't hold the bulb properly. I bent it back into shape; but the next morning the bulb had come loose again, and it wouldn't work.I broke out my tools and jerry-rigged it long enough to pass the inspection, and then I decided to replace the lights with LEDs. When they arrived, I was so happy with the first set that I ordered another. (I have a cargo shelf that's equipped with lights, too.)First, let me mention a few things you may want to know about these lights before ordering them:1. They do NOT include the wiring harness or the license plate bracket. The description doesn't say that they do, but just in case you were wondering, they don't. If you need those parts, you'll have to order them.2. They do have about seven inches of pigtails that you'll have to splice into the harness. The pigtails are permanently attached to the lights. You can't remove them. You'll have to splice them. I used solder and heat-shrink wire wrap. You could also use crimp-on butt connectors, but use the heat-shrink ones to keep the moisture out. I personally prefer soldering.3. The wiring color-code is standard. It's also marked on the back of the lights.Now, one odd thing. In addition to the usual stop/turn/hazard wire and the tail light wire, there's also a white wire that's supposed to go to ground. Some lights don't have this wire because they ground through the studs; and if lights do have this wire, I usually just connect it to the mounting studs. But maybe because of paint and rust, or maybe because LEDs are more sensitive to stray currents, or maybe both, the lights flickered with the ground wire connected to the studs.So I drilled and tapped two holes in the frame, threaded a screw through it, grounded the lights to the screw, and secured it with a fiber nut. They worked fine after that. I'm attaching two pictures so you can see what I'm talking about.I'm also attaching a video of one of the lights flashing. They're nice and bright. It was daytime when I took the video. I'm sure at night they look even brighter.All in all, I'm happy with the lights. Time will tell whether they hold up; but they're LEDs, so I expect they'll outlast the trailer.Richard

Did not fit a 1999 Honda Civic DX. It was also made entirely of plastic, not wire mesh as the description indicates. You can see the top edge has the correct holes to attach to the frame, but the bottom edge where it attaches to the bumper is missing all it's attachment points.  I returned it and got this instead, the fit was great:<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/OE-Replacement-Honda-Civic-Grille-Assembly-Partslink-Number-HO1200146/dp/B004GE5D1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">OE Replacement Honda Civic Grille Assembly (Partslink Number HO1200146)</a>

Got these as a gift about 10 months ago.  They are brighter than factory headlights and i was pleased initially.  But now after just 10 months, both lenses are cracked.  The glass is very cheap in my opinion.  I had original headlights for 10 years and only had one break due to a rock.  The glass lens on these is thin and fragile.  They still function, but they are definitely compromised now.  I wouldn't recommend them and i will be looking for some less fragile replacements.

UPDATE: Don't believe the hype. These frames are a rip off (I bought 2). Christenson and Nielson Trading Co. LLC are scamming AMa zon customers. I wish I had returned them as soon as they arrived but once you put one on you can't take it off without damaging it! The biggest problem are the chincy, poorly designed caps that go over the screws. Without them the frame looks really bad with the weird washer sticking out. Once installed (which is annoyingly difficult) but they cannot be removed without destroying the cover and likely damaging the frame. As I said in my original review, these are flimsy, and now I have photos to prove it. The thing started to fall off our pathfinder after driving through a deep rain puddle, and we almost lost the license plate. The frame bent badly (because it is super flimsy), and I believe the license plate's resistance to bending is what kept this thing on our vehicle. I had to take the plastic mount off the vehicle to get the stupid frame off it. LAME! Items like this make me want to stop buying stuff on Amazon (and I buy a LOT of stuff). Total scam product @ $20-25 a pop (price they were in July) with hundreds of 5 star reviews implying that they were somehow way better than typical frames. These are not worth $10 much less $25. Clearly this product is gaming the review system. If there was a way to flag it to Amazon customer support I wouldI ordered two for our new car.Meh. Seems overpriced for what it is. The steel is thinner than I expected considering the price and after seeing all the positive reviews. I got the email from the vendor trying to game the Amazon review system (contact us before reviewing etc etc) and it makes more sense now why they are reviewed so highly. If I hadn't already mounted them on the car (was waiting for these to put the plates on) I would return them.

Well....it's easy to apply, just spray it on and wipe it in with a rag. But for the price, it goes pretty fast, in my opinion. I got about two "treatments" out of the one bottle. I previously used another brand that is a thick paste and seems to go a lot further for a small bottle, but I thought I'd try something new. Anyway, I sprayed this 303 on, wiped it in, and it looked nice for a few days, but then it rained one night and most of it washed off. In some areas on the Jeep, rain dripped down onto my fenders and left white dots and streaks where the water hit the fender! I can't imagine what kind of petroleum-based product this is if rain washes it out of my fenders? Check out the photos; my Jeep isn't old (2102), so it isn't like the fenders are old as heck.Anyway, it looked nice the first few days until the rain washed it out, but now it's worse, because the fenders look horrible, like birds "dropped" on them. Maybe I have a bad batch, as I don't see other's complain about it.

Mine never came in the mail but I had one before and the LED looked white. This nothing ut a wast of money because if you really were a pro detailer you would understand it has nothing to do with the light just the name. You can get a stream line at 540 lumos or higher. That rupes give what 250?If you detail like I do for a living it's a waste. Wash wax clay every other week,it's work it. Don't get me wrong,Rupes is my #1 brad,just not worth the light. 650 Lumos was used on the car. Also,if you guy don't wetsand this Rupes will do the job.

I purchased this item specifically because the product photos show that it is blank and there is nothing in the description to say otherwise.

I have had this filter installed on my 2002 Lexus RX300 before. No fitment issues. The filter is simply the best cheap filter I can find. However, I prefer filters that have activated carbon in them, to help absorb outside smells. So, I prefer the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mann-Filter-MCF-1017-Cabin-Air-Filter-with-Polyphenol-Layer/dp/B00D3E1E5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mann Filter MCF 1017 Cabin Air Filter with Polyphenol Layer</a>. It is a slightly different design and construction of the OEM filter (87139-48020). Instead of being light, thin, and flat, the MANN filter it is heavy and provides as much more physical area of the filtering materials by way of the increased number of pleats. Compared to the other filters I have tried, this filter is much more robust and provides much better odor control. Simply by inspecting them side by side, you can see that this filter is much better than the original style.I value clean air so I try to buy the best filters! Every bit of help counts, hence I require activated carbon filters.  I have attached pictures of what an OEM style filter looks like against a MANN filter. When you hold the filters up to the light, the ATP, TYC, and OEM appear paper thin and light can be seen in abundance. Whereas the MANN filter, hardly any light shines through.Will I buy again? No! I value the nicer activated carbon filters (except the MANN filter).I have tested the following for my lexus.

I received the product in a good pakage, it was complety the part list to assembly to the bike, it was exactly part number for model year DR 650,  96 - 2012Before place a order,  many time I asked to the seller to confirm the real capacity of the tank  and finally I can confirm that capacity is 20 Ltr 5.3 gal., instead 6.6 gal. only checking the part stiker, where are write Acerbis tank 20 Ltr,By other hand the instalation is so easy only take oof  the original ones and assy the new one with components on the part list, and for better funcionality you could move the turn signal, because when the handlebar in fully turn the Turn signal touch with tank, I consider great product but the Ad must to be updated.

The color temp doesn't match OEM HIDs. It's not a huge difference in color and doesn't look that bad, so I was able to overlook it.Within two months I started to notice a flicker in one of the lights. At first I assumed it would be the regulator failing, my assumption was wrong. Given it was outside my return window I wanted to investigate.There are 7 PCBs in this device.Five of the PCBs are wired in parallel, that contain the LEDs. Four boards on the sides and one on the top. There are 3 LEDs on each board in series. The voltage supplied to each board is around 11.2 Volts given an input voltage of 12V.One PCB in the base of the "Bulb" to connect the led boards with the regulator.One PCB that I assume is just a current regulator.I did not take the time to look into the regulator board but it seems to only decrease the input voltage by about 7% up to about 25 volts under no load, so I assume it provides no voltage regulation. The failure was due to the LEDs becoming to hot because the only hard connection to the 4 boards to dissipate heat is the solder joint to the board in the base of the bulb. The LEDs in the tip also failed because the only hard connection were the two wires between the tip and the base of the bulb. The frame the boards set in is a softer metal, which I would feel safe assuming is aluminum. If there was a better (any) thermal connection between the boards and the aluminum frame I figure these would last longer. I also figure these LEDs were running past there maximum. Using only one current regulator when you have LEDs in parallel (or sets of seriesed LEDs in parallel) is bad practice anyway... and probably contributed to the failure.

After getting tired of hanging off the side of my bike to follow that white or yellow line in the fog cause I cant see anything infront of me I decided to get some fog lights on my bike. Got the piaa mounting brackets and everything went on and wired up in a few hours without a hitch. Have used it in the fog on numerous occasions and it does help allot with them angled down right, there are instructions on how to angle them if you are going to use them for fog lights. There are still times that I have to hang off the bike to see the line but with fog you just cant avoid that when its really bad, best to stay home if you can. If you have to go out in it though these work great for me. I also like to take the angeles crest hwy from la canada, ca over through wrightwood down to the 138 across the 15 and then up into crestline ca where I live. Its a couple hours of twistys through the mountains with rock and gravel debris around many of the corners once you get past newcombs ranch, not to mention you are contending with wildlife, bears and so on. So even if there is no fog I light these babys up when I am taking that route and when coupled with my high beems it turns night into day, I have managed to avoid all the debris and have seen all the gravel patches really well so far (dont want to jinx myself). I feel very comfortable riding that highway at night with these lights. Bright, Super White(makes my factory motorcycle bulb look yellow somehow) marked improvement in the fog. Worth the money imo.

This is a great step side for any truck. The rectangular shape is a nice change from most of the typical circular type. I love the black powder costing. It seems to hold up well to abuse.The install was indeed 2 hours or more (unless you have done this before.) make sure that you have all the bits and bolts that is needed. My package was missing 2 6mm nuts. Also, be careful not to over torque the bolts on the bottom of the step bar. I broke one off.Make sure to connect everything before you tighten anything. Makes aligning the bars MUCH easier. After install, this 200 lbs man bounced on it. Didnt seem to budge.

Went to use it for the first time tonight to lift our Toyota Venza for new brake pads. After just lifting and releasing 1 corner, the hydraulic fluid started to pour out. I tried to close the valve but it was not working. Then I tried to pull the handle out but once it was out, the lock inside the jack became jammed in a upward position so I could no longer insert the handle again. See the picture of the hydraulic fluid that leaked out. Returning this and will try a different brand.BTW I read the manual and bleed any air inside as instructed.

Dimmer then I had hoped. They are a fraction of the brightness of the factory bulbs but it still lights up the cab of my 2012 GMC Sierra. I'm not sure if I could read a map very well with only the two lights on. Overall I'd say I like them and will keep them awhile.

I ride a Yamaha WR250R dualsport. The less expensive one with the Blue axle shaft only doesn't fit! . They really need to offer that one with the option of which axle shaft you need. I purchased this larger 1050 version for the 17mm Gold axle shaft which fits the WRR axle perfectly.The overall use is straight forward however like anything there is a skill and nak to it. Don't be surprised if you can't do 5 minutes tire changes the first time using it. I've changed out tires with spoons a number of times and felt this was no easier upon first use. I've since done a total of 4 tires now and getting the hang of things.The overall quality is good. It's not overly heavy. The axle shaft, hand lever and pivot head fit nicely in a Wolfman Tool Roll though the longer tire lever it too long. IIRC it was 12-13" in length. It's also not a replacement for having tire spoons.It's nice and worth having but remember you'll still have to practice.

Nice trans cooler kit for 1989 K3500 454ci engine.Installed using Hayden Automotive 253 Metal Mounting Bracket Kit.This kept the trans cooler out and away from AC Condenser.I used the supplied line fitting to hook up cooling hoses, no leaks.Needed another piece of hose to reach cooling lines; Hayden Automotive 106 Transmission Oil Cooler Hose.I should have installed a oil cooler at the same time, but will go back  and do this at some point.Oil lines fittings are  larger; 3/4-10 fittings and take a different cooler with the larger lines.

2004 v-star 650 custom. Fit well looks good. Now you have to unscrew the top of the fuild tank and use the screws that come with it that go through the crome plat and the existing reservoir tank. Then I'm screwed the tank from The Handlebar and replace with the Chrome pieces make sure you do the top of the tank first and adjust your mirror and Brake pretty easy to install.

Love these bulbs.  Clean and crisp compared to incandescent bulbs.  Installed them on my 2012 Malibu LS, there is a length difference but I had no issues there (see first image).  Second picture is of the car in park without the brakes applied, they were pretty bright.  If I remember I'm going to get one at night with the brakes applied and add it.

Installed this on a 2011 FORD f-350 DIESEL 6.7 and it worked great.  I upgraded my oil pan to a steel pan found on all the ford 6.7's built after 2011.  I ordered the elbow for it so it drains directly down into a 5 gallon bucket.  The issue with the old drain was the plastic was a liability that could loosen off or brake easily.  I had to have it replaced at ford previously.  This little drain has a couple downsides.  It's slower to drain if not warmed up properly and does not have any magnetic function if your worried about that feature which my truck didn't come with as OEM so I don't think the ford engineers are worried about it I'm not.

About what you would expect for the price. It fit my 302 fine but the individual plastic wire holders just slide onto the frame and after the 10th time one pulled off I stopped and drilled holes in each one so as to put a small bolt through them. Then they worked fine. Well see how long it takes them to rust.

I think it's a product worth having in your car for those just in case situations for daily use. And if you're on a road trip, then it's upgraded from worth having to must have. It really covers a lot of functions in this device.First of all, it's a jump starter. Most other compact jump starters in the market delivers 400A max peak current. They work for sure, work pretty well actually. With this one, it delivers 200A more to a whopping 600As. It gives you a lot more cushion room in situations like cold weather, battery completely dead, or handling bigger engines. I test it with V4 2.4L, V6 3.2L and V8 5.0L. In all cases, left the car light on overnight, comes morning I turn the lights off and confirm battery won't start the car. Then wait for about 30 mins for battery to build up some surface charge on its own before I tried to jump start with Anker jump starter. All 3 cars started successfully. I'm in NoCal, temp is about 65F in the morning.2. It's got a small flash light. Not much, but it's good to have and its LED. I imagine in emergency situations, with its 15000mah built in battery, it will last this led light for a long long time.3. 2 Power IQ power on the side up to 2.1A/ port. When needed, you'll have some back up charging power, though I'd recommend for hiking or other outings, get one of those solar chargers.4. Anker was nice enough to include a car charge adapter, a wall adapter as well as a micro USB cable. Essentially all the accessories you need is included in the package which is kinda nice.If you're a road warrior, college kid with a not so reliable car, definitely get one.

Edit: 11/16/2010.  I take it all back.  This product is junk.  Took in on my third trip.  When I broke camp the jack was dead.  Checked fuse and it was blown and all replacement fuses blew.  Ends up the motor had a dead short.  On the road so I had to spend $300 to get a new jack and get moving again.It comes with a plug to insert into 7-Pin trailer hitch receptacle if you don't want to hard-wire it.  This may be too much for your vehicle's wiring as the jack instructions call for 10GA wire and a 20AMP fuse.The instructions are not clear about the polarity of the wires.  One is Black and the other is Black with Red goo on it.  Black is Hot (+) and Black/Red goo is Ground (-).  The housing is grounded so you could cut or remove the Ground (-) wire.The instructions call for wiring it with 10GA wire although the existing wire appears to be 12GA.  It was long enough to reach my battery bank.I hard-wired mine, both Hot and Ground, to my battery bank.  I included a twenty amp fuse in-line as instructed.Maybe you aren't as stupid as I am but I couldn't find a switch to turn off the convenient accessory lights.  It is hidden under a lip on the back side.It would have been nice if UP and DOWN switch positions were labeled but they aren't.I might have bought another but this is the only one I could find with a removable foot.  I need to be able to put a wheel on mine.7/28/2010 - Update.  Used this a month now.  Works great especially for lifting hitch and rear of truck up to attach WD bars.  Had one problem.  The twenty amp fuse I used blew.  Replaced it with a 25.  I'll see how that goes.One reviewer thought it was slow.  I guess that depends on one's perspective.  If not hard-wired, I imagine that would/could affect the speed.  It sure beats hand cranking.I upgraded this to fives stars.  Despite its quirks it has great bang for the buck.

Does not fit a 2002 Pontiac grand prix sedan gt 3800 series II no supercharger. It slipped out, replaced with another brand, and it fit perfectly, no problems, this one is about an inch shorter than the OEM one, slipped out the moment i put the car in drive. Amazon said it fits. An even autozone had one this size saying it fits my car, however they sell another one that is longer, that was the one I needed.

It's not bad if you are using for looks and not light. The bar was received and packaged very nicely. I put it on a bracket behind the grill of my f150. looked good but not very much light.

I'm giving this one star many months after purchase because like others have said, the regulated Flow side is in liters per minute, which no one uses & and is not clearly explained. Here in the US most welding regulators are measured in cubic feet per hour.  For example basic GNAW welder from Miller requires 20 CFH or 9.43 LPM when converted.  So it works if you are ok with at least some level of inaccuracy adjusting the gauge to account for conversions to metric LPM.

These arrived in 2 days with my prime membership. Out of the box, they were packaged well. There was a simple set of instructions that explained in detail how to assemble and install. The screws were machined precisely and took less that 5 minutes to assemble with no problems at all. Installation took about 15 minutes and went well with a helper as sliding the cross bars into the rails needs to be even on both sides. Both my rails and the cross bars were clearly marked where to center them and the cross bars are clearly labeled which end is forward with a eye catching sticker. Despite some of the reviews I read, these couldn't have been easier to assemble and install in around 20 minutes total. They hold our cargo carrier easily. They do sit up more than I expected, but are still slim and look OEM style and quality. Save yourself the OEM price and get these, trust me, I couldn't be happier.

Ok first is first these are not genuine Mugen pedals that out of the way these look great!!!!! For 35 bucks you cant go wrong I couldn't possibly shell out more than 100 bucks for pedals that Im going to be stepping on constantly it did come with some hardware but honestly it doesnt do the job pay a visit to a hardware store and get some nice looking ones.... the brake and clutch pedals were easy but the gas one was a pita i ended up using super glue to stick on the gas pedal and its on tight and put some on the rear of the brake and clutch pedal at the end result its def a great purchase just use better hardware and some glue to get the job done also shipping was extremely fast got here way faster than expected

Awesome. Lights are bright, and waterproof. I don't think 14 pods are enough for my 2014 Superlow XL1200T, so I also ordered the 10 pod kit as an ad-on. They really make my bike glow. Installation was a breeze, about an hour. Plenty of wire, and easy to connect. Not only DID I buy again, but I will buy more in the future.

We had mounted LED lights on our truck to take the place of our old "running" lights which were haolgen, and broken often due to placement on the vehicle from stock.In steps these Hamist 4 Pcs Waterproof High Power LED bars.  Just prior to owning these, we had those strip LEDs you purchase at Autozone and mount on the bumper. Two issues with those.  While bright, they were white background (so they stuck out ugly) and they were not durable.These LED's fixed these problems by implementing a single solid LED across the strip along with a nice aluminum border and water proof housing. The LEDs come with plenty of wire to run to whatever power source you use, but I found that the connector near the bar itself had the two wires (pos and neg) exposed to the elements. I fixed this by applying some plasti-dip to seal that off and allow for a total weather proof and no water getting into the housing. This is also why we're not at 5 stars.The bars are VERY bright. I could see using these for many applications (lighting in a boat, under counter with a transformer, closet lighting...etc.) Uses are limitless, but I chose to replace the LED's that had gone bad on our truck. A recommended buy.Note: I received these items at discount in exchange for the honest and unbiased review of the LED light bars.

One of the major eyesores that messes up the exterior look of your car is the ugly plastic plate frames that the dealership puts on your car,..the Ohuhu Matte black plate frames is the perfect inexpensive way to improve the aesthetic look look of your car . They really do make a lot of difference (see my attached pics) especially if you have a dark colored vehicle. I really like the fact that they have included screw caps which hide the screws and only two mounting points which  give a uniform look on the frame . The powder coated matte finish is very well done and the frames feel solid.Pros- Great inexpensive way to improve the look of your car, especially if its dark colored- Being made of Aluminum means that they can flex a bit with tightening them up , I have cracked couple of plastic frames due to the odd mounting angle on my car- Two mounting points and included screw caps give the frame a nice and continuous look- Good quality powder coated matte finishCons- At this price none.In the end I really like these frames and if you want to  improving the looks of your car without spending too much , I would fully recommend these platesDisclosure : I was provided a sample unit for review purposes , however the views reflected are entirely objective and my own.

WOULD NOT RECOMMEND unless you have grinding tools and willing to put the time in to modify this.I have a 94 sportster with the standard CV carb and it DOES NOT FIT. I believe this is only for fuel injected sportsters because the hits on the upper portion of the CV carb.I am attaching pictures what it looks like when it doesn't fit and how it had to modify it to fit.You can see that since the bracket hits the top of  the carb it creates and uneven gap. There for you need to grind the bracket to allow it to fit flush.

Nice roof rack. I have it on my 97 jeep Cherokee and it looks a lot better now. I would have liked it to be a little bigger but I was happy with it and the packaging too. It came with all the screws and everything but it had a few that weren't needed and it seemed like it was missing smaller screws. The only con was it didn't come with instructions but if you have common sense then you can put it together. I recommend it.

I ordered a pair of these about a month ago. When the box arrived opened and checked that everything was there. I finally had the time to install them today. I was really happy with the first one from the box I checked, it was a perfect match and the install was easy. Then I openned the second box and discovered they had sent a brake drum instead of rotor. I double checked my receipt and I ordered two rotors. It's one day after the return date.

This is good for what it is made to do. It has flexibility in where the two mounting brackets can be located according to your pump.I ended up cutting a section out of the side at the rear using tin snips to allow it to set farther back over the pump to clear valve plumbing on my pump, but that was more for asthetics than function. It is versatile. You can see before and after photos.

If you have patience and maybe an extra set of hands it is fairly simple to install. Comes disassembled, but good instructions to put together. Makes a great step to access the engine bay, and can keep your tow hooks onUpdate: Now a few months later of it being on im even happier that I have it on. While being reckless and dumb, I put my truck in the ditch on gravel at about 30mph. Whole front end is completely fine because of this. The mounts to the tow hooks are bent up but its still held on nice and snug. Worth every penny.

The install was a simple on my 15 Camry SE and true plug & play to my OEM 9005/HB3 harness, just as the seller described. Although the LED do not dim in DRL mode, the also do not shine @ their estimated 2000 lumen brightness either which is good as I thus don't have to worry about blinding oncoming traffic. In high-beam mode, they are just as bright as OEM which is great.Note:- due to the lower voltage in DRL mode, the led flickers but it isn't noticeable unless you stand very close to the car & look directly at the light. I have no issue with it

This is a fantastic intake. It was delivered quickly and packaged really well. The installation was simple and the instructions were very clear. The absolute best part, of course, is that sweet, sweet sound of sucking air when you get on it! Also gave the Jeepster a much welcomed growl under moderate to heavy acceleration.I can't honestly say if it improved my gas mileage. I don't really care, actually. To be honest, I've had my foot in it so much my mileage has gone down! But that's my fault, not this thing. As far as performance boost goes, it's hard to say. Again, I've got my foot in it all the time. I added an AFE Axle Back exhaust at the same time and between the two of these I have noticed that I don't have that lag between first and second that I used to have (yes, I know how to shift). That really has improved, but it could be the combo.

Worked as intended for my dometic refridgerator.  Installed, it and fridge works well again.  I did measure the voltage at the outlet and current across the element and calculated energy usage as 279 watts.  While I had the unit out I realized that not much air was flowing up thru the cooling coils and I also noticed that the drain hose was cracked.  I replaced the drain hose with 1/2 inch ID tygon tubing from jetsrus and added a cooling fan to rear of unit see attached picture.  After 4 hours the refridgerator was down to 35 degrees. Adding the extra fan is exactly what the fridge needed from the factory.  If you are not sure that the heating element is out here is a simple way to determine:  Does the unit cool via propane gas but will NOT cool using electric, then there is a really good possibility this is the part that needs replaced.  In the photo i installed a fan with zip ties, nothing fancy just need to make sure it pushes air over the coils.  Also make sure to locate it on the side away from the burner.

I used the VHT engine enamel primer, paint and clear to cover the corroded, discolored aluminum on my motorcycle engine.  I have seen other painted aluminum engines begin to flake and peel.  I did not want this to happen.  I cleaned the aluminum w acetone, primed, painted and cleared and cured according to VHT instructions.  This paint MUST be cured properly.  Until it is properly cured it is pretty fragile.  2000 miles and a year and a half later the finish on my engine is still in really good shape.  The paint sprays on really smooth and even.  Great coverage.  I recently had to strip and rebuild my engine.  I am here now to order more to re-spray it.  I highly recommend this product.

I spent about 1.5 hours applying it to my '02 Explorer's gray trim.  It looks great now.  I started out applying too little product because I was afraid the small bottle would run out before I finished the vehicle.  Once I started using an ample amount, the process worked much better.  My explorer has a lot of trim and even after I was done, there was still a little bit left in the bottle.  I will soon be ordering another one to use on other vehicles.Although I still don't know how long this will last...other reviews have me confident enough to buy another bottle.Edit 7/20/13:Buying bottle number 3 for another vehicle...the first use on my '02 was about 8 months ago and it still looks great.

I bought this with the intention of adding visibility. It does that, but I knew the halogen 1157 wasn't going to be bright enough. I bought this LED to replace it, which was the best I could find for the price:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/JDM-ASTAR-Super-Bright-5730-Chipsets-1157-2057-2357-7528-LED-Bulbs-with-Projector-Brilliant-Red-2yr-Warranty-Included/dp/B00WW28T16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">JDM ASTAR Super Bright 5730 Chipsets 1157 2057 2357 7528 LED Bulbs with Projector,Brilliant Red--2yr Warranty Included</a>. I also wanted to make sure my $10 LED bulb didn't get stolen, so I bought this hitch lock:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Trimax-T-3BLACK-Premium-5-8-34-Key-Receiver-Lock-Rugged-BLACK-epoxy-powder-coat/dp/B000W0RQ8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Trimax T-3BLACK Premium 5/8" Key Receiver Lock Rugged BLACK epoxy powder coat</a>. I also needed a power adapter to fit my truck:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hopkins-47345-4-Wire-Flat-Adapter/dp/B0002RNSKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hopkins 47345 4 Wire Flat Adapter</a>. Then I wanted to ensure it couldn't get any brighter and bought some red reflective tape to cover the insides of this:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Heskins-REF2R-Red-Reflective-Tape-2-34-x-10-yd/dp/B003EMZ24A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Heskins REF2R Red Reflective Tape, 2" x 10 yd</a>. This was kind of a hassle and maybe red reflective paint would've been easier, but less effective.As for the product itself, I don't like the plastic construction and wish it was better sealed from the elements. I wish it was all metal except the red plastic cover, and wish it came with a quality LED bulb like I bought, with an option to add a hitch lock and/or power adapter to this product and maybe this would be a 5 star product. Other than that, it fits and it works, but I haven't had it long. Hopefully with the upgrades I've done to it, it will improve its visibility.

This went on easy and feels well made. I tightened up the elastic just a bit to ensure the cover stays on my tire. The cover material feels thick and rubbery. It was a good fit for my tire and looks nice on our car. I included a picture of the tire sizing. Hopefully Amazon won't turn the picture sideways, so that you can make sure you get the right sized cover for your tire.Overall, I'd definitely recommend.

The display stand is nice (although the stickers that came with it do not stick to the stand).These clamps, however, are absolute rubbish. I tried eight of them. Two worked. Six failed just as they were getting snug. Four of those were nearly impossible to get off after they failed.When these strip, which in my experience was 75% of the time, they lock onto themselves (the stripped section of the band pushes into the grooves on the band under it). Then the screw, instead of loosening the clamp so the clamp can be removed, simply screws out of the clamp. Then what is left is a clamp that has locked onto itself, and tight enough to hold the hose in place, but not tight enough to keep the hose from leaking.I ended up having to cut some of the bands off. I was working in a tight spot on a car, so cutting them off, without cutting the hoses too, took over an hour. And, I was left with an inoperable car, because I didn't have clamps that work.Do yourself a favor and avoid these. They will waste a lot of your time.If you happen to find good, sturdy clamps, please let me know. I'm still searching.

Hopefully this is the last snowstorm of the year, but it did give me a chance to try these out. They kind of worked. I was trying to get out of my spot, and my tires started to spin. I put these out, but they didn't work initially. My tires just kept spinning, and weren't able to get onto the ramps. I had to kick them under the tires, and have some push me a bit. Once on top of them, they did provide an extra bit of traction. Unfortunately, I doubt these items will work if I try to use them alone.

Great fit. 2007 Silverado 2500 HD with 6.5' bed. Easy to install. If you have rusted wheel wells in the rear you may have an issue as the top 2 screws for the rear are really what hold these in place.  I actually had to weld in a new inner lip to have something to screw to.  Also they will cover your "4x4" decal somewhat.  I ordered new decals and installed them in a different spot once the flares were installed.  As stated good fit.  Good price. Looks great.

I'll give 5 stars but since I had to purchase the intake union valve from Lexus separately I give them 4 stars. The intake sounds awesome and car runs great.Update: after two months my car died. The Lexus tech found out the bolt valve for the ground cable needed to strip off the coated paint, that was preventing from getting power to the starter. Just another tip.

I came home to find my Zx6r's battery completely and utterly dead. I had already Bought a Battery Tender Jr for the purposes of winter storage, so I decided to give it a shot having nothing to lose.  I left the tender connected to my battery overnight, and for most of the following day. Getting home from work, I noticed the tender's indication light blinking green, which I knew meant the battery was above 80% having read the manual. I've since road my bike to and from work, turning it off and on without issue numerous times. I seldom leave reviews unless truly impressed, buy this product!

I did a test before I installed these in our RV, and now I am not sure I will be installing them.  It is better than having no cup holder at all, but it is disappointingly flimsy.  16oz water bottles fit perfectly fine and the support seems adequate to hold a full bottle (Image 1).  When the base is rested on a solid surface, soda cans fit snugly in the bottom and stay put really well (Image 2).  However, when mounted up, the base flexes WAY too much and the can cannot seat properly and just floats over the rim of the base (Image 3).  Depending on circumstances, I can foresee the can, especially tall energy drinks, tipping nervously.  I will be exploring further options before installing.

Easy 2" drop for my 2003 Road king, takes about 1 1/2 hours on a Road King because the head light housing has to be removed and the forks dropped down in the triple clamps in order to access the springs. Great kit, works, rides smooth.

The factory end was  destroyed by my wife. So I have to put in a new end on the tow wires and a bracket to hold it from dragging on the ground and being destroyed again I also purchased these covers and put a little dielectric grease on the ends to keep corrosion from happening.

I love these bulbs. They don't hurt my eyes to look at any more than incandescent bulbs, yet they are brighter. My photo shows my wall sconce with an incandescent bulb on the left and the warm white LED bulb on the right. As you can see from the light shining on the wall, they both emit the same color/temperature of light, but as you can also tell from the angle of the light, the LED bulb is brighter.

I have purchased twice from this seller now. On both occasions I have found this particular filter to be the correct fit for my Honda Odyssey 2005 model. I have also found the product to be packaged and delivered appropriately, given the delicate nature of the product (I read quite a few reviews stating that the product was crumpled and damaged when it arrived). As you can see in the photos that I've posted here, it comes in a hard cardboard box labeled with a Honda Motor Company sticker. On removing the filter from the box, it is in a plastic bag. It looks to me to be identical to the original filter in the car. The only thing that I cannot see is any "Honda" marking on the side of the filter itself, to indicate that it is a Honda product as shown in the product description photo. As you can see in my second photo, only the air flow direction is printed on the side (nothing about Honda). Having said that, you can see in my second photo that the filter is perfectly straight and that the ridges are perfectly aligned. Furthermore, the outer side of the filter are rigid, just like the original. I therefore trust that the seller and this product are legit (some reviewers suggest otherwise, but this has not been my experience with this product and seller). I've used this filter in the car for the past 8 months (that's why I purchased it a second time now), and I have found it to be a perfect fit, have no unusual smell, and it definitely did the job in my case. I have not yet installed this filter at the time of writing this review, and I will immediately post an update if I have any issues on installation (which will be tomorrow, 8/3/2017.

To be clear, I purchased mine from an authorized brick/mortar store--not through Amazon, but want to warn others.  Cheap plastic breaks easily.  The clip holding the unit to the base is poorly designed (mold seam at a stress point that breaks).  There is no backup retention mechanism, so once the clip breaks, the unit falls off your helmet without you knowing.  That's just the start of the problem.  When you call customer support, it rapidly becomes evident that the call center in a 1-person operation in Texas, and that person is Shaun.  Shaun makes lots of promises but never actually processes the warranty claim.  He promised to send emails and a replacement.  In fact, when I called back several days later (after not receiving any promised emails), Shaun answered again.  I could hear him fumbling through papers on his desk, then he said "oh, here's the note from your last call."  He finally sent me an email, but it was intended for someone else and their problem.  Then he blamed the mixup on "new software system."  Good grief--I'm not stupid.  So, after another week of no replacement or response, I've returned the units and exchanged for "the other brand".  Too bad, because after updating to the 4.0 software, it was a really decent communicator.  Good app, waterproof, good volume, good VOX....and really fragile plastic (as others have mentioned about broken antennas).  Cardo responded to NONE of the warranty requests I filed through the website form.  This could be a fantastic product, but the company doesn't prioritize customers.

I got these as a gift and Oh My God , they pop out and fall before my feet while I'm driving and cause me to not be able to push on the accelerator or breaks, at times, which is dangerous. They don't fit in properly, are either too snug when pushed into place or pop out and fall on the floor mat. Very frustrating and useless . Photos are for show . Not practical the way they were designed .

First, they look good on my bike. Black on black. However, mounting hardware is cheap, one of the peg bolts broke when I tried to tighten it. The clamps would not tighten on the crash bars, even after trying shims and rubber. I finally ran a stainless self tapper on the clamps to the tubes. also replaced the peg bolts with stainless bolts, so they hold better and I won't have to pray they don't break while I am riding.That said, I am happy with them and they look great. I didn't want to spend $75 on a set of pegs for a dual sport, but $5 more for better bolts and a tighter clamp  would have given a 5 star to this item.

Exact replacement for my 2004 Tahoe LT. I had trouble with ones from auto stores with some features not working with my car. I returned O'riley Auto Parts version due to it not letting me change the temp or vents. This one works perfect and I can't even tell its been replaced because the lighting matches too. Amazon is the way to go with these!

This filter came in a generic white box with a stick-on label. The label identifies the contents of the box as a FRAM Transmission filter FP6646. The label has the FRAM appearance i.e. orange; and indicates that it was printed by Honeywell Consumer Products Group - printed in USA. The filter itself appears well made and I think it looks like a FRAM P6646; but there are no product markings on the filter itself other than "Made in India". Made in India is okay; but the Technical details in the product description lists the origin as USA. The filter does NOT have any markings that identify it as a genuine FRAM P6646. It is simply painted white. I am inclined not to use it since I really can't identify it.......

Installed this onto a 2003 Ford Expedition 5.4 2v.  Came with almost everything,  It does fit differently than factory, "different gaskets" and the O-ring they send with the Pvc top port ( behind throttle body mount) does not fit and you will need to get a O ring for it. Everything fit into stock location. I can't say as to if it added performance, as for I replaced plugs, coils, intake and cleaned heads and misc parts all a once. It runs considerably better, but I can't say if this particular part added any benefit. My original OEM intake, cracked leaking coolant at the cross flow tube at 317k miles. I painted mine red. The image is after the install with Accel Coil packs.Torque down as directions say, and make sure you have a good torque wrench.I will add more as we rack up more mileage. So far we've gone 1100 miles on one Round trip to south Texas and back to central Arkansas. It averaged 18.6 mpg with 4 kids and two adults doing 70mph average. It was at 16 before all the additions. The additional power is nice also.

Bright and look great. The black bezel is prone to scratches, but its on a Jeep so who cares? The provided bolts will rust after time, even if you don't drive in the rain. My Jeep is garaged, and only taken out in sunny days, and it still rusted. The LEDs themselves are incredibly bright and can be seen from a great distance. The wiring was simple and didn't do hyper flashing with hazards/turn signals.

First off, when I received this it was packaged VERY well, inside a thick cardboard box wrapped in foam and edges were protected with foam guards as well. Not a chip or scratch on it.Install was straight forward and very easy. All bolts supplied are good quality and threaded properly.Looks amazing all bolted on and with red shackles to match my Jeep it looks even better. You really cant go wrong with this one.

First off, let me start by saying that I have tried other , cheaper LED bulbs in my 2015 VW GTI. All of them threw error lights that would have required coding with VCDS  to kill the light.These bulbs are BRIGHT. They replace the halogen bulbs I had in my tail lights and are as bright, if not brighter than the halogens. They can only be placed one of two ways in the harness so check fitment and test the lights before you put everything back together again.For the price, I would recommend these over significantly more expensive LED bulbs offered by some VW tuning sites.

Bought these back in December of 2015 for my 2014 TDI Touareg and have been running them for approximately 25k miles. So far, so good. Small price to pay for such a tasteful & functional upgrade.To clarify from the photo, these replaced my factory fog lamps, the LED light bar inside the lower grill was purchased by Quake-LED (that too is worth the money)!***Update: As of this week, my on-board computer is pinging me with a warning of the front left fog lamp being faulty.  Ordering a replacement set and will be replacing the FL one w/ another one of these to see if that remedies the error.  Having put a little over 60k miles on these, I'm willing to spend the money for a replacement set to see if I can keep on trucking as depicted in my original photo.***

Amazon states that it fits my 2001 Ford Excursion 7.3L but the pan design is blocked from application on my truck by the stock transmission support and vibration damper (damper removed in the photo).  Check your truck before you purchase.  Hope this helps!

Truly the best winch for your money. Super easy install with clear directions, easy to operate and I love the low profile. The many mounting options for the solenoid really do help BUT, be careful of two things...1. Make sure you completely wire up your solenoid to the motor before mounting to any plate or bumper or you will just have to take it off again to wire the ground connections2. I was forced to mount it over the motor or the power leads would not reach to the battery posts in my 2010 JK Wrangler.

Viking Pads are pretty much the same pads you get at the box store. The microfiber is a little less grainy and they a slightly thinner. (Thinner is good, you waste less product). But Viking pads cost less. Save yourself a few bucks and buys Viking.

I have an 04 Mazda3 with HID Xenon stock low-beam lights... I bought these as fogs (and 9005's as high-beams) to help match the HID's I have which are a 4300k temperature.Based on the reviews and what I saw I figured they'd at least be noticeably whiter... but they're not. They're the same brightness as my stock bulbs which are 6 years old now (never had any burn out). And they're slightly whiter but you can really only tell by looking at the pictures. I installed them on one side of the car and took pictures at night.But it's pretty disappointing especially for the price, I bought some PIAA Extreme White 7440 bulbs for my reverse/backup lights and now those are brighter and much whiter than stock. It's a huge difference and they were half the price as these (although different type of bulb).So I wouldn't recommend these if you're trying to match your HID's because they don't come close. I gave it two stars because it is whiter than standard halogens but just barely.

This stuff is amazing. I'll never buy another wax. I originally read about it on a truck forum. It lasts an incredibly long time, which is convenient because waxing my truck is a LONG process. There's a whole lot of truck to cover. I used Collinite for the first time about a year ago, and I applied a second coat in October. Wanted to get another coating before Winter, so that worked well. I also use this on my wheels - makes it so easy to clean them.It beads water so nicely. Does it's job creating that protective layer, and makes it easy to clean. I'll be claying and waxing again once all the pollen is gone, and will probably just do 2 coats a year (summer after pollen, late fall before snow). I'm confident 1 coat would be enough, but whatever. This bottle will last forever - this stuff goes on extremely thin. A little goes a long way.I love Collinite and have nothing but good things to say about it!

I bought this bag the day before our vacation and was hit with one of the worst storms of the year. We drove through hours of pounding rain with this on top of our car, left it fully packed in the thunderstorm overnight, and continued in heavy rain all the next day. Everything was dry other than a few minor damp spots right near the zipper. (UPDATE: I just looked over other reviews and saw that several people did not find this to be waterproof. I'm not sure why it was waterproof for us, but it was amazing. Maybe because we used a liner under it? Or because we packed it very tightly? The zipper was well above the top of the car.)Main Observations:* HEAVILY RUBBERIZED, extremely watertight* BETTER THAN A WEDGE: I thought I'd want a wedge because it would be more aerodynamic, but I actually prefer this shape. It's probably not quite as aerodynamic, but it's not bad, and it holds so much more.* WIND NOISE WASN'T BAD: We heard it, but it wasn't bad or hard to get used to, and I was driving in 30-40mph winds and hard rain. It is important to pack this very full if you want to keep the wind noise down.* ZIPPER FLAP: this flap does a pretty good job keeping the water from seeping behind the zipper* FOLDS UP into a very small package. I love it.USING WITHOUT CROSS BARS:The bag has four strap locations, one at each corner. There are two straps at each of these points, one to go to the side and one to go to the front or back.  Our car only has side bars, no cross bars, so I just took both straps at each point and routed them to the side. This worked great. It was plenty stable and I had no issues with it, even driving 70mph through high winds and rain.I did use a liner between the roof and the bag. I don't know if this was necessary, but it gave another layer of protection to the roof and probably provided more friction to keep the bag in place.Overall, I've been extremely pleased with this. I'm glad I didn't decide to go with a wedge bag or a hard plastic carrier.

Nothing worse than waking up on a deflated air mattress. Turns out a dog claw managed to shank its way through the top layer of our expensive queen air mattress. Thank god for this stuff though! Airstop was super easy and very effective. Simply use rubbing alcohol and your finger nail to peel off the fuzzy top of the mattress, cake this stuff on there, wait 5 minutes, and repeat until you are satisfied. I used about 3 coats on this 1.5 inch scratch, and success! Only took about 30 minutes and the air mattress is ready to go camping again. Couldn't recommend this stuff more.

Just finished installing these in about 10 minutes. Largely thanks to other reviews. These went on without a problem. You will need- a 13mm socket, and a metric size 6 Allen head driver.These lined up quickly with no threading issues. First off, remove the 4 (2 per side) 13mm bolts. Take out the top one on the windshield vertical pillars and the outside bolts across the top of the windshield. Start with the longer of the 2 bolts, it goes in the pillar,  once you have 3 or 4 threads started, switch to the top one to start it. Then tighten them a couple rounds each till the handle is secure. Repeat for the other side.These mounted very solid and are super secure. I will update this as necessary. Hope this helps someone along the way.

Do not buy, after around two years on my truck it failed. Usually not too big a deal, but after pulling it out and seeing how it failed made me decide to write this review. All the blades either broke off (which means they're in a cooling passage somewhere in my motor) out just folded over flat. When comparing it to the new pump I have you can see how cheaply made it is. I didn't pay it too much attention when I installed it but there is no way those ridiculously thin blades weren't going to fail, sooner rather than later. Please see attached photos.

I bought 2 sets of these to upgrade the stock lights on my tractors.  They looked like they would make good work light replacements and oh man, are they bright.  I put one on so I could see the side by side difference between the old halogen work lights and these.  It's like comparing a candle with the noon day sun!  The light temperature looks almost blue in the pictures but it is ultra white.  It's not hard on your eyes to use the light, only to look at the light!  I'll be buying more for sure.  In fact I bought these because I have a Nilight light bar I bought for a trailer but is actually too bright!

Both lights work great, I would give 5 stars for the lights. The company? Not so much. Turbo doesn't do the simple business practice of cleaning before assembly, they put these lights together without blowing dust and debris out from behind the glass first. There is pieces of cardboard, dust, and dried paint particles or metal shavings behind the fisheye lens.

I am sure this is a good product if I was able to install it. Amazon and the vendor said it would fit my car, and it would, physically. But here is the trap I fell into. My vehicle has heated AND adjustable mirrors. I did not need a a heated AND adjustable mirror since I have only used the heated mirror/defroster twice since 1999. So I saved $10 and bought this mirror since is it adjustable. Unfortunately the electrical connector is different so I can't plug it into the car's wiring. It would have be great if the product website said it WILL NOT fit cars wired for adjustable AND heated mirror.

I bought this for my 2015 Prius-2. The length is good, the fit (as it overhangs on the bumper edge) is right on, and the quality of the product is excellent. I recommend this to anyone who's in the market for a bumper protector for their 2015 Prius. However, and as noted by other reviewers there is no installation manual. So although the installation is somewhat straightforward, I recommend reading some online instructions before using this or watch a YouTube video.Three things to keep in mind when installing are;(1) Line up the center "bump" on the product with the trunk latch. I attached a picture with arrows.(2) Put the product on the bumper (before removing the adhesives) to check proper alignment/placement.(3) Mark the areas where the product will go by using masking tape or grease pens.Anyway, I also posted a picture on this review showing how it looks after installation. 'Hope it helps.

This bumper is awesome! It was easy to install, bolts to my 1994 YJ existing frame threaded nuts and l took opportunity to add 2 more thru bolts in existing third frame holes (to really need up the bumper connection to the frame.  The LED fog lights were so easy to wire (the inside switch small red light continues to glow when lights are off and turns green when switch the lights on; monitoring / no impact to battery so far).  I recommend this bumper to all Jeep enthusiasts. I can't wait to get my winch (shopping now). Have fun!!!

I read reviews stating the 214-2149 will work on my 06 5.3L extended cab silverado even though Amazon said it would not fit my truck and said to buy the $60 part. So for $12 I thought I'd give it a try. The 214-2149 is stamped exactly the same as what I took off my truck (PA-GF30). Slid the old one off the bracket. Used a small standard screwdriver to push the release pin up on the white clip. Cut off the old hose (was too tight to pull off and reuse). Used about 18" of 5/8 heater hose ($1/foot at local hardware store) and two clamps to attach the new hose. $15 fix rather than the $125 for OE parts.

One of the edges of the visor came off after a few days.  I tried pushing it back, but the next day found it to be coming off again.  Hopefully the whole thing won't be like this.

First off, if I could rate 4.5 stars thatd be ideal, but Im giving 5 stars because 4 is too low.I mounted these tires of 20 GMC Sierra All-Terrain snowflakes and love the way they look.  Theyve got an aggressive sidewall and a nice all around tread pattern very similar to the BF Goodrich All-Terrain TKO2s for about $100 less per tire.They perform EXCELLENT in the rain and snow.  Leaps and bounds better than the factory Goodyear Wrangler SR-As.Mine are mounted on a 2015 Silverado with a 2 Supreme Suspensions leveling kit.My only complaint, albeit a minor conplaint, is that they do have a small amount of road noise.  Its not bad at all and doesnt drone at highway speeds, but it is noticeable unlike the stock tires.With that said I still wouldnt hesitate to buy these tires if you're looking for an affordable AT tire with good aesthetics.

**The picture is without any flash, just my small door on my garage open during the day**I'm not one to make my stuff look cheap or ghetto so I gave this a shot and was impressed of the quality and looks. Keep in mind, this is just reflective tape... Same stuff they use on road signs, it's only visible and "glowing" when lights are reflecting off of it...Which can be very helpful when stopped at a stop sign or red light and a car is approaching you. It does not light your bike up like streetglow, but it gives it a very affordable accent to help turn a few heads here and there.I haven't received any comments on my wheels but I myself can appreciate the look. Also if you clean your wheels good before application it will stick well enough to pressure wash ( speaking from experience). Last side note, this comes with enough to cover both sides of both wheels on my 09 Honda CBR-600RR

Brighter, whiter and look like HIDs. Illuminates the road with nice crisp white light.  There is a very very small tinge of blue but it's barely noticeable. Would buy again!

Just installed so haven't recovered yet. Here are some install tips, the blue antenna wire is really black and goes on the bottom post with the negative battery terminal. Might be obvious for some folks but the way my winch plate is set up its hard to get to and when I figured it out had to take it off again. I mounted it on a motobilt bumper and wires are pushing against the grill but fits. I saw people complaining about no bolts but your oem bolts you took off your old bumper are the correct size so just reuse them. Will follow up once I get stuck!

This light bar/bracket/mount is made well and very affordable. It's a great design but I wouldn't say it's a "license plate bracket mount" as in it's not going to directly bolt onto your license plate bolts unless they are sturdy enough to hold the weight of the mount as well as any lights you put on it. Each application will be different and may require modification or or some imagination and mounting hardware for different cars/trucks. I test fitted it on my bumper and I'm able to mount it in the license plate holes, but I need to go get some new hardware and pull the plastic license plate screw grommets out of the bumper. If you're at all handy or you know that your license plate screw holes on your bumper can support the weight, you should have no problem installing the mount.

I tow a 32ft 7200 pound TT with a 2015 Ford Expedition EL with a HD tow package and the Husky Center line TS makes towing a breeze.  The setup was not hard took me less than an hour, it leveled out the TT and TV wonderfully.  Then on my first road trip in Colorado on the I25 I kept waiting for that sway that comes from being passed by a Semi Truck but it never came.  It felt just like being passed without the TT behind me, in fact if not for the TT in my mirrors I would not have known it was there, I was able to relax and just drive.  I was able to travel at 75 MPH no problem except for the crazy low millage at that speed.  I did not experience any white knuckle driving and the built in sway control from the Expedition never had to activate.  I previous towed with the chain and bar style WDH, night and day difference. For the price I think the Husky Center line TS is unbeatable.Will update if anything changes over timeAfter 18 month the husky centerline still works great, I have been caught in winds gusting to 70mph and the wind pushed the TV and trailer together (still had to reduce speed significantly)  During my last trip 1100 miles I noticed the hich was rubbing really hard against the head assebly when backing into tight camping spaces so I have started disconnecting the bars before manuvering into my site and it seams to reduce the friction.  Works great never any sway when being passed on the road by semi trucks usually keep speed at 70 when road conditions are appropriate.

I was skeptical about whether to get the outdoor mount or the in channel vent shade but the in channel totally kills it and is so much more of a cleaner look. I have a 05 Tahoe and it looks great on it. It arrived on time and was a easy install.

I ordered these for my 2016 Buick Enclave with captains chairs in the second row. Like other reviews, the front mats fit great. Only, the carpet to the side of the seats are not covered like on the 2nd/3rd row mat. The 2nd/3rd row mat doesn't lay flat and doesn't fit as well as the front mats. I think part of the problem is that they come folded in the box, whereas the front ones come flat. I laid 5 lb weights on the parts that don't lay flat and hope they help it lay better. I'll update again if it works.UPDATE: Laying the weights on the mats fixed the problem with the second row. I also heard that you could heat them in the sun or with a hair dryer to help them lay flat. Also, they cleanup with a vacuum quick and easy.  I like them!Update: I've had these mats for a few months now and am still loving them! It's nice to not worry about spills and dirt. I've found that the do seem to scratch easily, but look fine after wiping them with a wet car cleaning wipe.

I am really impressed with this light bar. I put it on my 1999 Jeep TJ and used the following mounts.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/E-Autogrilles-97-06-Jeep-Wrangler-TJ-Steel-Upper-Windshield-Mounting-Brackets-for-52-34-LED-Light-Bar-1-Pillar-51-0452/dp/B00IS94KME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">E-Autogrilles 97-06 Jeep Wrangler TJ Steel Upper Windshield Mounting Brackets for 52" LED Light Bar (1 Pillar) (51-0452)</a>It mounted up easily.The light is VERY bright and clean and projects a very long wide beam. If I turn my headlights on or off I can't even tell.Just be careful to have off if meeting a car inside a couple miles as it will blind them.In short I can't see it being worth it spending several hundred dollars on a light when this is available.I hope this review is helpful to you.

I am using in my motorcycle to update the lighting on it. I like them. No problems yet. I don't see any problem coming up either. I also used the amber in the turn signal indicators on the instrument cluster. They where a little bright so i spray painted them. Green for the speedo and tach and yellow on the amber ones.  I need to dim them a little.

These units have the worst mount system I have ever seen. They do not come with the necessary washers to install this properly. And unless you have fingers the size of a #2 pencil you end up doing a juggling act to work the nuts onto the Allen bolts. Without washers to space the to wide bracket, you can not tighten the Allen bolts far enough to tighten the bracket so the light will not flop around.

Just purchased a Jeep Wrangler and found that one of the things that they leave out that should be standard is a screen behind the grille to save bugs and stones from reaching the radiator.  I searched all of the screen devices on AMAZON and decided to go with Cocowen for two reasons:1.  It got good reviews.  2.  It had the predrilled hole for the hood lock that I planned to install.  3.  It did not require any screws or drilling or zip ties. 4.  It was "3D", meaning that the screen protruded into the grille openings.  Well, I received the screen, and inserted it at the same time that I attached the BOLT hood lock, and the process went well.  The screen is anchored by the 3D outpouching and is flexible enough to mold itself to the grille.  The top portion has rings that anchor the screen when the grille is reattached.  The finished product looks good.  I did not have to remove the grille entirely to complete the installation, only had to swing it forward.  So did not have to disconnect the lights.Just as some others have said, the sides of the screen do not have a cover so be careful with the sharp edges where the screen was cut.  Also, just as one of the other reviewers said, the keyhole opening was a little off center so that the rubber cap for the BOLT lock was difficult to put on.  What I did was to tug on the metal screen, push the rubber cap below the screen with a screw driver and then pop the cap on.  Now all I have to do is pull the cap off from the top, half-way, and insert the key.  This avoids removing the entire rubber cap and works fine.  Besides, how many times are you going to go under the hood?  My alternative would have been to cut the screen around the circular opening and enlarged the hole so that the cap was easier to place.  Using the first method works and I did not have to modify the screen.  All in all, I do not think that you can go wrong with this product.

Replacement was a 9005 High Beam in a 2018 Nissan Titan Platinum Reserve. Very nice light quality with an excellent light pattern when compared to the standard OEM halogens. Please see attached photos for an example of light output. Install wasn't as easy as I expected with the Titan and it takes about 45 minutes to remove the panels under the front fender but the results are worth it. Surprisingly the small fan on the LED wasn't as loud as I expected either.

I was very surprised to see this on a lightning round deal, so after reviewing the specs I immediately bought it. Talk about a nice bumper that is super simple to install!!! The fit and finish was awesome and did not require a relocation of the vacuum pump on my 2016 JK. I was also able to use the OEM filler plate (between the bumper and grill) for a very clean look. Now I need a rear bumper with tire swing arm to match from Havoc!!!

Very pleased with the final product. I would not say that the usable output is much brighter, per se, but the color is much whiter and the light from the housing is much brighter. The bulb does not throw light using the reflector in the same manner as the incandescent it replaces.I did run into a slight issue with getting the bulbs working. I know that LEDs are polarity sensitive, but the contact patches created by the single wire strands will cause some frustration if they don't line up properly. I carefully bent each strand into a U similar to the closed loop the incandescent bulbs have to remedy the problem. Also seems to result in a snugger fit into the housing.From an appearance, and to some degree safety perspective, these are a great upgrade. Pedestrians would be much more likely to notice that you are backing up, and the light is much cleaner than the yellow incandescent. I would say, though, if you are looking to use these to enhance visibility you might not be as impressed.

I was a little skeptical based on some of the reviews, but I've been really happy with this clip so far. The clip itself fits really tightly over the visor in my Jeep Wrangler, but doesn't appear to have marred it at all despite the visor being a plastic material. I mainly wear wayfarer-style sunglasses, and this clip holds them snugly without being a pain to remove them - I've had no issue inserting and removing pairs of glasses one-handed. I haven't tested this clip with any wire-framed glasses, but I don't imagine it would hold them very tightly.

These held up to a motorcycle wreck at county highway speeds. Front tire went to outside-left on turn, so rider did a sort-of  high-side superman.  Slid about 40 ft on asphalt then 40 feet in grass.  see attached pictures.  Palm plates were ground down as well as some knuckle damage.  Had minor scrapes on hands.  Would  definately buy again.  Comfort level was adequate.

Looked good and looked like it could handle the job of removing a flywheel. However after mounting it to the flywheel with the supplied bolts and ramping up the tension on the center bolt the metal started to bend and eventually the center "nut" failed and pulled off the "disk". I separated the disk and nut and discovered that this was cast steel and not plate steel and as such it wasn't anywhere near as strong as I needed to remove the flywheel on my Evinrude outboard. Ultimately I remounted it sans the center "nut" and even though I had a third of the threads remaining I was able to pop my flywheel loose of the crank. I wish this tool was the proper construction but if you need it to pull seriously stubborn flywheels this isn't a good choice.On the good side none of the threads stripped.

I have no idea where these 4 and 5 star reviews are coming from.  I never installed these as they are very cheaply made hard to tell if they're actually waterproof.  Poor quality connectors, looks as if the lenses are super glued to the backing plates, cheap wire.  Mine arrived with a pinched wire, exposing the copper leaving the wire unprotected and far from waterproof.  Very little quality control, fit and finish terrible.  Don't waste your time, mine are on the way back to Amazon.

EDITED!! Kuryakyn warranty sucks! 5 Star rating changed to 1 star.Installed this piece on 2012 HD Glide. Looked nice, but after 2 years the rear tab broke. Always used a torque wrench to install. Kuryakyn would not warranty it. While warranties are designed to limit liability, Kuryakyn should stand behind their products better.Especially when bikers who have 2 or 3 bikes are good returning customers and have several Kuryakyn pieces on them.ALSO... Amazon sellers are NOT AUTHORIZED distributors and Kuryakyn will not honor any warranty for their products.

I am very happy with these mats, they fit exactly as my original carpet mats fit, only I can hose these off.  They do show the dirt/salt more than my carpet mats did, but that's fine with me.  I just wish I could get matching rear mats.  I am considering the husky liners for the backseat, but they aren't as good a value as these at nearly 100 dollars. If you need rubber mats for your tundra, go for it.

This is my 3rd aFe intake I have installed (on my own vehicles; 6th overall)...and I will keep coming back and recommending them! First, their packaging is top-notch. All items are included and detailed pictures are provided with the instructions. This seems simple, but after multiple trips to AutoZone due to other intake systems not having all necessary parts (or incorrect sizes), this becomes more important. Fit and finish are right on point...I have installed over 20 intakes on various makes/models of vehicles and by far the aFe's have been the most consistent on the ease of install and fitment. To me, it is a great looking intake as well, which factors into my decision. I really like how the OEM lower air box is retained with this system; there are a lot of options with the 5.7L so all a matter of personal preference. I also ordered the aFe cover and will update with pics once installed. Now the sound...pure bliss! Not too aggressive or loud, but definitely gave the engine a nice low-end-growl from 3k RPM's to redline (still breaking it in so haven't pounded on it). Can't wait to hear it paired with my 14" Magnaflow! Also increases the throttle response and the engine pulls through the gears with more ease; breathes a lot better.The dry filter is a big selling point for me as I had a very similar setup on my WK2 SRT Jeep and loved it...inverted cone-top and super easy to clean! I will update my findings after a couple thousand miles

Used this rivet gun with tri grip rivets for attaching kayak accessories, worked nicely attaching four "j" hooks, two pad eyes, two terminal ends to a kayak. Rivet popped clean with no sharp edges. Came with four basic rivet sizes in separate zip bags. Be sure to use correct size rivet gripper that can be tightened with the included handy wrench in handle. My project was used with separately purchased marine grade rivets, didn't use the ones included with the rivet gun. Price should have been ten dollars or less in my opinion. See attached pictures.

Ordered these because my stock corner lamps started collecting water... And didn't match... And were old... AF! I read the reviews before I bought, and the one thing I noticed was the bad reviews all said pretty much the same thing " they leak". So I ordered them anyway and when they came, I broke out the silicone! Sealed them completely and let them dry. The silicone in the pictures is white but drys clear. Other than that they fit like stocks no problems installing them, and they look pretty damn good. If they do leak I will edit my post to reflect it. But I don't think they will.

I purchased the Weathertech cargo liner with my 2017 Ford Escape. It's terrible! It has been in my Ford for 1 1/2 years and it still will not lose the memory of being rolled up for shipping. I have place weight on the edge numerous times but it will not flatten out. The liner annoyingly slides on the carpet. Often it blocks my hatch from closing properly which means i have to shift the contents around so I can slide the liner back in place. Such a pain. My father purchased a 2015 Escape and purchased a Ford cargo liner. It works and looks much better then the Weathertech i have. I sent two emails to the company through their website and received no reply. Thus I recommend you skip shopping for a Weathertech products and go directly to Ford. You won't regret it.

I put this on my 1998 GMC Sonoma, it was kind of a pain cause I had to remove the whole bumper, but never the less it really helped having a car lift. I am really happy with this hitch and how sturdy it seems. Everyone in the reviews was saying it is a really easy job under an hour obviously don't live in an area where there is rust on vehicles because this took me over an hour but only because of rust issues. Overall it is a great buy and fits really well and I am glad I bought it

Fixes the horrible vibration issue on my 2006 Honda Civic EX. Common problem on 8th generation Civics (2006-2011), these passenger side engine mounts will either break/tear open or sag so that there isn't enough clearance between the top silver "lip" and bottom black metal piece. I purchased an aftermarket mount 2 years ago to replace my original one, but I still had a terrible vibration issue. I tried replacing the belt idler tensioner, installed new OEM spark plugs, even went to the dealer to update the PCM/ECM software, nothing fixed the vibration. Turns out, the aftermarket mount ended up sagging and allowing engine vibration to be transmitted through the frame of the car. After installing this OEM mount, the horrible shuddering/vibration at low RPMs (1500-2000 RPM) and during cold start up disappeared.Edit: The pictures show what I am talking about regarding the amount of clearance there is supposed to be between the upper (silver) and lower (black) parts of the mount. In pics 1 and 2, there is little to no clearance which allows engine vibrations from the cylinders firing to transmit through the body/frame of the car and be felt in the steering wheel and driver's seat. The third picture shows how much clearance there is supposed to be on a good mount.

LOVE this light.  Although I must say that I was very disappointed when my packaged arrived and only one light was inside. I had been researching lights for hours and they all came with two. I didn't realize that this was not a set. That was my bad.  That being said, two of these on the back of my new Ram 1500 would be ridiculous for what I use it for.  I just wanted a spot light (I wired the RED and BLACK wires to a switch in the cab so I could turn the spot on separately, then I wired the BLUE wire (Flood light section of the light) to my reverse lights; tip, if you have a dodge ram with a tow package, the trailer connection has a wiring diagram right on the flap so you don't have to take your tail lights off to wire the reverse lights; second tip, the reverse light is the Orange and White wire in the center of the trailer harness) for working behind the truck and reverse lights that would allow me to see backing up, through my dark window tint.  This does both jobs perfectly.  It is brighter than I expected it would be.

I love this, and it matches the new seat covers that I purchased (even though they aren't a pair).  As with most steering wheel covers, it was challenging to get on; however, I was able to do it by myself and it only took a few minutes.  I suggest making sure that you are paying attention to how you want it to sit on your steering wheel before you put it on (I decided I wanted the butterflies in a different location and had to take it off and put it back on to get them there).  There is some depth to the product, and so it seems to make the grip of the steering wheel feel a little different, but not uncomfortable.

I purchased this product to replace the tongue on my Triton snowmobile trailer. The old one was beat up, rusted, and out of adjustment.This tongue arrived well packaged and on time. It came with an instruction sheet and appears to be well made. It feels heavier than the original tongue coupler, and looks and works a whole lot better. It did not come with the mounting hardware but I didn't expect it to. It installed just like the old one, was already adjusted for a 2" ball, and seems to work well. Happy with the purchase.

One of my best purchases I got the smoked glass it look dark but when the bile is on it lights up and look like a regular taillight. When you activate the brake it flashes 3 times to let others know you are braking. Plus it has the integrated signals that is very bright and define. I was able to remove the two ugly OEM signals make the bike so much cleaner. I highly recommend this item if not for the looks but for safety.

Installed on my fury with very little work and a few parts from local store! Looks great and a great price!! Beats $180 for the other ones! I couldn't be happier with it.  For anyone who wants to know, I used 3/8 all thread, two stainless steel washers inside hole on plate to take up slack for the all thread. Two more washers and two stainless acorn nuts. Used a piece of rubber between plate mount and swing arm.  Like a few other people mine arrived with a lot of scratches but since the plate covers them I didn't care. Seems pretty solid so far. Been up to around 80 mph and it stayed right in place! For $20 I'm super happy with this product!

I love these lights, some of the brightest ones Ive bought so far. Ive bought so many different led bulbs recently trying to outfit my range rover. Every other brand Ive purchased is mediocre, SiriusLed hasn't let me done yet! The color of the bulbs are on point and they have been the brightest ones each time. Keep up the good work guys. I attached pics of the terrible lights that i fitted from another brand which claim to be "6000k pure white" and are actually blue. The SiriusLed lights show up pure white as described. Also the SiriusLed is brighter during that the day than the other brand was at night.

I has one with similar build from the other brand and I wanted to try a different brand. I was confused at first because this one reads 3psi lower than my first gauge. Luckily I found the digital Accutire and I confirmed this one is not working properly. 3PSI is more than the acceptable error at 3% or 1.8 PSI. This one was sent back.

Audi wants over $100 for one. Um ... No thanks. For the price, I couldn't be happier. I needed something to hold down purchases during spirited driving errand runs.As you can see from the photos this isn't going to hold a manilla envelope but larger objects it holds just fine. The hooks in my S3 are raised a little off the trunk floor anyway, which would allow smaller items to slip under the net, which does not bother me and isn't a defect in the product.

I have read many reviews throughout the net for this charger and they are all very good. I have uploaded a picture of what this charger actually looks like. The stock picture is the same model but they have made the front and colors look different the numbers are moved with a large baby blue line and the look is sleeker and cleaner than it was before (see added customer pictures and you will see what it actually looks like). Just want to make you all aware of the new look before your purchase. Cant ask for more from Schumacher,... great products for decades now and still making em just as good! for the price you won't find a better deal on an automatic charger that's a 50/10/2. Also if you live in California Amazon has a warehouse in Nevada I assume and they used OnTrac shipping service (which is only CA/NV based and got it to me in 2 days with the free super saver shipping! As always Amazon comes through again!

1st order of business is does the product do what they say? This one absolutely does. Plenty bright for a Lic plate.2nd is craftsmanship - is it designed well, sturdy, & attractive? A resounding,Yes.Finally is ease of installation - humm connect the Reds together, the blacks then connect to the OEM power & ground wires on your bike - the bolt size matches the hole size on the Lic plate, So another resounding Yes.I ordered the silver - thumbs-up. Also did a custom installation on the plate. I drilled an over sized hold next to and connecting to the mounting hole - so it's like the outline of a #8 with the bottom oversized. I drilled big enough to loosen the nut and slide the complete housing down and out through the hole. This allows you to remove the lights if for any reason you need to work-on or replace your lic plate. Remember these lights bolt to the plate with the wires running through the bolt. So if you need to remove the plate you'd have to cut the wires. This method allows a simple solution.Additional note * the wires are too small and thin for bullet connectors - crimping causes wire to break and/or break simply by having to pull apart and reconnect - soldering with heat-shrink tubing is a superior method. Ps. I cranked down on the nut plenty tight - nothing cracked or broke.Photos show the custom install for removing lights without cutting wires. Night time shot has ambient light coming from tail light and blinkers

A normal LED bulb kit at 4 Wheel Parts was $90 bucks, and those were just two bulbs. OEM fog light bulbs from Napa are $24.95 EACH and those are just regular 5202 round bulbs.Review Synopsis: These are very bright with a nice bluish glow to them (5000k white). The model is 5202 for GM fog lights. They warm my 2007 GMC Sierra 3500 HD Fog light's enclosure, but they seem to not be hot enough to melt anything. I took my truck out to a dark area to test them out, and immediately had a problem with one not wanting to come on after numerous off-on testing. I basically put them through their paces, as if I was going from my brights to my regular headlight beams. My truck will turn off the fogs when I switch to brights. I also wanted to see the difference my new HID fogs were making in lighting up the darkness. There isn't a drastic difference, but the type of light at 5000k changes my overall headlight/fog light color combination to a more white light that has better visibility than just my headlight halogens alone. After a few minutes, the non-working side came. Maybe the ballast had some issue with the on/off testing. I don't know. Let's hope it doesn't happen again.If they both stay working, I'm very happy with them. With the LED bulbs I had in them, people would flash their brights at me, even though I was in low beam (my truck is lifted 4"). With these, so far nobody has done that. I think it's the light spectrum and how it effects people's perception of the light as they approach me from the opposite way at night. This doesn't mean they aren't as bright. This HIDs are way better than my LED setup.Installation: Okay, so I had an issue with installation because of 5202 compatibility with their ballast, but OPT7 helped me figure it out via email and that really helped. It was MY fault, as the two #7 harnesses that go between their ballast and my OEM female 5202 dropped out of my box and after some back and forth on email, I realized I was missing parts. Good thing I found them! Installation under the bumper was a snap, and the bulbs fit the housing correctly, but there are a couple minor issues with other stuff. First, the double sided tape isn't something I'd use for my 4x4, as the ballasts would be lost in some desert somewhere. It's also hard to clean under a very dirty bumper in 27 degrees outside with frozen hands and everything freezing up as I go (like cleaner). So I used the brackets and zip ties, which are still on the might-lose-them threshold. So, I used the tape and the brackets and the zip ties, plus zip tied the wires in a half square knot so if the ballasts come lose, the wires will hold them in the field under driving conditions. I will probably screw them on at some point, just to feel better about it. Second, the #7 harness that goes between the ballast and my OEM female 5202 has two spade connectors instead of an actual 5202 male to connect. I found this to be a real problem. First, because the spades are too big to fit and I had to cut them with side cutters to go into the small pin holes in the female connector, and second, because I don't trust that kind of "mickey mouse" installation. Water, road grime, etc...will short those out or make them come loose in no time. No amount of tape will save those, so I will have to buy some male 5202 pigtails to do it right. These are $8 dollars and change on ebay. Solder them on and use shrink wrap if you want it to last. This issue eliminated one star on the review.Overall, I would definitely recommend this product, but if you are someone with 5202 lights, you will have to do a little more work because of those spades. This doesn't bother me too much. I'm happy with them so far. If that ballast that failed during testing has any more issues, I'm sure the seller will honor the warranty (right OPT7?)Buy them. They are cool. Video of my truck's lights attached. Also attached are photos of before and after on the 5202 harness connectors I got off ebay to adapt to my OEM harness. These lights come with pins to stick into your OEM plugs. The connectors I bought are in place of these pins and keep your lights connected and water proofed better.

I read a lot of the reviews here and decided to just go for it. This rack is on my 1992 Jeep Cherokee. So for starters, the price was just right. I didn't want a walmart rack, and I didn't want to spend 300-400 for main name brands.I didn't have any issues with assembly, just a few screws. I didn't have any strip on me like some reviews mentioned. My only complaint just like many others is the the mounts. They are just a time consumer to use. The plastic wing nuts take a long time to screw down. I replaced all 4 with lag bolts and a piece of flat steel (see my pics). I also bought extension. I'll keep my eye out for rust, but if it becomes a problem, I'll just spray the whole thing with bedliner like I do everything else. 4.5/5 for me.

Lets face it if your using this to quiet an engine noise than your engine is most likely on its way out. It will quiet a noise up temporarily but once it breaks down the noise will be back. You cant replace worn metal with a liquid, its just science.That being said even though Ive built a few engines, AND Im an ASE master tech, AND I know its snake oil, its still my guilty pleasure in my personal vehicles. Engine for visual effect.

I got these bulbs to use them as fog lights for my Nissan Pathfinder, they works exceptionally well and I was personally high impressed by their performance as compared to the generic Halogen bulbs. They do not use as much energy as do the halogen bulbs and still provide brighter light.I noticed my head lamps have the same H11 bulb size but I would seriously discourage you to use these as head lamps as they only provide 1700 lumens, you'd need something along the mark of 7000 lumens for head lamps if you are looking for LED for Head lamps.The seller did a great job at packing as well, they came in a fancy little box and well kept in a ziplockish anti static bag. I would surely recommend buying this set because they work pretty well and they are far better priced than a few other products of similar specs I saw on here. I attached it in my headlamps to be able to compare them to the original fog lamp bulbs. I have attached the photo below for you to seesidenote;I received this product with a little discount from the seller in order to review and asses it in an unbiased and truthful manner. I hope this review helps you

First of all let's get this straight.  This product is not perfect. But what it does is give  car owners like me a fair shake at something custom.  See,  I own an Infiniti G20 and it is very hard find custom parts for my car.  I have wanted to replace the bland taillights for years.  I found this and I am rather impressed even though I broke 2 of my lights removing them.  I sanded all the shininess off tail lights prior to spraying mine,  but when I replace the chipped tail lights I will clear coat all at the same time.  The finished product looks really good in matte though.  See pics.

Love them. Mounted on crash bars slightly angled out for riding forest service and gravel roads at night. I was pleasantly surprised to fing them perfect for highway travel as well. These are more flood than spot. I still want a good high beam option but these are perfect for low beam type use. Have only had one oncoming car flash his brights at me and I take that to mean I'm probably at the maximum brightness level before it starts to 'blind' oncoming traffic. These also have good cutoff on top so you can aim them like your low beams without having too much light bleed up into oncoming drivers.New LED on the left, old PIA's on the right in photo.

UPDATE: Nov. 2013: make sure the vendor has and ships the HP series version, not the inferior PS series.  K&N has DISCONTINUED the HP-7013, so gettum while you can.  : - (------K&N are known for making fortified oil filters, but I didn't think there was much they could do to improve the pleated paper insert that goes into the permanent metal oil filter housing on my 4 cyl. Mazda 6.Yet, the first improvement I noticed were the end caps that hold the pleats in place.  The Mazda factory filter, and all aftermarket filters I have tried so far, have rubber discs that are glued to the edges of the pleats.K&N have taken a plastic and dipped both ends of the pleats, embedding the paper into both end caps. The plastic is pliable and contains a bead for a good seal. All other filters use a disc of mesh around the center hole on both ends.I don't have the means to perform micron analysis to determine how much or how little dirt gets through the filter. But I will be able to tell come next oil change whether this filter has fractured and collapsed along the paper folds, as I have noticed with other brands.K&N include both O-rings, as do all other suppliers of this filter.  I do not see any particular quality difference in these components.Will update in about 2,000 miles.Using Mobil 1 synthetic 5W-20, combination of high-speed and in-town traffic.

'The Zone Tech Flexible Waterproof Green Lights arrived in 2 packs of 4 lights per pack. Each of the strips measures 11.5  so this gives me many mounting options for these great light strips. The strips are self-adhesive and flexible can be used on vehicles, homes, architectural applications and they are fantastic for DIY.The LEDs are super bright and a vivid green color and they are also waterproof. I am still considering how I will use these lights I was going to install them in the footwells of my truck but I am now thinking that they would be ideal for a project on my patio. I am sure I will be purchasing more of these versatile LED lights.I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

Price, appearance, quality, fit and finish are all top-notch with these.  Took me about an hour to install, but that includes removing the one remaining factory running board.  Also, had to move my blanket around since the driveway was approximately the same temperature as the face of the sun!But seriously, these are very attractive boards and really simple to install.  I would prefer one more support bracket, but they are solid the way they come with no flex or give in the boards or mounts, and I have never been called "slightly built" in my half-century of living.I would suggest that you count every piece of hardware before you start the install.  My boards came with exactly the right number of each item with no extra pieces at all.  That's good quality control and if I had misplaced something, it would have been on me since I verified each item in advance of installation.Once you figure out one side of the truck, the other installs very quickly and easily.  I am confident anyone who orders these will be very pleased with the experience.

From time to time you find products here that after you try it see installed you ask yourself how did you find such OUTSTANDING PRODUCT for the price you paid.This is a textbook example.This lightbulb came packed in such a way that you find computers and high end electronics. Inside the box a signed personalized note from Ed & Betty (the business owners) with a personal phone number for support - YOU GOT ME RIGHT THERE! - plus detailed instructions with pictures that enables you to install that blindfolded.Instalation could not be more straight foward on my 2000 Yamaha VMAX 1200. From beginning to the end it took me 10 minutes including a careful mod on the rubber boot that isolates the reflector. If I chose not to do that mod I would be done in 3 minutes flat. NO KIDDING, and I'm an OK DIY'ER.The quality on the build and how solid it is no wonder they have 5 stars rating.Now the function. The stock lamp is pathetic compared to the pure white BRIGHT LIGHT. The high and low beams are well distributed along the road and one guarantee I have now is I WILL BE SEEN. NO QUESTIONS.I am extremely pleased with the whole experience with the product and the Seller.

Installation Tips Below:I was a bit hesitant on buying it because I thought you have to be "perfect" with installing these but this kit makes it error (idiot) proof and is really easy to do it yourself.  It took me about 25 minutes, most of the time was spent on trying to figure out how to get the template location tabs to stay put.  It's one of those things you just need to do to figure out while doing and I hope my tips below will help you speed up the process.TIPS:The kit comes with location tabs that seat inside the lips screw holes for exact drill placement.  The idea is you put the tabs in the screw hole and then place the Lip on the trunk and when you have the exact placement you tape down the tabs and lift up the Lip and you drill in the tab hole template and you will drill EXACTLY where the screw hole is.  It's idiot proof.Now the trick to this is keeping those tabs in place as they fall out when you try and place it on the trunk.  After several tries I decided to lightly tape the tabs in place with painters tape (a small piece on each will do) which will keep them in place for placement on the trunk.Then when you have the lip placed exactly where it should be, tape the spoiler lip in place to the trunk (look at my photos) to hold it there.Once the Lip is taped in place then tape both ends of the tabs with tape to the trunk. (looks at my photos)Remove the tape holding the spoiler and slowly lift up and the tabs will be in perfect drill placement.Drill your pilot hole in the location tab template and then cover with tape for your final hole drilling (this is protect your trunk in case you misplace your drill) I suggest you drill the hole a bit larger to allow for easier screwing in.After you're done with the holes paint it with touch up paint, nail polish or coat with WD-40. Color doesn't matter because it will be covered.For the gasket tape:You apply it to the underside outer edge along the whole lip.  You will see where it belongs. I applied the gasket tape without cutting it going slowly around the curves.I did not peel the gasket tape first, instead I sliced the peel in the top middle and bottom middle and peeled about 3 inches for each side (4 in total) and folded it over to create a tab so that you can peel it off after you screw the spoiler on.  This allows you to not have to worry about getting the placement right after you drill the holes on the first try.When you are ready to install the Lip screws I found it was easier to start with the left and right screw and the middle last.  The middle is tricky, this is where drilling a larger hole will help.Don't tighten them all the way because you will need to peel the rest of the gasket tape to seal it.  After you fully peel the gasket tape then fully tighten the screw and you are all set.The paint match is perfect.The spoiler itself is well made and fits exactly as it should.The trunk still pops open without having to change the springs, it's not as high as before but it pops open which is all I care about.I am really happy I got this and did this myself.If you want one and are questioning the drilling into the car like I was this kit is basically idiot proof and if you follow my tips it will be simple for you.

These things are beefy compared to the factory mud flaps which are like boat sails blowing in the wind. These are a few inches shorter, thicker, and more durable. The inner is cupped, giving the mud flap extra support. I like that husky includes some paint protective strips because if you've experienced the factory flaps, you know they rub raw the area they are in contact with over time. If I want to take these off at some point, I can expect the paint to still be on my flares. If you are rubbing due to bigger tires, these can cure the burden as they don't have the outward bulge near the cab mount. Bottom line: for the money (only 35 dollars!!), these things are awesome.

The system has been in my 03 avalanche for about 2 weeks now.  Overall there is more throttle response, and when you accelerate heavier, there is more rumble from under the hood.Installation was relatively easy, was just a little difficult getting the mass airflow sensor to line up with the adaptor to secure it to the new air box.I was able to get the inlet pipe to connect to the throttle body without having to shave the upper fan shroud...it is very tight though, just keep that in mind...and others recommended a throttle body spacer, in my application there isn't room for that..

These LED's can replace sizes 158 (bright), 194 (brighter) and 168 (brightest) bulbs however I found the stock 168 bulb to be brighter than these LED's despite giving off a yellow hue compared to the cooler temperature LED's.These lights are great for dash, instrument panel and interior illumination.  They have the slightest tint of blue, most likely in between the 6000K to 8000K range when compared to the hue of HID's.  They are by no means ultra bright like many LED's that are significantly more expensive so don't be disappointed when they don't light up your car like daylight - you get what you pay for, but in this case, I think you definitely get your money's worth.Two of my dash bulbs in my 1995 Infinity G20 burned out and one of my instrument panels had been dark for awhile so I sacrificed a Saturday to strip my car apart to get at all the bulbs.  It was quite the endeavor but well worth it.  Look for my pictures to see comparisons of before and after.  I used a combination of these 5-SMD LED's and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/8x-T10-194-168-501-4-smd-3528-LED-Car-Light-Bulb-White/dp/B0047RKS72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">8x T10 194 168 501 4-smd 3528 LED Car Light Bulb White</a>&nbsp;to compare the output but did not notice a difference.  I concluded behind any panel, the light output was negligible between the two.  However, in open spaces like trunks, door step lights and dome lights, these omnidirectional LED's performed much better.One of my secondary headlight bulbs had also burned out so I tested one of these LED lights there as well.  Again, both the 4-SMD directional LED's and these 5-SMD omnidirectional LED's looked the same.

From far away though, it wasn't as noticeable as the pictures make them out to be and since these bulbs cost significantly less than a filament bulb, I left it in.  I changed out my girlfriends 2008 Honda Accord's door lights as well and they looked fantastic.None of the bulbs I received were defective.  If you have any problems with the lights flickering or not making good contact, I would suggest bending the wires outward at the base of the lights to provide better connectivity.

OK, but smaller than I thought it would be.  See photos.  1st hole can't be used on my '16 Trailhawk, as it hits recovery hook.  Photos show 2nd hole mounting.  Can be seen in rearview camera, and I like that for aiming when I back into spaces.See new photos 4 and 5.  Product prevented major damage to my Bumper/QP after backing into a concrete barrier around a lamppost.  Just bought another one.

For starters, obviously its an organizer and that it does.  Its easily great for the car, but the house, work, this organizer is great for keeping things where they need to be.  This guy has durable handles meaning it can carry my cargo where ever I need it to go.Groceries can be a pain, the LotFancy Auto Trunk Organizer means items I bagged stay in the bag and can be easily carried in side, depending on weight and my personal ability to carry, all at one time.  Warehouse club visit?  Easy to store boxed items and even those fruits and veggies.This is also great if you drive a clunker, that is always going through fluids. Easy to organize the antifreeze, oil, windshield fluid and more all in the unit, and likely have the other side free for storing other stuff.  The mesh side makes a great place for storing smaller items that are great to have (microfiber towel, tools, and so on).Assembly is a snap, just pop it open and slide down the bottoms to give it rigidly.  Need the extra space for something else?  The unit folds flat instantly, great space saving design.

This is a 33x11.5 tire in a GM truck bed. By standing up the tire, you barely use any space, especially the space right up front on the side. Install was simple and typical padlock fit in the rod hole. No drilling. Looks incredible when you have a full-size matching spare and nice wheels.  Very unique look that reminds me of the 1960s/70s Jeep pickups. On a long bed, you could put this behind the wheel well. If you absolutely need access to the front floor corner clear for a dirt bike tie down point, make sure you set it up with enough clearance.Update: After a week or so of use, I can still say it works great. For a 100lb wheel+tire, you need to make sure its on there tight. Re-check after installing every day. Also demoting to 4 stars because $75 is crazy for what probably costs $5 in materials and labor time.

These small lights are perfect for reading. Because they're adjustable, you can point them to wherever you need to provide a small amount of light. My pair are installed on either side of the sofa. I love how they stay cool. Especially, since they are right beside your head!

Cap fits and works perfectly. The O-Ring is just fine on the one I bought. The top may have stuck well on it's own but I just went ahead and used a bit of Super Glue to help make sure it bonds correctly the first time. If there are any issues with this in the future I will update this review. So far it has been a week and it is just fine!

Worked perfectly on 2" Two Brothers Racing dual exhaust I out on my rzr 900 XP. This isn't cheap, if you have any way of having a shop weld the bung in and, AND cut the hole for about $30, maybe even $50 might be worth it, if like me you don't have a drill bit or stepped bit already to make a 7/8" hole. I had to buy this bit and for this rather large hole they are kinda pricey. I paid $51 for a stepped bit after I bought a most excellent set here for $14, but didn't notice it was one size too small for my sensor. So buy the time I added all the tools needed and parts, I was at a cool $100 to install a Dynojet Autotuner onto my new pipes. I did all this at my own pace in my garage and it works perfectly, able to check and double check the best area for best fit, so for this I paid the money, if you have the tools then the price for install is substantially lowered obviously.  I will add this was the first time I remember using a stepped bit and I have to say, I could have bought a straight 7/8" for half the price, but will use this extra bit maybe 30X before ever needing or using a straight bit in that size, and the ease of use was outstanding, for cutting into round tubing they are far quicker then graduating up to size with pilot bits.  I give it five stars for quality and overall fitment, worked as advertised and nary a leak, solid and tight, now I have a threaded bung to add fuel/air gauge or whatever I need in the future, and it's pretty heavy duty, in no way cheap, directions were a little scarce but complete, and comes with enough gasket to make the fit solid, it might as well be welded because it's part of the pipe now.Added: I see some reviewers talking about the adhesive and it's "one time use", I have to take issue with this, there is adhesive, on the gasket material. There is no need for "adhesive" as this is out on mechanically (bolted down/on) and the adhesive is there to help keep gasket material from slipping out of place as you wrest the item over it, which is a good idea, this material is paramount to a perfect seal, the glued backing is just a plus, an addition to make this part of assembly easier. So to wrap this up, this item needs no glue/tape/adhesive to work, it does in fact need a small amount of gasket as designed to seal properly, the backing is sticky to aid in application of this gasket, indeed it won't stick so well you cannot move it if it sticks on accident to something before your ready, it won't stick numerous times either, it will aid you in holding it where you need it to make the seal.

I am enjoying This ! So many features !  Still, and VIDEO Camera ! .,.  Bluetooth with My Cell Phone, and OTHER riders too.  .,..,. Plus FM RADIO., And interface with some Garmin GPS'. Only I could not find any Printed Information on, (1), how to DOWNLOAD pis, and vids.

I'm a big fan of TMH products, and have used them for years under harsh conditions.LED Village provided me one of these to test out and review, and I'm blown away by how much light this tiny lamp puts out.It's nicely cast Aluminum, super smooth finish, and powder coated a satin black.  It comes with plated steel mounting hardware that allows you to aim it where you need it and lock it in place.These throw light pretty far considering they are flood lamps.  In one of the photos you can see the light washes almost 150 degrees side to side.  They draw 1 Amp at 12 volts, and stay cool to the touch.These would be perfect for outdoor equipment, off-road spot lights, and the small current draw means you could put them on just about anything with a 12V electrical system.  They are low ESR, and the voltage drop on a really small 12V power supply was less than 1 volt.Make sure you buy these from a reputable seller like LED Village.  There are plenty of Knock offs, and they don't stand up to the real deal.  Look for TMH on the wire jackets, and a hologram logo.Great buy!

See photo: the tube has a dent where it was held in the bending machine. You can see the clamp marks clearly. Some worker just packaged the dented pipe. Some quality control maybe? It's fine if you are making tractor or motorhome parts, but I have a nice race car and am customizing things. $56 for this to extend my fenderwell headers before going to the ceramic coater tomorrow and there is a pretty dent right where it will be the most visible. AVOID. I would love a refund.

Addendum... Lights are bright but the cheap plastic melted and warped in the sun. See pics and be warned.Okay... These are the best lights you will buy for the money.  They are a little larger than others, but they are so bright your eyeballs will probably melt right out of your skull if you look into them.These are way better than the 16-LED "High Intensity" units out there, and are probably the best warning lights I have found after a LOT of trial and error.  Skip the others... get these first.

Look like cheap plastic trash, but are actually well made, nicely machined brackets. These fit my 3in bull bars very well. The included allen wrenches made adjustment fast and easy. They also come with a thin rubber strip to help with grip and prevent marring. I have some Hella spots on these and they hold them very well and look good while their doing it. Nice paint finish on the aluminum itself. Other hardware is rust proof. Simple, easy to adjust angles so your lites aim right where you want them. Would buy again.

I decided to replace a new, never used 300 series that came with my 2018 model year camper with this much nicer model. The base (where the flush valve is) is plastic and identical to the 300, but the bowl is elongated ceramic with a full rim. The enameled wooden seat is much nicer than the plastic one on the 300. The elongated bowl is perfect for the larger gentleman.This toilet requires a little more "rough in" room from the flange to the back wall, so make sure you've got the space. It calls for 11", but it's actually a bit less. The good thing is that since this throne sits a little closer to the wall, it doesn't take up any extra floor space in the front of the toilet.Installation was a breeze. 2 flange bolts and a water line. Took me all of 5-10 minutes to remove the old one and install the new. Since I was replacing a brand new toilet, I just re-used hardware that came with the camper. There was no need to open the kit that came with my 320.Rating it at 4 stars for now, since I haven't been able to test it. The camper is winterized. I'll be sure to update my review once I can see how well it flushes and cleans the bowl.

Works great. I had to change my factory 7 pin plug because I upgraded to a heavy duty hitch vs the factory one that was too small and I lost my mounting bracket that was attached from factory.There was someone else who talked about how flimsy the mounting bracket is and I have to say that has not been my experience. Used a couple oversized self tapping 5/16 sheet metal screws to hold it down screwed it in and it works perfect.Install was simple and sweet, wired into my Factory 01 Dodge Ram 2500 Cummins with butt connectors and heat shrink tubing, then taped it all up to protect any exposed wires. Will put up the wiring schematic for 2nd gen 98.5-02 rams if anyone else needs the info. Might be same for other Dodges, but I can't say.Center= purple/black tracer PL/BK back up lights1 o'clock= red/orange tracer RD/OR 12v Power3 o'clock= brown/red tracer BR/RD Right turn and brake5 o'clock= light blue LB Brake Controller7 o'clock= Black BK Ground , (mine has two black wires)9 o'clock= Green/red tracer GR/RD Left turn and brake11 o'clock= Black/orange tracer BK/OR Running lights.

I was upgrading my gauge cluster to LED bulbs and had enough left over to convert my interior of my 2001 Accord to LED lights as well. This was the missing piece to change over my main cabin light to an LED bulb.Easy seamless installation, keep in mind that LEDs require correct polarity so if it doesn't light up when you first put it in flip it around and it should work.

Just got this in and on.......fastest upgrade ever. One screw on tail of seat out. Pull off seat. Wipe clean resting points with provided pad. Peal off 3m tape adhesive cover. Install and apply pressure to 3m tape adhesive areas for 30 sec.Install seat back on. Put on a drop of blue thread lock to screw. Put in in and torque it down.......finished!Stand back an marvel the new look. Added a touch of class as well as a working heat shield. I fired up the bike and let it get up to temp. Put my butt in the saddle and my hand down over the top on the shield. Normally I can feel the heat right away on my hand.Bingo!.....heat is redirected up and away from leg area. Plus adds a nice custom look.Awesome upgrade!

Seems built well. Very bright. Mounted it to my Can-am Maverick. Would buy again.UPDATE: I installed this on my mav a few months ago, not it has a bunch of light inside the glass. I emailed the company to ask them about how to get it replaced and they said they would only replace it if lights were going out and that i just need to give it time to "let the water vent"So finally i emailed them back because the water has been in there for a few months now and is only getting worse and they said i could send it back and they "would look at it". Get what you pay for.

First off install was pretty easy with included hardware. Just pop out four fastened slide it underneath then when you put each of the new fasteners make sure to align properly. (May not think it will line up but it will.) Once aligned before you put the screw all the way in, push the housing piece all the way in and hold tight. I had a small electric screw driver which I used to help him push and screw at the same time. You will hear a pop which means it's all the way in. Go back and untuck the rubber seal as much as you can. I'm sure a regular screw driver will work the same but that was the closest to me. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because after I installed I realized 2 of he 4 clear good protectors were not included and there was a small scratch on it. Did not feel like undoing the whole thing and returning because of that. Took me all but 25 minutes. Listen to my instructions and I bet you can do it in at least 15 minutes.

The bulb fits perfectly and the color is great, however, it causes the bulb failure light to come on. The first photo shows the OEM bulb and the second is the LED. There's a drastic difference in the color and brightness of the bulb.I'm currently ordering the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Philips-5W-Vision-LED-CAN-bus-Warning-Canceller-2-Pack/dp/B00P2D46W8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Philips 5W Vision LED CAN-bus Warning Canceller, 2 Pack</a>&nbsp;to see if it fixes the issue. All the canceller consists of is a resistor with a heat sink, so I guess we'll see if it's worth the price. What is unfortunate is the canceller actually costs more than the bulbs...Ultimately, if you have a vehicle that doesn't check the bulb, you should be good to go.

Bumper was as pictured, packaged well and came with all hardware needed including screws and nuts for the fog lights. I see some negative assumptions in the questions so there you have it! Time will tell how it stands up to the weather but for now...awesome bumper! **4 stars because it came with some rust or welding dust in it.

THESE ARE NOT SUBMERSIBLE! There's a small opening on the bottom side of these where the wiring comes through into where the bulb is.Aside from that, they're great! I had planned on mounting these plenty above where water wouldn't reach just to keep them from seeing extra abuse, so I wasn't upset about them not being submersible. Wiring was a cake walk too. I've had these hooked up in heavy rain and they still work great. In my opinion, if you advertise them as submersible then they should be submersible. That's the only reason I gave it 3 stars. If they were indeed submersible, I would have given 5 stars.

This worked great on our 2016 Forester with a Ford E450 Superduty chassis.  Comes with all hardware.  6 bolts total, 4 bolts use holes already there in the hood, and 2 are self taping metal screws.  Following the instructions and it was easy to install....I did have to dremel out 2 of the holes in the deflector wider so it could align with the screw holes in the hood...30 mins max!

These were used as replacements for my 1953 M38A1 Willys Jeep. I have them connected in series for 24 volts and so far, they have performed flawlessly. I also connected a trickle charger adaptor, after making it longer, so that it could be sent through the firewall and allow for easy connections to my 24 volt charger. Anyone who's familiar with this Jeep knows why that is important because getting to the batteries is a pain having to remove 8 bolts just to get the cover lid off. The extended charger eliminates this task and makes maintenance simple. The batteries also were braced using the same shipping foam that comes from Optima that protects the batteries in transit. I am very happy with my purchase and I paid $163.00 each at the time of purchase so I feel that I got a great deal from Amazon! I also use a Genius 24V charger that I also bought on Amazon to maintain them and keep them fully charged.

I bought two of these warhawks for both of my helmets and they not only add a really cool look, but added safety when paired with the customTAYLOR33 warhawk reflective decals. The rubber is extremely thick, but easy to cut and trim to size with a sharp razor blade. The adhesive is VERY STRONG...like, I literally pick up my helmet by the warhawk now. (Probably not recommended over time, but just giving an idea of how strong it holds) Just make sure that you clean your helmets surface with some rubbing alcohol prior to sticking!

Read a full review with photos on the 1995Wrangler blog.After some amount of consideration, and checking with the boss, I decided instead to go with the E-Autogrilles front bumper, just over $200 with free shipping. They have several to pick from. And they look just like some of the other brands out there. Shipping was quick and the bumper came well packed. There WILL be drilling needed for a YJ install so make a template and double check the holes. It was a bit of a pain to get it to line up all the holes.PROs:The price. You pay for what you get, if you want more they make a heavy duty version with lights.The look. Beefy and makes the wife feel safe.The packing. It would survive Armageddon. No scratched or dents.Welded hoop protects the front of the Jeep Wrangler TJ/YJ.Two tabs on pre-runner hoop for extra off-road lights.CONs:The holes don't line up, even though the specs said NO drilling or cutting.Powder coat is a bit thin, but looks good.Winch area is going to need reinforcement.

I installed this chrome grille on my 1997 Ford Ranger XLT.  I paired it with an&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Anzo-USA-111119-Ford-Ranger-Clear-With-Amber-Corners-Headlight-Assembly/dp/B0038AZMXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Anzo USA 111119 Ford Ranger Clear With Amber Corners Headlight Assembly</a>&nbsp;and an&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Auto-Ventshade-21011-Low-Profile-Hoodflector/dp/B000CBTGGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Auto Ventshade 21011 Low Profile Hoodflector</a>.  The combination brightened up the front end of the ol' truck and took off quite a few years.  It looks good, but the fit is terrible.Pros:- Nice, shiny chrome.  Edges are finished nicely, and the finish is even.- Reuses existing hardware.  Be sure to retain the mounting screws, the blue oval Ford emblem and nuts, and two rubber bumpers on the bottom fingers of the OEM grille.- The plastic appears to be as thick and as robust as the OEM grille.Cons:- Drop-in fit is average to below average.  The grille is about 3/4" too short from right to left.  It has square cutouts that are supposed to lock into place in the existing turn signal bezel chrome, but both ends were too short to reach and no amount of fiddling would work.  I had to use a Dremel to cut off extra plastic so that the grille would lay flat near the turn signal bezel chrome.- Because it's too short from left to right, I had to screw in a couple of the screws at an angle because the screw holes in the grille did not line up with the screw holes in the truck.- The grille is about 1/2" too short top to bottom.  There are plastic fingers on the bottom that extend downward to hold the bottom in place.  The right side fingers do not extend down far enough to securely hold it in place.  I'm hoping the grille will sag with time and cause those fingers to extend further downward.- The holes for installing the blue oval Ford emblem were drilled crooked.  I had to use a Dremel to elongate one hole in order for the emblem to be level.It sure looks nice.  If you have a few tools to make it fit, it's worth the purchase (and the cheapest one I've found.)  If you have minimal patience or minimal tools, I'd pass.

The fit of this item is absolutely perfect. It was installed on a 2003 Chevrolet 2500 4X4 truck. It came well packaged and all the items needed for installation are included. The instructions are a little misleading; they say to remove the front tow hooks and "return to the customer". The tow hooks can stay if you wish, otherwise you will have two large bolts and two lock washers left over. I decided to leave the tow hooks off since I will add a receiver shackle to replace the tow hooks on a central point. The finish is very nice, and I do believe it is powder coated. The only slightly difficult part of the installation is that a floor jack with a wood block would be required to hold up this heavy piece; I would HIGHLY recommend this versus trying to hold it up with one arm, or relying on a friend. If it falls on your face...emergency room for sure. Also, a carriage bolt needs to be installed in an existing frame hole (tow hook hole) which is about seven inches deep, facing down and through a provided square washer and the tow hitch. This is slightly daunting unless you use a magnet to position this carriage bolt. Overall, it fits well, and does not interfere with the lower part of the grill/air dam. I already had a Curt receiver plug, and no, it does not come with the hitch!

They work great. The projector shroud and back are plastic so not the most fine of materials but for the price what do you expect. The cutoff line on the low beams is very sharp, and the high beams on these is unbelievable. It's like someone turned the sun back on. I'm currently running them with 55w ballasts and 6000k h1 hid's. The whole adapter plate thing is a great idea but completely worthless. The projector is too long to fit inside a sealed beam using the adapters. I had to hollow out the back of my headlight to make them fit, that being said, it was a bit of work but worth it.

These look, feel and work just like the originals clips on my 2005 Honda Odyssey.  The clips holding the splash guard on the underside fall out and cause it to scrap on the road, forcing me to go to the dealer to replace them, so keeping these in the glove compartment saves me a lot of time!

So far so good.  Installed with perfect fit for my 2002 F250 superduty 7.3.  No leaks, OEM filter fit with no issues.  I have not pulled our trailer yet to test temps but expect this will make a big difference since the OEM pan was so shallow.  Sits just above the cross member for height and pretty heavy duty so not concerned for off road application.

As usual, K&N products are just great; fitted exactly on the 5/8" outlet on my valve cover. (Datsun A12 engine)  Just make sure the size on the outlet is the right one before ordering vent filters.Update:No, it did not came along any K&N sticker, saddly.

It's a filter. Can't go wrong with Purolator, particularly when you can get it cheaper here than at Autozone. Packed and arrived in perfect condition.

Exceeded my expectations, Very powerful! Easy to use and easy to install. I mounted the winch to my trailer, all the electronics are located in the  tool box above the winch. The winch control is also mounted to the side od the tool box.

I only gave it a 4 because of the size and the switch.It's not huge, but at 6", it's bigger than it really should be.Also, it'd be better if the switch were a three position one. That would allow the "utility" light to be used at any time. As it is, it gets its power from the +12V provided when the lights are on, not from the constant +12V at the plug.

Love the idea behind the sticker. I saw it and immediately looked online to buy my very own. I'd give it 5 stars but for some reason one of the corners won't stay down. I made sure to clean the area I applied it on (back window) and took care when applying. 5 minutes later I saw one of the corners coming up and every time I pressed down on it, it would just pop back up. Sadface.UPDATE: The seller read my review and got my problem taken care of quickly and quite generously. Great customer service!

Fits 06-09 Mega Cabs only. I installed mine in 20 minutes and left my windows up for a few days to make sure the adhesive strips hold. They look great and the cool air with no rain is a bonus.

This review is for the 5 in 1 gauge.Included with the gauge are the instructions.  Although other reviews indicate watch type batteries, the gauge I received requires 2 AAA batteries that are not included.With digital tire gauges in this price range (currently 13 dollars), I don't have high expectations, especially after trying a digital one a few months ago that was consistently 4 pounds off. This particular gauge is a multi-function type with some features a bit better than others.  For me personally, while it may be convenient to have a multi-use device, I normally prefer a tire gauge to be just that, mainly because it tends to function more reliably than multi-purpose devices.  This gauge has a flashlight on the end, a red LED light on the underside, a flip out window breaker and a seat belt cutter.  The gauge has a power switch that allows you to turn on the light of your choice, either the red Led or standard light, depending on which direction you push or turn the light off completely.  The lights work fine for finding the tire stem in the dark helping find a lost tire stem cap or something like that.  I am not sure of the additional benefit of the red led over the standard light but I guess it could help contrast something you drop in the dark.  The glass breaker has a switch that when pushed flips out the pointed metal hammer end.  Although this seems a bit lighter than the standard glass breaker and  I cant test this on glass, this does seem like it would work for breaking glass in an emergency situation.  The seat belt cutter is located in the slotted end of the handle, the blade in comparison to others I have used was surprisingly dull and I could not get it to cut paper or cardboard well and I doubt will cut a nylon seat belt.  Could it be I received one with a defective blade it is possible but I am not sure I would rely on this cutter prior to testing the blades sharpness.  For me, I am more concerned about how accurate this device is for air pressure.Turning on the gauge is accomplished by pushing the power button just below the display.  To change the measurement type on the gauge, just tap the power button to change either to PSI, BAR, KG/CM2 or KPA.  To turn off just hold the power button a few seconds.  When powered on a blue backlight for the display comes on for easier viewing.Having had a bad experience with a different brand of digital gauge, I tested this one on multiple tires on two different cars and use a reliable analog gauge to compare the results.  This gauge read consistent with my analog gauge within a half of a pound each time I tried it.  So I am satisfied that it is at least as accurate as any analog gauge I have.  Like most digital gauges in this price range there is no way to calibrate it, if the reading gets inaccurate.  The tip of the gauge is made of plastic and removable by unscrewing, I presume, for replacement if it breaks.  Although I don't really expect in this price range, I would prefer a metal tipped gauge.  The tire stem is also a bit short in some circumstance and I would prefer a longer pressure stem or one with a hose attached to make it easier to use.  The handle makes it easy to grip and is fairly comfortable otherwise to hang onto.  The body of the gauge like the tire pressure stem is plastic and well and most likely won't hold up to rough treatment or extreme conditions.  Because of that, this is more of a home or occasion use type of gauge.For a budget level gauge, this is fairly accurate in determining tire pressure.4 starsI was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.

This is hands down the best heavy duty steering I've installed on my LJ. Save yourself hundreds of dollars and get this kit vs. The currectlync or jks kits. This is solid, heavier, and thicker than the oem hollow light tie rod, and oem light drag link. The zerk tie rod end boots are okay, but hold up well, for the money saved you can order better boots and install them onto these...This order came shipped in protective sleeves, plastic caps to protect tie rod ends, and grade 8 hardware. I also enjoy the adjusting sleeve found on the tie rod, as the stock tie rod did not have one, and doing an alignment used to scratch the oem tie rod up- no more with the easily adjustable sleeve. I am currently rolling on 35's with this crown steering kit.

If you are looking at an easy upgrade for the cosmetics to seperate your rig from many others in the same parking lot, then this is the item for you.  The install is up front and simple.  The outcome looks bold and burly with function. Product arrived in prestige condition and unlike many other items now a days, the holes actually lined up directly.  The tools required are a philips medium head and a needle nose pliers to assist in holding the spacers.  There are two different lengths of screws for each side due to fixture thickness as the body curves which constitutes why there are two different screw sets.

This is a great product Im happy I found it on the Internet it will help carry the load on the rear bumper of the RV. I would recommend this to anybody that has a rack on the rear of their RV to use these they give you a lot more support and comfort knowing that they're back there.  They are very easy to install I had him on within 45 minutes after delivery

I just installed the Moog parts on my '99 4Runner and they appear better made than the OEM parts. The inner joint is IDENTICAL in construction to the OEM installed part. Its made in Japan so I suspect the part is purchased from the same manufacturer that made my OEM part.The outer rods are slightly different but the boots on the new joints are bigger and there is a zirc lube nipple my OEM part did not have. These parts also were labeled MADE IN JAPAN. See the pics. New on top.

FINALLY replaced the stock front shocks on our 2005 Hemi Durango. The new Bilsteins are a beefier shock and fit perfect. To install you will need to also unbolt the anti-sway bar on each side to get the lower shock bolts out which is not a big deal. Having now driven on them for a couple weeks I feel they are a great improvement over the OEM shocks. The largest improvement was noticed on dirt and bumpy roads. Handles amazingly smooth over rougher surfaces. I couldn't believe the difference. Replacing the OEM shocks will also help to nearly eliminate the jarring side to side motion these Durangos do when going over speed bumps and such. A worthy upgrade I wish I had done a few years ago.

I bought this vinyl to add some color to my car's interior.  When the roll first arrived, it appeared brighter than I thought it would be.  I paid someone to do the wrapping, and I was pleased with the results.EDIT: I have added some photos of the trim while the car is in the garage.  It is a much more vibrant blue when in direct sunlight.

This was pretty easy to install on my 2006 Lexus RX400h.  Needed my son to hold up one end while I put in the bolts.  Although I am sure it works as designed, it looks REALLY ugly on my nice Lexus.  None of it is hidden and the huge piece that goes below the muffler sticks out like a purple dinosaur.  I wish I had spent the extra money on the hidden hitch.

This is a very solidly built D-ring hitch.  Fit in my 2014 ram 1500 2" hitch just fine.  Has a nice thick gloss black finish too it.  Was a bit concerned with the hole being drilled close to the end.  Potentially causing it to stick out further than i wanted.  Was worried for nothing as it fit just fine.  The hitch is completely solid.  no hollow metal here.  My only complaint, and minor at that,  would be another hole to change the orientation of the D-ring.  Haven't had the chance to use it yet,  but the thing is built like a tank,  and I have no concerns that it won't do its job.

I bought these for an 04 F150 (5.4L 3V Triton) I'm trying to recondition for my son, who is about to get his license. They arrived on time (Prime 2 day), in original Motorcraft packaging (see pic) and in good condition.I ordered these because I had the dreaded knock/tap/click that many who own 5.4 3V F150s are all too familiar with. The truck sounded like a diesel at drive-thru windows, lacked power between 40 - 60 mph, vibrated like the drivetrain was about to drop on the highway, had a slight miss @ idle (not enough to throw a code, of course), and generally ran like garbage. The local dealer told me I "probably needed a new engine" and after hours of research, I was worried that I might have a bad lifter, I might need phasers, all new timing components or that the pesky dealer might be right about needing an entirely new engine. These COPs were the last attempt to salvage the truck before it went up for sale as a "mechanic's special".I'm happy to say that wasn't necessary...at least not yet! I put these on after work 2 nights ago, being sure to disconnect the battery beforehand and complete the throttle relearn procedure afterwards, and poof, she's running like a scalded dog again and as quiet as a church mouse. Throttle response is great, the miss & vibration are gone and I don't feel like Fred Sanford in the drive-thru anymore!Now, I've only put about 50 miles on them so far, so I suppose some of the improvement could be the result of the throttle relearn procedure, but I've run that same procedure when replacing the throttle body itself a few months back, when doing other engine or electrical work, etc., and it never ran this well or this quietly after any of those scenarios.We'll be taking the truck to the Outer Banks for my son's first attempt at beach driving in a few weeks, so the highway miles getting there and the off-road workout once we're there should tell me whether these improvements are permanent or not. If I notice any noteworthy changes, I'll update the review after we return. For now though, I couldn't be happier.One last thing, and this is coming from experience. Don't waste your money on cheap Chinese knock offs that offer a full set of 8 for the price of 1 or 2 of these. That will only help for a few weeks (if you're lucky). Buy these. They're engineered for your truck and will save you time, money and more headaches in the long run.

I bought these thinking I'd save a little bit. Nope. Garbage. Had for ~2000 miles and ran over a small pothole. Nothing out of the ordinary... Then the clunking started. I had been riding with these broken for 500 miles and the clunking was absolutley INSANE. These are not high-quality parts. Save yourself the trouble, and buy OEM quality parts. I inspected my shock mounts, and this is what I found. The plastic bushing on the inside was COMPLETELY separated from the metal housing. I will not be buying URO parts again. I have some of their other parts in my car, and now I'm scared that they're going to go bad on me too!!I want my money back.See attached pictures of the damage.

First off, I'll start by saying that these are undoubtedly the brightest T10 LED bulbs on the market. I've tried about 9 or 10 different brands and nothing comes even close to these in regards to the lumens produced. Now let's talk about the build quality. Originally, Alla Lighting had these bulbs with thinner connectors (refer to the picture, the bulb on the left) that would constantly break off due to poor soldering. Then Alla introduced the "New" version with thicker connectors (refer to the picture) that were supposed to eliminate the breaking off problem, however, as you can see for yourself, it did not work. Overall, I have spent a couple of hundred dollars due to constantly having to replace the failed bulbs. Eventually, I had to switch to a different brand, one with a different connector design (picture on the right), which will never break off, but had to sacrifice on the brightness. I will not purchase anymore of the Alla Lighting T10 bulbs until the connection design is completely changed.

The dealer has hot-stamped their name and logo across the reflector. What a shame.If you mount the tape vertically the name will be vertical. If you cut the strips the logo will get cut in half.It was completely unnecessary for them to destroy the product by branding it across the reflective side.

First off, the cabin filter I received does not look like the picture, so I am basing my review on what I received, assuming it was correct. The filter is what you should expect from a cabin filter. Nothing special really, but I like the idea this being carbon activated. I would have given this a 5 star, but since what I received did not actually fit even though it was supposed to, I had to consider this as part of the rating. Luckily though, on the item I received there is a fairly large plastic part which I was able to cut off quite easily with a wire cutter and that made the filter fit. The instructions did not mention anything about cutting to "adjust" the size, so I have to assume the part checker was just incorrect or the part I received was incorrect.Regardless, in the end I was able to get it to fit it after cutting the plastic end part off.

It fits my F-134 Jeep engine.I went to an electric fuel pump and a Weber 2 barrel on my 65 CJ5 so the dead mechanical pump was taking up space. Initially I was going to make a blank flange but I saw this one listed.It was cleaned up some more after the photo was taken.

I ordered these for my Honda Pioneer 500.  They will require modification. When you put them on stock they slip because the Honda roll bar is smaller even when tight.  Do not use the gasket it came with. What I did was I used a piece of rubber hose and cut it the length and size of this gasket. The hose will be double in size of the thickness of the gasket. Then installed the mirrors. They are really tight and don't move. Be sure to tighten down all the screws under the mirror once you align everything.  The black rubber hose I bought at home depot was $5.00.  I don think they will have any issue on the trail if you were to hit something they would move in since they are break away mirrors.

I bought a portable air compressor recently and picked up a set of these tire deflators to use with my vehicles I take off road. I have never owned or used these style of deflator before. They include 4 deflator valves, a storage pouch, directions, extra set of springs (with a different psi range) and a sticker. The deflators are well made and are a very nice quality product. I feel the full retail price is too expensive for these (even though they are made in the USA which is a big plus) but was fortunate to find a nicely discounted returned "Warehouse Buy" set. They come factory set at 15psi. I reset mine to two separate higher psi settings - a pair for the front and a different psi setting for the rear pair. It took some time to get them dialed in but once set they are accurate and after a few uses and checking them with a good qualtiy tire gauge they have always been within a pound or two of what I set them at. It is amazing how easy these make airing down. Definitely one of the best options to go with if you hit the trails often and want to save time and your back. My truck weighs around 8000lbs and has 10ply E-Load tires so they are aired up to 65psi fronts/ 60psi rears most of the time when not hauling / towing. It takes a little over 2 minutes to air down the fronts (to 40psi) and about 3 minutes for the rears (to 35psi).  The heavy diesel engine seems to help make the front tires air down faster. Very happy with this product.

I've used these clamps for years when replacing exhaust pipes on various vehicles. I've used this brand specifically numerous times as well and never had a problem. Mine came with both nuts and tightened down without stripping while properly crimping the pipes together. They did not "flatten" out or anything unusual as some others have reported. I really prefer these types of clamps when connecting exhaust because they often seal the best (believe it or not) if done up correctly. I've had leak issues with band clamps in addition to the fact that I've had pipes, mainly tail pipes, rotate while in a band clamp. That can't occur with these saddle-type clamps as they deform the two pipes into each other. Even if the clamp comes loose, falls off or rusts away the two pipes it crimped together will still stay together and not leak. Heck, you could likely use the clamp to crimp your pipes together and then remove the clamp altogether and it'd likely be fine. The only downside is removing the pipes at a later date if need be, these will be very difficult to get the pipes removed in the future if need be.As you can see in the image of my last exhaust joint, the clamp did everything it was supposed to.

Tried lots of products. Found the winner.  Wax on Wax Off Danielson.  It leaves a velvet soft finish. The Iridium color on my new truck pops. This even works on plastics. The windows all leaving a shine they can see on a satellite.I have not and will not be trying on gritty surface. But a quick hose down and spray on wipe dry BOOM awesome. Add a lillte more bling. Use anouther dry micro fiber towel and it gets even more glossy.

For the average person, who is not necessarily going to maintain these filters (cleaning, oiling), I don't think it's worth the risk of allowing dust to pass thru. I removed a conical filter RU-4960 from a car with a cold-air intake (filter outside left front wheelwell).  It had gone through several owners, who had no idea that K&N filters are not waterproof and require maintenance. The filter was badly neglected. Nor did it have the outer protection sleeve ('drycharger'). For all I know, it was NEVER maintained since 2008 or possibly earlier. Unfortunately, it let a lot of dust through as you can see in the photos.A a stock paper filter will protect the engine from this very fine dust. I would be interested in knowing if this dust did any damage to the engine. What  is done is done. K&N website does discuss these type of concerns and defends its filters. I believe they are ok assuming they are maintained, which is a BIG assumption. For me, it's just NOT worth the risk. For performance enthusiasts, it may be fine.  But don't ditch your factory system.

LIKE this tool, hate the gauge! Having a 160Lb scale on an air gauge is like having a 12 Grand tach on a Buick. The area of readability you need occurs in about 3/4" on this thing. Your 30-pound tire barely moves the needle! OTHERWISE: I think this is a bitchin' setup. I replaced the air gauge with a 12-dollar unit found right here on Amazon- the "PIC Gauge 101D-208D", which works awesome and has a 0-to-60Lb scale. This means that "30 pounds" is straight-up on the dial... very nice for filling car tires. I did have to tap both the gauge and the inflator to 3/8"x24 threads, which wasn't too tough.  After reading other's complaints about the air chuck sealing, I installed the new gauge and immediately filled the tires on my 71 Demon, '69 GTX. Honda Mini-Trail, and my bicycle... all without any issues at all. You clip it on, IT SEALS... no air hissing or any other drama. I do wish the air hose was another 12" longer though.

Great, sturdy product and look great too! I wanted to give. Side by side comparison of the grips that come with the Jeep and the Opar Black handles.  You can see that the Opar are made of better material with a support patch that goes on top of the roll bar for better support.I also provided picture of the original grips on the installed and the Opar handles installed also. Just looking at them on the roll bar you can tell they are sturdy. My the Velcro won't allow the grips to slip, twist or turn.They are very well made and a great product. One down side to them is they do hang down a bit. Not further then the original grins but it would be helpful if they did not have done quite as far. That did not change my review they are still a 5 star. I would definitely recommend this product!

I used this to replace all three of the U-Joints on my 2004 1500 Silverado. The tool is absolutely invaluable and worth every penny. It pays for itself with the first bearing cap....it really does.The easiest way to use this is to clamp the C-channel in a vise. I had to use PB Blaster to get the old joints pressed off, but the tool worked great!  New ones pressed on with ease.

This oil pan heater is absolutely amazing I put this on my 2000 Chevy Lumina on a 3 hour timer and my car starts easier, warms up faster and saves me a lot of wear and tear on my engine in the cold winter months.  Heater comes with an adhesive side.  But I recommend that you use a high temp silicone to seal it to your oil pan to prevent any water from getting between it and the oil pan also put some on the Sticky Side to give better thermal conductivity for heat transfer.

These save me so much time!!I used to HATE applying tire gel to my tired with a pad that was constantly getting weaker and weaker, and making my hands dirty in the process.This product is very firm foam, and will not fall apart. I drizzled a small bit of Meguiar's endurance tire gel on this, and spread it on a nice clean tire. It went on SO easy, and only took a few seconds!! It was very easy to use, and feels of high quality. This turned my 10-minute tire job, into a 1 minute job. This works easily for large, and small tires. I usually use them on my sedan, and I am able to do all my tires in a very timely manner.I would absolutely recommend these!EDIT: I've included pictures of a worn-out pad, after doing probably 25 sets of tires (100 tires total), using Meguiars Endurance Tire Gel. Take a look at the pads to see how they wear.EDIT 9/14/2017 : I don't know if these have been changed, but the price is twice what they used to be. These only last 5-6 cars now, and gunk up and look awful after only a few uses. I've switched to another brand in hopes for better durability . At this price point ($10-12), these are no longer worth the buy, and I am upset at the quality now.

Unit measured 30.58mm, well within tolerances for a 31.0mm nominal length.  The other person who complained it was closer to 36mm must have received a misassembled device or the wrong part altogether.Current consumption measured at 60mA @ 12.0VDC, yielding 0.72W -- close to the advertised 0.9W.  For comparison, the incandescent lamp I removed consumes 560mA for 6.7W.  If you're prone to leave your dome lights on, this swap would make a big difference in time before your battery is drained.And, as expected, this "bulb" is much brighter and whiter than the standard filament type bulb.Be careful, though, as the width made it a tight fit in my application as it is definitely wider than the filament type bulb.  These fit fine in a 2007 Toyota FJ Cruiser.

I bought this to go with the Warn 29071 manual hub conversion kit. The lock washer is of poor design and quality.  The index tab that locks it into place is too short.  When I went to torque the outer ring, the tab slipped out and started to rotate along with the inner ring, putting too much torque on the bearing.  All it needs is a slight re-design to make the tab longer.  There is plenty of room for a longer tab.  Oddly this happened on one side only.

Installed on my 2011 Enclave and fit perfect. But, the plastic bumper cover on mine did not fit after. I cut and smoothed a hole that looks pretty good and Im happy with the results. Wish it fit without cutting like the newer models apparently do. The biggest problem was the existing tapped holes in the frame. After only five years they were so rusted and corroded (Michigan winters) I had a really hard time cleaning them up so I could start the bolts with my fingers a couple turns to get the hitch hung in place while on my back. Wish Buick would cover or protect the holes somehow to prevent this. Also had to really wrench the bolts due to the rusted holes. Recommend a long 18mm wrench. The two bolts in the middle back were easy. I tapped the nut ends to the steel  block washers to keep in place while installing bolts. A little S bend in the nut handle was easy to work out to hold in place. Also was a lot easier getting muffler hangers back on than removing. It took me a couple hours total including cutting the bumper cover hole. If you have rusted holes a metric tap (size ?) would be a big help to clean the holes.

Used this on my Jeep wrangler. One can was enough. Got most of everything that had surface rust. Dried fully in about 24 hours (~50 degree garage, low humidity). Use cheap 2" brushes and plan to throw them out. Use some plastic wrap on can before closing lid if trying to save it. It gets on everything and is hard to get off. It stinks horribly so suggest using a respirator. Only been on a week so no long term report.

After reading many reviews and seeing the comparison pictures.. I had doubts, but I hoped these bulbs would be at least a little whiter looking than my yellow stock headlights on my motorcycle.When I fired them up.. I couldn't believe my eyes. Exactly the same as stock.How can these be advertised as 4000K?I see almost no change from the cheap stock headlights.I understand you really need HID xenons to get the real look, but I had hopes these would look somewhat similar. Not the case.I can at least hope these are very reliable.I would not purchase these again.

The cover in question, while works, has some draw backs in my opinion.First, the vinyl cover is not very thick, so I foresee me buying another cover in two years.Second, the latch system to attach the cover to the bed is fair at best.  The rear latches are more or less fine, other than side to side adjustment (that made this cover fit too many applications).  However the front latches need to be spring loaded clasps, not this flimsy plastic clip on a bolt.  They move all over the place, and if you "lock" them in place to fold up the cover they fall down wanting the puncture the cover, poor design.Third, I hope once it gets warmed in the sun and "settles" on my truck is seals better.  Currently there are gaps regardless the adjustment I do front to rear and side to side.That all said about the cover, the package was nice and neat.  The instruction were clear.  The strips of foam for the tailgate are very plush (however pointless since the bed cover doesn't really fit).  Overall I am disappoint and if it wasn't such a hassle to mail something this big back, I would return it.

Love how there's 2 secure straps (one on top and one on bottom) to secure the organizer in place to the back seat. Other car organizer I owned in the past only secures on the headrest which causes the organizer to sway back and forth a lot during bumpy rides especially at speed bumps which causes mild complaints for the back passengers.Great organization for small items, trinkets and bottles. The bottle water organizer has a lot of uses for quick access, I personally use it for my mini umbrella. The see through slot replaces my LCD Car Mobile DVD player as I just bring my old ipad now instead for passengers to view during long car rides (just make sure to bring the ipad with you when you leave your car in public since it may attract thieves). The bottom organizer is okay, but wished it was combined internally with the one on top and was replaced with a tissue box holder.There's a mesh lining  throughout making it look like a premium product with a lot of protection. All compartments are sturdy and well built and don't see them wearing or tearing any time soon.Overall very impressed with this product and have received great complements from back seat passengers.I received this product at a discount in exchange for a honest review

This ladder seemed awesome. Right up until I went to mount  it. Now my rig has 4 new holes. One of which tore all the way through. The other 3 felt ready to pull through also. I wanted this to work, but it just destroyed the possibility of a drilled in ladder option. The ladder was ok, the mounting system is horrible however.

The receiver drier does not fit my 2000 Safari van even though this product combination kit (compressor and drier) says it fits - connections don't line up.  This is a significant problem as the drier should be replaced when the compressor is changed - my new compressor is already making noise after only 2 weeks in.  Oboe have to order the correct drier and hope I can correct the problem.

If you set your expectations appropriately, this is a good product. It's not going to flawlessly cover paint scratches, but it will make things look a little less obvious. I have a really cheap paint job on my 64 Corvair, red over the factory white. Look at it crossways and it scratches. Here are a couple of photos of the results. It's not going to fool anyone, but it's not as glaring as a white streak sticking through.

It was a little difficult to fit perfectly back in place and it kept pushing antenna female end back deeper into truck as i pushed part into place and couldn't get threads started. Eventually i pushed my antenna rod thru the plastic and screwed antenna directly to threads and pushed plastic into place.

Useless crap isn't measured correctly, made of the thinnest and cheapest vinyl, and even featured an extra cut along one edge so the back one ripped when I tried to line it up. Of course I wasn't in a rush, so now it's too late to return the junk.

This stuff is great. Makes the waxing process enjoyable. My paint is 15 years old. Well it was! Lol. Update: Yeah this is the wax spray wax that I always keep coming back to stray off and try to use other stuff but I always come back to the stuff it's the best.  I started buying the gallons recently so I can just go nuts and sprayed on everything with the painted surface that is. like other reviewer's it does cloud up a little bit shoot some water on your car clean car wipe it down again. That's when you get the true shine.

overall I like the lights but there are some issues that I would like to see corrected.  First, the product shipped without directions.  Ok I know how to hook up lights but I was not sure how many amps the lights draw making it difficult to know what sized wires I needed and what type of relay to use.  I would also like to change the light over to a black ring but I have no way of knowing how to contact the manufacturer.  I guess I could have returned the lights but that would be a hassle.  lights have a black frame in most of the images but mine has a silver frame.  Not the biggest deal but still.  The lights I got have a very cheap looking "LED" sticker that does not even fit the light.  This one detail makes the light look cheap.  (see attached image)Will the lights work?  Yes and they seem like they are as bright as they claim but there is room for improvement.

I bought this for a Chevy Avalanche which is essentially a double cab short bed. It does not even come close to fitting it. The rear cab/bed treatments were too much for the cab area in the cover. Length-wise it was a perfect fit. i was able to sung the gathered ends fully over both bumpers, front and rear. I had to bungee the sides down with the grommets in the cover. It only covered about the top 3/4 of the doors due to the cab shape not fitting. Had it not been for that, it could have been a great cover.If you have an antenna that is not retractable, they include instructions on how to cut your cover custom. And they include a nice little donut shaped patch to keep it from tearing after you customize it for your antenna.

Installed it in 90 degree weather. Bought the black 80mil noico so it matches the carpet. It's thinner than Dynamat and once it has a rip it peels like lead foil. It's very tacky and gets everywhere so wear ragged clothes and gloves. Make sure you buy some type of rolling tool, I didn't and had to use a rollerblade to smooth it out. 36sq feet wasn't enough to do my whole trunk but I believe if I was experienced and had a proper roller it probably could have been enough.

I received these bags as a gift and I'm very pleased with them.  Heavy duty, rigid leather, look like factory equipment on my Honda Shadow Aero.  No hassle installation.  They fit very snug and tight to the bag frames, and secure with cable ties so no flapping in the wind.  The medium size offers plenty room for day or weekend trips.  Not weather-tight, but will be weather resistant I'm sure.  I don't plan on riding in the rain anyway.  They can be locked with tiny luggage padlocks (not included.)

These lights are very nice and are a good size as well. The only downfall is the installation on them. What I am saying is that the screws provided are not log enough and I assume it was a little difficult to put on because of the bumper guard I have on. Either way, make sure you have an extended wrench piece and at least 1hour to install it all. I really like how they turned out and I love the look that adds to my truck.

(UPDATE. February 2017. The plastic in which the LEDs are sealed is becoming cloudy. Not sure why.) I am using them as turn signals on a UTV in conjunction with a kit from ledtsk.com. I mounted them fairly high on the roll cage using the included double stick tape - clean, low profile install. They are very bright - brighter than most car blinkers - and they can be seen from a 90 degree angle. My only complaint is the two tiny wires sealed inside a single sheath; very tedious to work with for a mere civilian such as myself.

The bulbs are great if they both worked.  Only one of the 2 bulbs works .... for 20$ I expected both to be working no problem!UpdateOrdered 2 more bulbs and again one didn't work . From the 2 that worked one only liked to turn on when it was not in the housing ( see pics ... when i put it back in the housing the right bulb refused to turn on)  so I had to change them (left to right - right to left) to work.The bulbs look good yes but due to the hassle these caused I will not be ordering these again .

I've always been a fan of FRAM filters (for a previous Honda Accord I had for 10+ years). I now have a 2001 BMW 330i which just uses this paper filter insert in a filter housing that does not get replaced. I run high quality full synthetic and do around 8k changes, and use the MANN 925/4X filter. I was out and bought this locally, as no one had the MANN in stock.Why the 1 star review?The filter delaminated from itself and was not filtering my oil AT ALL. VERY scary, and I am very much so hoping that I don't have permanant, long term engine damage or accelerated wear from this issue. So much for 3x life.Today, I went to change my oil. I remove the FRAM filter, and say: wait a second, this only has the plastic cap on one end of the filter. I look in the filter housing cap, and sure enough, there is the cap. I look at the paper filter and discover that it has half separated from the other end cap. Then it dawns on me that this had been going on for how long? Who knows. No oil filtering has been occurring at all I believe, unless it was compressed enough to not let oil flow through the ends (very much so hoping this is the case). Holy wow, not cool. I am extremely disappointed and will not trust a FRAM filter again. Maybe this is happening inside their sealed filters as well, and you just wouldn't know it

I had the chance to install this last weekend and really resolved the cyclic growling. The cyclic growling started after I installed a Bilstein 5100 front shocks and leveled it to 2.5inches height. They said the 2.5 inches level should not affect the pinion angle much and should no worry about it but right after I installed the shocks and 2.5" level, the cyclic growl started at decceleration. I can still hear it even if the radio is on and people noticed. When I measured the angles, there is 3 degrees difference between. Now all I can hear is the humming sound of my 35inch mud tires.It was a pain to remove the two leaf spring center pin bolts where these will be wedged in because they rotate along with the wrench. After a bit of thinking, I used a small pipe wrench and ram the teeth of the wrench in the center pin bolt heads and use a pipe as a leverage. This prevents the bolts to rotate and was able to remove and tighten the center pin bolts. You have to do some trial and error until you succesfully ram the head on the spot.Let's see how these will hold up. Overall worked as advertized.

Much cheaper on amazon then elsewhere.  It's a bit tough to install by yourself on jackstands but I did it within 4 hours.  You have to cut the underbody panel and heat sheild but it doesnt require drilling.  I used the install video from etrailer to help install this. Seems good quality and heavy duty.  Used it with a cargo rack so far.  Barely noticeable by itself on the Pacifica.

I bought this kit with hopes to make bubble flares the right way (vs winging it with a double flare tool)Total Junk. Which is sad because when I opened it everything seemed nicely made and well laid out.The second bubble flare broke the tiny pin that holds the wingnut down. Ok... no big deal. I bought a grade 8 bolt and just clamped it with a nut and two washers.The third attempt broke the center of the 4.75mm arbor in the brake line!I have requested a return today and will look at other tool options. You get what you pay for.

Put a bottle of this in,  topped off the coolant per instructions, and took a good long drive (about 50 miles). Voila - not one drip of coolant leaked while parked overnight. For a bad gasket, I give this 5 stars. It's cheap and easy.

I used the bag for a day trip. There's plenty of space in the bag to store a few items. The velcro straps seem to do job all alone but I used a few other straps that came with the bag and they added more security. I think it's great bag, I would definitely recommend the bag to any friend that needs one. The bag can definitely be used for an overnight trip.

Spins up great with little/no vibration and engages well with my clutch.

This is a 22"L x 13"W x 9.5"H trunk storage. Unlike my old trunk storage box I picked up at Costco this storage box has rigid sides, so the sides don't flop over when the storage box is not full. It folds up as an accordion when needed into a 13" x 11" bundle. The main compartment is divided into two sections, separated by a hard divider. It has mesh pockets on the outside as well as one large canvas pocket one one of the narrow sides.  The other side has a reflective triangle (attention road sign) which can be used in an emergency. The storage has no cover.The storage box has handles on the sides so it is easy to  move it around. It also has grommets on the narrow sides (2 on each side) so it has an option of being tied to something.This cargo trunk arrived with slight damage. Normally it has two clips on two sides so it can be kept compact and tidy when folded up.  One of my clips was broken, so it can be clipped only on one side.  I cut off the broken clip as it had sharp edges.  I typically keep the storage open and full so the broken clip is not a big deal for me. If needed I can sew on a replacement clip of my own.This cargo trunk is provided for evaluation and testing as part of the new product introductions on Amazon.  I like it  much better then the old floppy sided storage!Ali Julia review

Back in February of this year, 2017, my son bought this air horn, https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YWLAOU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 A couple of weeks ago it stopped working, after some 'detective' work we discovered one of the two on demand air pumps had died. I ordered this air motor so he could replace the bad one, it has only been installed a couple of days but he is happy that the air horns are working again.In the picture, the bigger motor is the original one and the smaller is the new one, this one.

Stud broke the first time I put a wheel on.  These pictures weren't good enough for a refund or a replacement.  Customer service will give you the run around.  My fault for trying to go cheap.  Very upset with this purchase.

These are a direct replacement for the switches used in most RV and utility trailers (Snowmobile, Car Haulers...).  I broke two of these when I was finishing my walls, not a switch issue (wall depth was 1" and I bent the terminals over to get them to fit flush...needless to say I purchased some JR Products 13605 to fix this issue (its a wall plate designed to allow more space for thin wall applications).

I was putting JK Rubicon shock on front of my XJ and realized the bar pin wasn't gonna come out of my old shocks.. This kit, though slightly over priced, was a life saver and possably gave me an extra inch of shock travel in the process...

Bought this for the AMBER FOG LIGHTS! AMBER ONLY FLASHES!!! Just installed and now deciding whether to uninstall and Hassel with sending back. Add said it has amber fog lights. Gonna up from 2-3 stars do to quality of light seems well made and bright. Easy install on 08 f150. Hoping someone lets us know how to make amber burn solid. I ordered $20 in Amber covers for now. Would look real good as Amber fog/running lights on my Harley edition Ford. AMBER ONLY FLASHES!!!

This thing is amazing and the quality is first rate. The price I paid was so cheap I was afraid to buy it as it just seemed way too low. It came double boxed and both boxes were pristine. The hitch was very easy to install and now all I need to do is use it. I know it will work fantastic though just by its design and quality of materials. The hitch say's 600 lbs but the bars say 800/8,000 lbs so this thing is a beast. I guess its 600 lb 6000 pounds with out the bars perhaps? Not quite sure. The ball and shank are extremely heavy like close to 80 lbs or so which is kind of a bummer but it is what it is and that is one great hitch. I couldn't imagine buying any other hitch especially for the price I paid for this one. Buy with confidence.Update: I towed my travel trailer on a long  230 miles one way 460 miles round trip with the hitch in very windy conditions and it performed flawlessly. This hitch is quiet, stops all sway and is the bomb. I highly recommend it. This is my third travel trailer and third hitch and its by far the best one of them all. Don't buy anything else because for the money this is the one!

Receive my Subaru crossbar kit for the 2018 Subaru Crosstrek. Happy with the quality of them. The clamps that attach to side rails have padding on them to protect from scratching. Crossbars do attract in and out for different length to side rails of the vehicle. Tools required came in Packaging torx head screwdriver T30. Take no longer than 10 minutes to sit on the car and tighten the four  screws at the top of each crossbar. Instructions are easy to follow. Just make note of specifics on the facing of each crossbar. Check the torque 30 to 35 inch pounds of torque to each screw. Overall happy with how easy the insulation is.

Bought this 10pack to replace interior and exterior 194/168 Incandescent bulbs for my 2003 Maxima. I replaced the plate lights and side marker bulbs, door splash lights, front and rear clearance lights you can see in my pictures what they look like. Oem plate bulb compared to ASTAR, the absurdly bright light cast in the door lamp, and then how they look in the headlight as well as the amber side marker. I'm hoping these last because they look absolutely awesome!!

2504 fits snug with the rubber ring that comes with it, just plug and play into the right slots with a lil bit of force you'll hear them click into place. I had to replace my old 2 year old Nokya 7k that burnt out. You can see in the picture the right fog light is the led bulb, left is still the after market Nokya way brighter than stock still has a yellow to them, LED is way to go instead. I will report back on how long they last. The pair I got all worked, thankfully not defective. Good luck!

They reduce the light output which reduces how much you can see out on the road/trial. The color is what is described and helps somewhat in dusty conditions. They clamp on and off easily so its not much of a hassle. I think there overpriced since there selling them separately but where else are you going to find them for less.  They do look bad ass but at a cost of light output.

I used these on my Fiat 500X reverse lights. They fit perfect and are super bright! No problems at all with the install and I would buy them again. The color looks more like 5000K.Edit: was forced to add a 20K bleed resistor as they would glow when off.

This was one on the beat ideas I have seen next to the wire tie.  Great materal, great design, adjustable, and my girl liked it for the 30 min it worked untill the threads ripped apart. And every thing fell apart. That would be my only compliant.  And she's only a buck ten.  I was just going to work with the seller to get my money back or ask if they can trippelestitch it with a better thread. If they can and fix that one small flaw.  All the boys are buying this one, and at the end of the day, for 70 bucks, it's worth it, if ya have a shorty on the back of a quad.  We will see I guess. In business it's not about the action plan or the 1st mistake, it's about the recovery plan and customer retention.  I'm sure they will review and recover.

These are pretty good and the look is starting to grow on me.  I do not quite understand why they would give you a massive amount of large hardware to choose a color then make you use silver for the side markers though.  I ended up using the black ones on the lenses and buying some longer bolts from home depot for the nylocks.  The side markers do not come with light housings, you are supposed to use your OEM light housings in the lens.  The fit is ok, not the worst I have seen but good for the price of these.  I had hoped the coverage would be a little more but the bolts will allow me to rig up a temporary solution for inspection time that should just bolt on and off.It was hard for me to gauge the coverage because years ago I cut my factory fenders for clearance reasons.  When doing so I had tossed my old bulb housings figuring I would never need them.  I found that after shaving down some generic ford bulb housings purchased at a local auto parts store they fit into the lenses fine with a bit of trial and error.Install is pretty easy and straight forward with some basic tools, a drill bit, and some touch up paint. I ended up using some spray paint and some cardboard with a small hole in it to avoid over spray.I Included some coverage shots, I have 35x12.5x15 MTR's on 4.5" of backspacing (-19mm offset).  Photo's aren't the best but will give you some idea of the coverage.

if you want a PRO look to your install get these additional supplies BEFORE you start:  AA battery operated solder unit, solder, black 3M electrical tape, couple of extra 10mm buts and bolts, 5meters of 16 gauge spare wire black and  white, terminal connectors, strong pliers, anti-rust compound AND sand paper.I was working on an old trailer that was rusted and falling apart.  Needed to sand the metal where the bolts go as these function as the grounds for for the lights.  Soldered all connections except where a terminal connector was used to connect kit ground and also needed to drill a 10mm hole on door to trailer chassis to run a wire and established a strong ground.This kit is incredibly well thought-out.  Only problem was that the wires run short and i barely had enough wire for the GREEN (passenger) tail-light.  Dimensions of my trailer are 11 ft 8 IN by 7 ft.

Easy is a relative term, I did this with 2 jacks, 2 jack-stands, wrenches and an air impact the very few times I was able other than removing the wheels. If I had a lift, a good breaker bar, a quick lift floor jack and some ratcheting box end wrenches (in an air conditioned bay), this would have been a breeze.I didn't, I had an 8 ton bottle jack, the stock scissor jack, chunks of plywood, vice grips/pliers, and 2 x 18mm sockets...In the perfect condition I described it probably would have taken me about an hour, in the conditions of my austere Alabama driveway in August it took me all afternoon. It's not a difficult process, just think about how you're going to raise the vehicle and manipulate the front suspension independently.A good plan and layout of your tools ahead of time will save you a lot of hassle, watch some youtube, succeed!

These are noticeably brighter and whiter than stock.  I had a bit of trouble getting them in so I trimmed just a hair off the bulb end of the positioning tabs.Picture shows stock bulb on the passenger side, LED bulb on the driver side.  The picture doesn't really show how much brighter and whiter the LED is.I just put them in so 5 stars for now.  If they have any problems I'll revise the review.

I have a pair of these stands bought about a year ago and have put them to very good use.  These stands are light weight and very sturdy.  Got a second pair to add to my collection for tire rotation.  I'm planning to use a pair on each side when I'm working under the front of the vehicle to access the O2 sensors.

I had to retract my previous review because after 3 months of having thus installed I love this product. You're getting a sturdy product at such a low price. It definetely holds up as I am a big buy and I feel the strength of this nerf bar holding. Shipping was fast and installation was a breeze. Only thing I have to complain about was the holes inside the bars themselves weren't threaded properly so when I used my impact drill to bolt on, metal shavings came out. BUT DON'T WORRY your not stripping the threads your just opening them up really. I know this because I repeatedly uninstalled to make sure I wasn't damaging anything. It jus made it easier to bolt back on and there was no wiggle just straight secure and tight bolts.

I installed these on a 2015 Toyota Sienna LE without issue in just a few minutes.  There was plenty of clearance behind the headlight housings for these LED bulbs.  They're crisp and bright.Note that the 2015 Toyota Sienna LE does NOT have daytime running lights (DRL).  I don't know if other models that have DRL use the same bulb or the high-beam bulb.  I replaced only the low-beam bulbs.PROS:- Relatively easy to install- Bright, crisp light (looks like high-quality HID lights)- Fans are quiet (you can hear them if your engine is off and you're listening for them; otherwise, you won't hear them)- Price is good for LED lightsCONS:- The LED controller gets relatively hot (133F); I'm concerned they might burn out- Finding a way to mount and secure the LED controller can be a bit challenging- Spinning motors introduce yet another potential failure pointInstalling the LED bulb itself was extremely easy -- just twist the bulb into the headlight housing (H11 mount) and attach the power connector to the LED light.  It took only about 1 minute per bulb.  However, this LED light has some sort of LED/fan controller box that sits inline with the power cable (others have posted photos of this).  Trying to figure out where to mount that controller was a bit of a challenge.  I didn't want to leave it dangling, as it would rattle up against other parts in the engine compartment and it would eventually cause fatigue on the power cable and break.  Also, the controller gets a bit hot, so I didn't want to mount it to anything plastic.  I found a part of the car's frame above the light that I zip-tied the controllers to.The LED lights make a huge difference in the crispness and brightness of the headlights.  I was pleasantly surprised that it looked like high-quality HID lights and not some cheap aftermarket light.  I've posted photos of before (with halogen bulbs), half-way upgraded (1 halogen, 1 LED bulb), and after (with both LED bulbs).I'm not crazy about the bulbs having cooling fans spinning at 10,000 RPM, as I imagine they might fail with all of the road grime that gets splashed up into the engine compartment.  However, they did seem to keep the bulbs cool.  After about 5 minutes of running, the bulb housings measured only 109F (see attached thermal photo).  I am more concerned about the LED/fan controller box getting fairly hot.  It measured 133F (see attached thermal photo) -- not a good temperature for electronics, as it shortens their life.  While the controllers were in a metal housing, they didn't look like they provide much heat dissipation.  They definitely looked like they could use a good heat sink.  I suspect the controllers will burn out long before the bulbs do...  If the fans don't fail first!  :-)Overall, considering I used to pay upwards of $40 for a pair of "blueish" colored halogen bulbs that burned so hot, they would fail within a few months, paying around $44 for a pair of LED lights doesn't seem like a bad gamble.  I am very satisfied for now.  If they fail prematurely, I'll update this post.Good luck!

And I'm a skeptic...  This was of course a "Not USA" product as usual.  Instructions were broken egnlish (joke) but helps to set the foundation for using this tool.  This was purchased to reset the air bag on my 2003 Z4 3.0i that I was REALLY obsessing on due the air bag light.  Spent day researching root cause and what could be the problem with 100 different stories from taking the seat out to $1700 in repairs to recalls.This tool reset the air bag in less that 3 minutes including the time for me to learn how to navigate.  I initially went to the airbag to reset and nothing (deep sigh) then I though to try the A pillar left and right and boom!  The error showed up on the right for the occupancy sensor fault 9915 and allowed me to reset and and SHAZZAM, the light went out.  I restarted the car a few time to confirm that it stayed out and it did.Root Cause:  I'm not really sure but the only thing we changed this year was using a battery tender to help with winter storage, but there are many others that state it's other things that I cannot speak for.  I'm going to leave the tender off to see if it reappears...I'll post the fault and the cleared dash...sorry that I didn't take one with the air bag on but this picture was actually send to my wife to show the fault was gone.Tool came in a case and seems to be a really nice quality - menu was easily read.  Illuminated keys would be nice for future models...but who really cares, the fault is reset...Good luck all...

This is an amazing product. It truly is a miracle! Wish I knew about it years ago. Can't say how many times I struggled to remove adhesive from a car and ended up scratching the paint.Don't waste your time using razor blades and scratching your paint; your fingers and getting blisters, your finger nails and breaking a nail; a heat gun and burning yourself; or Goo Gone and making a mess!What would have taken me hours to do in the past using the above mentioned methods, I was able to get the work done in 5 minutes! And the results were amazing. No double sided tape adhesive remaining and not a scratch!Buy this right now if you ever plan on removing vinyl decals or 3M double sided adhesive. You will thank yourself later.This eraser wheel basically works by creating friction and generating heat. It is no different then if you took a heat gun to the adhesive and tried to rub it off with your finger. This is just WAY more effective and effortless.Attach the wheel to your drill, put it on high speed, and apply medium to light pressure to the adhesive you want to remove. You will witness the adhesive being removed with ease!I am sure this is comparable to the 3M eraser/stripe off wheel but it was half the price. Glad I went with this. Saved me money and a lot of work. Take a look at the pictures of the Whizzy Wheel's work! Also, after removing the adhesive with the Eraser Wheel, I went over the area with Goo Gone to give it a good final clean.

I purchased this June 2013 and even after past 3 years, I still have 50% of the brake pads left. It brakes very smoothly and I am so happy I replaced it myself for the first time. I used to have mechanics do it, who use average quality ceramic brake pads, so I ended up replacing my brakes every 3-4 years. But ever since I replaced it, I thought I was nearing the time to replace until I took the wheel apart and as I bought another set of brakes and compared it to the brakes I have on my car right now, It's roughly 50% used.Note: I've resurfaced the rotor when I replaced them 3 years ago.Wagners are my go-to for brake pads.No squeeking noise, while brakes smoothly. Btw, don't forget to replace and bleed your brake fluids also.For those who are complaining, maybe check up on your brake fluid level? Did you even resurface the rotor?I hate reading dumb negative comments who put a blame on a product rather than troubleshooting the issue and trying to make the most out of the brakes. I hate people who can't even maintain their car properly and thinking pad quality can be measured simply by swapping out pads and driving it, without resurfacing the rotor while not bleeding out brake fluids. If you have done all of these while properly installing the brake pads but still get bad results, then you can prove it on here and I will take your review seriously. Otherwise, don't give this awesome product 1 star review. I don't even know how anyone can not like these brakes.Unlike most mechanics who use all sorts of liquid and oils, I didn't have to do anything besides putting lubrication on bolts.Update: I recently just purchased another one but this time, packaging is different and package says the pads are made in Mexico, opposed to made in USA. Pad width on the one made in Mexico is shorter than pad width on the made in USA one. Don't believe me? Here's the photo. Now, I'm not gonna jump to conclusion and just say it's crap. I'm gonna try out made in Mexico one first to see if it performs as good. I'll preserve made in USA pad for now and use pads made in Mexico.

Great product took about 15 minutes to install. 2" metal hole saw is required. Make sure to check amperage rating of extension cord for intended purpose. I would also suggest a bead of silicon around the hole underneath the gasket. Self tapper with 1/2in screws to secure.

These are the best, they open and close way faster and more accurately than the ones from autozone, napa, etc.I did an experiment and used this one, one from autozone and one from Oreilly's - I put them in a pot of boiling water and used a thermometer to know what temp each one opened up at.Although all three were supposed to open at 195*F, only the Stant opened up anywhere closed to that number. The other two opened up closer to 170*F. When I turned the heat off on the stove, the Stant closed first too. I repeated this a few times and the result was always the same.Why is this important? The engine (and it's computer) want it operating at a specific temperature. Too cold and it will be much less fuel efficient! Too hot and, well, that's called overheating and that's no bueno.Hope this helps!

This mount is ideal to relocate the speedometer on a Sportster. Simply drill out the mounting hole larger to accept the bolt for the front of the tank and install. A Perfect, inexpensive mod for Sportsters that remove the eyesore from the clamp area.

These LLCJ Super Bright White LED Car Light Bulbs are some really high quality lights! My fiances interior lights aren't bright at all so I figured we would try these lights. Installing these lights took only a few minutes to do and once we turned them on even in the daylight they were pretty bright.  I couldn't tell you how many times we've had to go into the car to look for something and of course it ended up taking so much longer because his lights were too dim for us to see. These lights on the other hand allow us to see pretty much the entire inside of his car so we can easily find things much quicker. These lights have definitely met and exceeded our needs! I would definitely recommend these LLCJ Super Bright White LED Car Light Bulbs!**I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**

I used two of these babies to support the front of my car (3700 lbs). It is more than I need but when I am spending hours under the car, I like the peace of mind. I also use chocks on the rear wheels and put the front tires and rims underneath as backup. I ordered these jack stands separately to avoid the issues with poor packing that other customers have pointed out. Mine arrived in new condition. The welds were not the prettiest but nothing that makes me not trust the stands. What I particularly appreciate is that the thick rubber disc on top of the stand mates well with the jacking points on my W203 Mercedes and did not cause any damage to their plastic supports. The car felt completely stable when perched on them. A lower price or more impressive finish would have garnered five stars - otherwise highly recommended.

Looks great! Love the mounting with the screw as I'm sure sitting in the sun the tape would eventually let go. Classy looking piece. See my pic of my boat dash above.5/18/2014 Update: No longer impressed. Battery needed to be replace, so I popped off the back, replaced it with a new cell, and then the fun began. After 2 days of trying to get the case backing on, I ended up cracking the lense and cutting myself doing so. No mater what I did to line it up correctly, the back would not pop back into place. Too bad, but certainly not maintainable, so it's not such a good product after all. Reducing the stars to 1And for the record, I replace watch batteries regularly between my watch collection and my wife's - I do know what I'm doing.

Decent quality but there is a seat issueBear in mind this part fits a lot of vehicles so I'm not too critical about an easy fixBasically when you plug in the connector give it a gental test tug by the base (not the wire of course) if it didn't lock you have to trim the lock tab so that the travel clears.Past that just don't twist the boltI think the bad reviews were by people who didn't seat them properly and that's why it was a rough idle.The sheering the bolt complaints were obviously by folks who think you have to hulk twist every bolt.

Maybe i over-thought this purchase but a '17 Grand sport is not a cheap car and I expected a lot of different values to this cover. All my other indoor cars are protected with a variety of different covers, most being thick generic ones that protect well but can be a bit of a pain to put on. I was surprised at how easy it was to install, especially when rolled out on the roof. It appears there is no way it will stretch to fit but it has amazing elasticity and easily covers my C7 with stage two areo. I'd have no worries about it fitting a stage 3 car. While it's not very thick and probably doesn't protect as well from impacts, the material is super soft and the best part is the shear fit that shows the body lines. Yeah, that's kind of cool when you open up your garage and see the outlines of a cool car as opposed to one that just drapes over the whole thing. So far i haven't seen any appreciable dust penetrate the fabric nor have i seen any dander from the material itself. So far i couldn't be happier. Just be sure to completely dust off you car before installing because i think this cover will collect and trap the dirt pretty easily. Also be sure to stow the cover in the included bag when not in use, also to keep it clean.

Easy Plug and Play install on Ninja 300. Throttle travel is much much better now. If throttle in tight after the swap you may need to add a little more cable slack at the throttle body adjuster if you cant get it long enough with the bar adjuster.

Perfect fit for 2006 Honda Element cabin air filters!  Very impressed that filters have complete instructions, WITH photos for that specific vehicle on how to change the filter! I didn't know the Element has a second filter slid in next to the first one till I saw the enclosed write up!  I got the TYC replacement Cabin Air filter for my 2001 Lexus- full instructions again- Thanks!

I chose this type of rack because it seemed to be the only ones where the cross bars can swing to the side and remain stowed when not in use.First thing, the vendor sent me PT278-35140 instead of the ###130. I assume it is the updated version as it still fit my 2010 Double Cab Tacoma. The install wasn't crazy difficult. Once I did the drivers side, I was able to install the passenger side within 30 minutes. I used thread locker on the threads of the 5(?) mounting holes on the roof of the truck and some silicon glue around the holes to make sure the rubber washers don't leak. As a bit of advice, install both rails but don't tighten down until you swing the cross bars across the roof and lock them into place. Then tighten the screws down. Even with doing this, locking the cross bars into position across the roof is a bit tight. Also the torque spec for these screws (in inch/pounds) seem kind of high so I just went to 90 in/lbs. Ive carried my 50 lbs kayak at 75-80 miles an hour with no problems.As other people mentioned, the trim part of the roof rack doesn't follow the contours of the roof exactly. It does lift up in the from a few millimeters but I think I got used to it. There's no difference in feel or wind noise when when driving at 80 mph with the crossbars stowed.Since there are no specs of this elsewhere online:Added height to apex of roof (When bars are stowed): ~3.6"Cross bar dimensions: 2.5x1.5" Oval/AerodynamicThe rear bar when deployed, clears the portion of the roof near the Satellite radio antenna by ~1.4"

This is really nice uv protectant. Goes on easy without leaving streaks or spots. Smells like their leather products. Squirt bottle easy to squeeze out just enough to work with, non dripping.I included a photograph of half dash done and dry, looks shiny without being glossed.I did one tire to see how it weathers, will have to update on that. But as an interior uv protecting shine, I am happy with it. Would get again.

Yes, it's cheap.  Yes, it's flimsy.  Yes, it works.  Yes, it arrived quickly.  Look, don't expect too much from this product.  It cost less than any of the other ones, made of light gauge, low end steel tubing, and it just feels cheap.  On the other hand, the added weight is not even felt when riding, it's easily tall enough, offers adequate ground clearance for road use, clears the chain and my feet, and makes maintenance and parking my eBike SO much better.  If you want the solid feeling of a motorcycle center stand, forget about it.  On the other hand, you'll be hard pressed to find more function for the buck.

Kit is pretty straight forward.  Instructions are clear and for the most part you get everything you need to get this item attached.  I opted to purchase the extended kit, which amounted to the 10pc. kit plus an additional small box.  My only issue with the expansion kit was there was not enough shrink tubing to cover all the connections.  I had to use some of my own shrink tubing, which was ok, but would have been nice to receive "everything" I needed.  Being careful to test the whole set, plan the installation, layout the pieces, dismantle the bike (fuel tank, seat and side covers all had to come off), prep the installation sites, install the lights, secure all the wiring and put the bike back together took me 5 hours by myself.  I imagine if I was doing this with a partner I would have cut maybe an hour off of this time.  Very happy with product.

Got the bumper, swing arm, gas can and high lift jack adapter setup.1) instructions on all of them SUCK.  Not very detailed and could have much better pic break down of each step.2) A pre-drilled hole stripped out. (Would be better with bolts that go all the way through.3) The whole set-up is WAY heavier than stock bumper.4) could have a better latch. Works ok, but just doesn't seem SOLID as described in the YouTube video.

Inexpensive way of applying tint yourself than paying 2x or even more from a tinting shop. Reason I bought this is because of the new NY tint inspection added to the yearly inspection. SUVs/trucks: no tint in front windshield and side 1st windows. Sedans: no tint in windshield, and both 1st and 2nd side windows. I believe you can tint rear just as long as you have rear view mirrors. Must have 70% light go through. Anyways I will remove the tint before inspection then order these and apply afterwards. The tint is fairly easy to apply. Just watch a few vids online for tips. Mine would be to take your time and prepping the glass is key. Making sure it's absolutely clean! to prevent bubbles popping up due to dirt etc. I added a pic. I only applied the tint to the front 1st side windows (35%) the rest is factory tint -'17 Toyota Highlander. The tint helps minimizes the heat from the sun and provides a little privacy. At 35% it's really not too dark. Cops haven't pulled me over yet. On my lancer which had 20% tint - $90 ticket. If you live in NY and you like your car tinted, I encourage you to petiton for the mandatory tint inspection be excluded. This hurts the customers as well as the tint shop owners/workers who make a living on tint. Only reason why I'm doing this myself is because every year I have to remove it.

Here's my list of PRO's and CON's from buying 9 different LED lights from AUXBEAM in the last few weeks.  I'm going to break it down for you so you can make a educated decision on if this is the light for you.  Most of the issues I had would be reason to return them but being that I have 17 years in aviation as a mechanic overcoming the quality control issues I had were workable.  Most people won't be so lucky.  Out of the 9 lights I bought 5 were defective.  I purchased the 4" 18W SPOT's and FLOODS and the 42" curved light bar and found similar issues with all of them.PROS:-very bright lights that exceed their price point-well designed housing and LED lens-waterproof after brief water testing-simple to wire and install with provided brackets-well packaged and shipping was very fast-CREE LED's performed better in my opinionCON's:  (here we go on quality control defects)-one of the 4" FLOOD lights had no threads at all on the housing.  I had to tap new threads into as seen in the pictures-42" curved LED light bar threads were painted internally making it impossible to thread the mount bolt on again I had to tap and thread the hole and bolt to clean up the threads-almost all of the lights had exposed wires showing from where the insulation had been cut back.  CHECK YOUR WIRES for this CUT MARK!-42" curved LED light bar silicon was leaking and required a heavy duty gasket maker silicon to seal it properly.UPDATED:  AUXBEAM helped me out and were helpful in resolving the issues I had.  I really like these lights but can't give them 5 stars until the quality control improves.

Great kit!! I was able to install these on a 2009 Base RAV4 with a J-Vin (Japan Assemblied) using the Factory Wiring by following a Modification write-up on RAV4world forum, see link below.  I also purchased this relay, Beck Arnley 203-0133 Relay for $6 off amazon (needed to use factory wiring, Toyota relay is $30-60) this worked prefectly.  What I did find is the Black wire for the Foglight switch is NOT GROUND, it can be tied to the illumination switch to light up the foglight switch from the kit.  The Red wire ties into factory fog light circuit and the Yellow wire is connected to a good ground.  Read through the thread on RAV4World it gives great direction on how to do this mod.  It can be installed without removing the front bumper cover with a little finesse.  My kit came with no instructions. [...]

Used this to float charge a gas backup generator (push start is only as reliable as the battery that cranks it over) only gripe would be that the LED indicator blinks a little too frequently - on smaller batteries this will eventually begin to take its toll when untethered from shore power.

inordered these in 2015 and just installed them and after a few bumps one works. When the worked they were good lights. I think the problem is the connection inside and since it's a sealed light I cannot open it and reconnect the wires.

This 12 SMD White LED dome light is very bright and i am pleased with it. If you are looking for a bright dome light for your car then this is perfect. I can actually see now and it's about twice as bright as the stock bulb and it is cooler and uses less amp. I highly recommend this LED dome light LED. If you want the brightest then go with the 12 SMD and not those 4 SMD and SMD. The 12 SMD is super bright and makes it crisp and clear in your car.Thanks for offering a great product for an affordable price and super fast shipping and great customer service.

I've been using Logitech mice for years, my favorite for general use being the Performance Mouse MX. however, when it started suffering from clicking issues which seem to be a common problem, I switched to using my MX518 full time. The MX 518 is a fine mouse but I've been having issues with it lately briefly disconnecting from the computer.I was casually browsing Amazon for mice when I came across this thing. I decided for $19 I couldn't go wrong.The mouse arrived today and boy do you get a lot of bang for your buck. It's constructed very well and has nice solid weight to it. The plastic has a soft coating on it that is pleasant to touch and the LED illumination is really cool. The primary buttons and the MMB click precisely and the scroll wheel is notched and very well damped. While the DPI speed must be cycled through (whereas the MX 518 has +/- buttons), I do like that its illuminated different colors to indicate what speed its in. It also has a switch under the mouse to toggle between 250Hz and 500Hz.This is the corded model NOT the wireless model. I chose it because the cordless model did not appear to have a port for a USB charging cable I have a USB port on my keyboard so the cord doesn't need to go for. The cord itself is actually braided which is a really nice touch.The only niggle I have with the build quality are the two side buttons, which have a bit more play than my Logitech mice do. However, they do click well. Overall though, it feels like a mouse costing two or three times more than it does.As far as comfort goes, the shape is nice for your palm and button figures, however its worth noting this is not as tall as some mice, which I'm not used to, so right now I find my pinky is touching the mouse pad. The thumb rest is rather short as well. I'm sure I'll get used to it though.As first impression go its made a very good one overall. If it lasts as long as my other mice have and I become  accustomed to holding it, I will be hard pressed to purchase more expensive brands in the future.UPDATE 10/4/15So its been over a year and this $20 has been complete trouble free. I use it for hours each day, from work to gaming and everything functions as it did when I bought it. More impressive is the finish, wish has held up very well with very little wear. On my Performance Mouse MX the finish began to wear and became glossy where my finger tips rested on the buttons. After a year the button on this mouse are still matte and clean up well every time. I use automotive interior detailer as its gentle on the plastic.

This worked great..... But I'm a highly qualified auto tech of all disciplines and it sucked. I had to cut out part of the unibody frame rails. Now I have to weld integral patches in. Two of the four were studs (one on each side) and the other two were bolts. Not what the directions said it would be... Three of the four snapped so I had to use my snap-on air hammer to knock them out... But now what? I had to use an air cutter to make access holes to attach. If this wasn't the case it would have been child's play. Good luck.

This is a awesome little pump foamer. I believe I saw this first on The Rag Company youtube channel. Never did use foam on my car. First time user. Tested with Chemical Guys Citus Wash and Gloss. Used about 5ml (1 teaspoon) to the 35oz of warm water. Anything more might strip the LSP. Used to clean wheels and wheel well.Foam is nice and tight. Very tiny bubbles that stick. Used the green adapter for a drier foam. It sticks better. There's a medium foam and a wetter foam. I like the dry foam just so it sticks longer. Works great. Foam sticked on the vertical and upside down parts of wheel well.Not too sure about using this to foam the whole car. This one maybe just for tires and wheel wells. I will be purchasing wheel cleaner and seeing how it works in this later. From reviews and forums this thing was built for chemicals.If you're trying to foam the whole car I suggest the IK Foam 9. Larger pressurized foamer. Kinda looks like a weed sprayer. The Foam 9 would be an alternative if you don't have a pressure washer to foam. I am considering the Foam 9...depending on how well the IK Foam 1.5 holds up.First photo is right after spraying. Second photo is about 7 minutes sitting after spraying. Will update later.

What a great product. Easy install, excellent quality.  The visibility is amazing.  The fact that they took the plate light into account is great.  A few other options on the market have no option for the plate light.  This is a drop in mod with excellent results.  I commute in heavy traffic daily and wanted a more noticeable option for my brake light.  My next install is a modulator for strobing the brake light.Edit: My bike is a 2000 V star 1100 Classic.

This thing is hella cool. I had my doubts when I bought it. However,  this device I bad A55! My wife thought it was all in my head when I told how much of a difference it made in my truck. Until she drove. She drove it in sport mode and it scared her.  Lol. The team at pedal commander were also very helpful when I asked a few questions after I bought it. Thanks guys. Amazing product and customer service!Now the wife has it in her Suburban. DAMN!  Very nice add on. Even though it doesn't ad HP you'll feel like you added an extra 30hp for $300

Better than I expected it to be when I bought it.  I expected a minor boost in torque and horsepower, but this is certainly noticeable.  The installation was extremely easy and took about 20 - 25 minutes from start to finish.  If you know much about mechanical work and are comfortable with what your are doing, this job will be done in under 30 minutes.  If you are not completely comfortable with mechanical work and need to look at the instructions, you should still be able to finish the job in an hour.It seems that this intake will increase mileage, as it doesn't take as much to get up to speed and coasting/idling is very smooth.  I have only just installed the intake, so I will have to update this review if the mileage does not increase.UPDATE: We just filled up today and we have increased 2 mpg, even though we have been driving a bit harder than normal while testing the intake.  I feel good about this, as it should get better when the computer gets fully up to speed with the change.UPDATE 2: We continue to get about 2 mpg better mileage since the installation of this intake.  The savings will add up over time and pay for the upgrade, so I definitely recommend the change.

The cord does not properly plug into the unit, but the seller responded quickly to my message. Extra credit for that! They asked for a photo of the cord issue so I've added a photo to this review. The socket on the supply is fine, I have other cords that work properly even though the supplied cord does not. (You should always keep old cords just in case!!)The product writeup does not mention the internal cooling fan. Having a fan (which others do NOT) implies that it can run hot over time and you must make sure the air vents are clear.Sadly, the unit will not drive the laptop charger I bought it for... It's a 90W charger for my Dell laptop which plugs into a cig lighter plug and draws 8 amps at 12+ volts when connected to a car battery. When connected to this power supply the current wanders from 1 to 6 amps while the supply's internal fan goes on and off every few seconds. It appears that this supply will only work with a resistive load (like a light bulb). It does NOT work with a reactive load (like this switched power supply:<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CAR-CHARGER-90W-65W-for-Dell-Latitude/dp/B0046HU670/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CAR CHARGER 90W 65W for Dell Latitude</a>UPDATE: I found another power supply that DOES handle my laptop charger as a load, you can check my other reviews to find it.

I was expecting so much more out of these things. I honestly can't tell any difference in ride except that I now have a tiny bit of bump steer. It has only been on for a few days so I will give it a little more time.I received a defective nut in the kit that required a trip to the hardware store.As you can see you do loose some ground clearance. I have about 3.25" of lift.Update: I installed an adjustable track bar and it made a world of difference. I definitely can now tell a difference in ride. My axel being a little off center must have been magnified from these. I do like them now and am impressed with the combination of TB and the brackets.I contacted Rough County about my problem and they got right back to me with suggestions and have been helpful. Good customer service.

I seriously don't know how people end up breaking this thing. I mounted it to a Honda Pioneer 700-4, and it's a beast. I abuse this thing, often putting far more weight into it than the 200 lbs it's rated for. I built some forks for it out of 2x4s, and I've carried gravel, logs, dirt, dug into hillsides, and pushed around fallen trees with it (like, 40 foot tall trees). This thing has handled everything I've thrown at it.

The absolute, perfect addition to the engine. Easy to install and an immediate noticeable change to the engine. Acceleration from a stand still is unbelievable. Shifts are soooo smooth.

I received this item within 2 days using amazon prime 2 day shipping. I installed this on my 2011 Jeep wrangler 2 door manual sahara. The item was packaged very well. I installed it along with a Volant Throttle body spacer. Overall, installation time took 2 hours. I used simple tools to install. For a novice like myself, the job came out easy and well and looks professional. Only difficulty I ran into was removing the air temperature sensor from the stock and also installing it into the new intake. You need to be very careful doing this or else it will break. I used a small flat head screwdriver to poke small holes into the rubber near the sensor which therefore helped wiggle the sensor out. I drove on the highway (Phoenix) and i got roughly 20 mpg with the throttle spacer, this air intake and a Sueprchips tuner set to octane 87 while my car is rated at 19 mpg. Overall, my horsepower and torque did feel an increase specially in 1st and 2nd gears and the gas mpg improved slightly, thought I can't tell if it was the tuner, the spacer, or the intake that increased the mpg or a combo of all three. It does look cool though. 5 stars, so far no problems. The engine isn't louder nor does it make any annoying noses unless to slam the gas pedal in low gears then you can really feel the kick and sound which is good.Update 1 Year later. The whole rubber backing of the filter ripped off while I was driving on a long trip, got sucked into my air intake manifold, and damaged my engine. I'm looking at about $600 in damages. Very disappointed

I was provided a sample to use and write an honest review.This is a nice tire pressure gauge. It measures quickly and the display is easy to read even in bright daylight. When I checked the measurements it was very close to my old slider-type gauge. I like the auto-on/auto-off feature. For most people this meter will be perfect.But wait. I'm left handed and the way I hold the gauge naturally puts the display on the bottom and out of sight. I thought just take a measurement and turn it over, but the display blanks before I can turn it over and read the display. Oops. NOT an issue for the right handed majority, and yes I can use it right handled but just a 10 second hold time would have completely eliminated this annoyance.In conclusion, if you are right handed this is a really nice tire pressure gauge. I like the concept a lot and would have been a completely satisfied lefty if the display stayed long enough to reasonably flip the meter before the display went off.  Accuracy seems quite good and it fits nicely in the hand.If you are right handed I think this is a 5 star tire gauge. As a left handed person I can only give it 4 stars because of the too quick display turn-off.Hope this helps someone.

To be honest I have seen the opt 7 led lights and heard some pretty good and bad reviews, but I was left undecisive between these and opt 7 and let me tell you these lights are pretty bright. I am really impressed with these lights and would absolutely purchase more of these for my other cars including buying two more sets for the high beams and fog lights. To be honest this company has the best customer service that I have ever encountered and they exceeded beyond expectations. I highly recommend buying these led lights without hesitation you will not be disappointed. In the picture the light is like it says pure white, no blueness to it at all. I have contacted this seller and out of the 10 others that I  have contacted to get useful information this company has emailed me every day fast responses and what a great service. To bad the others did not want my business and couldn't do much for me. Great job thanks for all your help.

Update; only a month later but this has been on when I went through 4 drive thru car washes (touchless 1/wk), used on 3 day trips & had it deployed for 1 full weekend. It was open for some light rain, decently steady wind with some stronger gusts & lots of sun. I LOVE THIS AWNING! Added pics in use....Original review: 5 minutes of opening it all up and thinking, 1 aha moment & 30 minutes to install. I was able to secure to my Reese rack with the (provided) ARB awning nuts & bolts along with the (sold separately) ARB brackets without having to drill. No wiggles, no jiggles & no extra noise that I've noticed. Very securely fitted.I will update my review once I've used it for a few months, but upon installation, deployment & tear down, everything went very smoothly.Clear instructions + actual durable materials= great off-road addition.

Battery was just fine until it went defective on me. The warranty thru amazon is great and they were pleasant to deal with however ACdelco says the battery is on back order and have zero information when I can get my replacement. Winter is coming up and I'm so excited to have a defective battery that I have to charge frequently over night so I can start the engine. Not a fan of a company that doesn't have anyone with knowledge about back ordered items and ETAs of new ones... Can't give a 5-star review on that.Only had the battery about 2 months before it failed.**UPDATE. It's 2 months later since I made my return claim and the replacement is still unavailable. Neither ACDelco or Amazon can tell me when this will be in stock. How can not one person be able to tell me when they plan to have more!? It's ludacris. I'm going to take my cash refund and buy a different brand battery. I print ally rated 3 stars d/t defect, now I've rated 1 star d/t ACDelco being run by brainless monkeys who can't complete the simple task of connecting me with who is in charge of battery manufacturing.The photo is what I do a couple times a week to charge my battery because it doesn't hold a charge  despite the alternator being able to charge it just fine. My vehicle nearly doesn't start at times. It's getting worse now. Time for a different battery and so long ACDelco batteries. It's too bad because they're rated well here on Amazon.

Came in a nice box. The spacer itself is good quality. The intake orifice on the spacer is noticeably smaller than the orifice on my intake plenum. (The big hole my finger is pointing to.) The instructions are confusing. The pictures on the instructions are such low quality that they are unintelligible. The bolts that come with it are too short, and so are the factory ones. So I will have to make a trip to the hardware store if I even want to install this. Comes with everything you see in my pic.**UPDATE**Went to hardware store and bought 2 long bolts for the front. One of the bolts that came with the spacer was long enough for the rear.

This is a review of the NOCO GC020 12V 2  Way Splitter.(These use standard DC plugs and sockets. Sockets are 7/8 in diameter.)Summary  I needed a splitter to put in my vehicle console so I could connect a phone charger and power a camera at the same time. I searched high and low for a quality splitter and this looked like it had all that I wanted. (See my feature list below.) Bottom line is that this is very sturdy and made of quality materials.There were two problems I did have though.1.) The physical dc plug which you plug into your dc outlet fit snug but would not stay in properly. It seems to have a 1cm distance it likes to push out to and while you can push it back in, the slightest bump will make it come out the cm losing its power connection.2.) The two outlets you plug items into could have been a little tighter. Plugs fit well, however, they seem to turn a little easy and have a little play.1st item I was able to resolve by slightly bending the clips and the 2nd item was resolved with a quick wrap of electrical tape around where the plug and sockets meet.As this item is being used in a vehicle console - is not visible day to day and since the item does work 100% with above modifications, I will go with a 3. One star off for each issue.Features-Uses thicker power cables which are 16awg which are capable of up to 15amps.-Has a removable fuse in the dc power plug. (Most do not of lesser quality.) The fuse is a 10amp fuse and is replacement.-The mold and design is very thick and durable.-Has caps for each socket in the event you do not need to use both at the same time for safety.

Button broke on first buttoning...and no I am not fat!...pant legs way too long.  Gave the company a chance and called ScorpionUSA directly, they never answered...left a voicemail....never heard back.  Pants are sweaty hot, when they are supposed to be breathable.  Had to but hip and knee protection separately, now it's all going back.  Unless you like poor quality and are 6'4 I would avoid this product.

Works great. The product arrived quickly, in easy to open packaging. The packaging for the camera was fairly decent. This inspection camera is very easy to install and use. The inspection camera itself is fairly well made from a good material. Package Include:HD USB Inspection Camera,CD Driver,Manual. The unit comes with a software which you install on your Windows machine(Windows XP and a lower version of the system without having to install software (plug and play), VISTA and Windows 7/8/10 need to install the software (with CD). It was easy to connect to my laptop and I would most definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good camera. Great for looking under, around and especially above things. The unit is also very lightweight.  I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.

It's really hard to install, true you do need patients. My girlfriend sadly helped me out and tried her best to even them out. It is really tough to do. I think this is as best as it'll get to be honest. Look at my pictures as a reference and you will see compared to others. It's tough, because you have to guide the tape to make sure it doesn't overlap at all. It'll take a couple of try and well you'll probably over stretch it.. I don't think it can be done percect

These lights are amazing. I put them on my daughters corolla and wired them into the lights. But they were way too bright to be used with dims for oncoming cars, so rewired them into the brights. They are easily twice as bright as her stock headlights. I used a wiring harness/relay from amazon. Wiring is easy. The lights are thin enough to be mounted about anywhere. They are seriously bright and we'll worth the money.Update: I liked these so much I bought a pair for my 1997 dodge truck. They fit right in the holes in the bumper slots. I did have to turn the mounting brackets inward to work with the bumper, I also had to get flat Allen wrench bolts so there was clearance between the light and bracket where it was turned inwards. Wired it into the high beams (orangish/red wire). They are so much brighter than my stock headlights. Highly recommend.(3rd Update) bought a pair for my Ford Excursion. If you want to really brighten the road, I'd recommend getting a pair and wiring into your brightss.

Product arrived with several of the 3014 diodes separating from the bulb itself. I noticed this before plugging them in so I tested them out. Sure enough they were not functional. My guess is the way they are being packaged together in pairs without separation. They easily get snagged on one another. What impressed me still was how bright these were even with several diodes not working. I mean BRIGHT. Emits a nice pure white color without any bluish or yellow tints. I wish I could order these again and be assumed they would arrive unscathed because the color and brightness was exactly what I wanted. I think the problem lies in its bulk packaging. The bulbs felt solid and not cheap like some others I have used. I don't believe it's an issue with the bulb quality I believe it is an issue with the packaging quality.

I have read a lot of comments on the internet about this product not working as expected.  My paint skills are ok, and I'm pretty good backyard mechanic, although I do less and less as the years pass.  I purchased VHT SP106 to paint the engine heat shield on my son's 2001 Honda Prelude which was rusted and dull.  While I followed the directions for the most part, I really did little different than any other spray paint job.  I did not prime.  I did take my time and not try to rush it.  Removed shield from vehicle; sanded as much rust off as possible; cleaned and wiped down with alcohol; sprayed at the recommended temperature and humidity (outside); did four coats waiting one hour between; and let it cure undisturbed for a week.  I did not do the oven curing step, and as far as the on the car heat cure, well just used the car normally.  Finish is great ! No chalking or peeling as some describe.  Time will tell, but for now A+.  I'll report back if anything changes. Now onto the intake.

I purchased this item because i added a tool box and lost almost two feet in cargo space in the process. I purchased the HD MAX model or the old U shape to maximize the space. The 74813-01A model it the one that fits the Ford F150 and Tundra. I gave it 4 stars because of two issues.The mounting screws are not self taping and the bigger issue. The instructions come with intallation templates that are too short. I placed the extender in position, leveled the extender and used a scribe pencil to outline the top of the brakets. They measured 11" at the very top of the bracket. Had i  installed using the provided template it would not have worked. With that being said the look  and feel of the product is great. I think because in 2012 the DOT started to require the V type extenders on trucks they do not have a specific one for tundra 2015

Definitely not the correct gasket for my 2000 Cherokee. I don't know if the listed part number is wrong or I was sent the wrong one or what. It was labeled as 35629 as the part number in multiple locations. However, this one is not the same that is pictured. First, it doesn't have that signature fel pro red sealent running around it. Second, it doesn't even fit the water pump.I have attached 2 photos. One is on the water pump that I bought from the Dealer (Genuine new Mopar part) and the other picture is next to the gasket that I had to run to the dealer to buy (part I bought here is on the left, dealer gasket is on the right). The price of this gasket isn't even worth my time to send back.I will say that the pictured item looks a lot closer to the one that the dealer sold me, so I assume that the picture is correct but just the part number listed here is incorrect or something. If you order it, just be sure to check it on a new water pump before you tear your old one out.

Great controller. A little shy on the instructions (none provided) so I whipped up a quick photo to hopefully help people determine if this will suit their needs and also how to wire it up.I found this to be pretty accurate once set and very consistent in the switching temperature. To set the device, an easy way is to set the temp probe next to a different probe (like a digital meat thermometer) and get the meat thermometer to read the temp you want the device to switch at. Then slowly turn the set screw until the device clicks on or off.

I used to have retina's. I looked into the light and I've not been the same since. It was like looking into the Heart of the TARDIS. yes, these lights are bright and I love that. The mounting brackets are really strong and allow for nice up/down aiming. There's enough tail wire to attach wire connectors. I used water proof connectors for quick plug in to my custom wire harness. All LED's work and they are super bright. After a couple heavy rains and car washes there is no sign of moisture inside the lens. The only thing this needs a guard over the lens to help protect from rocks or tree branches.

I purchased these 100 disposable plastic seat covers to cover my seats after the kids go to the water park by our house.  This way, I protect my seats from getting wet and getting that smell that wet seats get when they dry in a closed up car. These plastic covers are working great for that purpose.  They come folded nicely in a resealable plastic bag, so I can keep them in the pocket that is on the back of the drivers seat.  It takes no time to pull some out and cover the seats before everyone climbs in.  The plastic is thin, so it is good my kids are older and they don't mess with them.  It probably wouldn't work well for very young kids who would poke holes in them.....  When I get home, it is easy to toss them all in the trash.Obviously, these are made for mechanics and they would be great for that use too, I am sure.  I bought them though to protect my seats from wet kids and they are working great:)  This pack should last me the summer.I received this product at a discount for my honest review.

This is a no frills feeler gauge set. Not that any feeler gauge set has frills. It is your basic made in China, Lisle product. The quality is fine for what it is. The price is right. The measurements are easy to read. Perfect shape for measuring valve lash. Has the sizes I need .008 and .010 for Honda engines. Basically identical to a Snap On set I have, just different measurements and lower price. Thanks Lisle.Update: I loaned one of the feeler gauges to a coworker, and somehow his oily hands or something...the markings wore off. Completely gone. No trace of the printed measurements left. I had to look through all the other gauges to figure out which one it was. I then scribed the measurement on...very annoying. Subtracting a star.

We have an island stove with a bar on the backside. With company over or parties, it is nice to cover the stove and put out food on both sides for serving. It also gives the kitchen a clean finished look when the cover is on. This was a great gift to receive! The picture is after I treated it with Clark's food grade mineral oil. High quality almost furniture grade bamboo. Very pleased! This is obviously the 4 burner but I am considering getting the 2 burner only to use as a cutting board while I cook. I mostly use this one as a cover.

I bought this hitch to use on my Polaris Sportsman. I'm kinda disappointed in it actually.  It looks cool, but bends very easy. Where the square tube is welded to the flat plate, it has bent just under the weight of my yard cart being hauled around the yard with dirt/rocks etc.  I've bent it back, and it continues to re-bend.

because I keep getting ambushed by Sith Lords. It's more of an inconvenience than any of my other decals have caused. Just the other day I was riding down Atlanta highway and a TIE fighter swooped down out of nowhere and opened fire. It honestly stood little to no chance against my 1990 Nissan 240sx. I hit 2nd gear, slid through the parking lot behind Hardees and accelerated under the bridge and let out a sigh when I saw that ship collide with the bridge. If I would have known the potential dangers from having this decal I may have not ordered it, I mean adventure, excitement... a Jedi craves not these things. It's a pretty awesome sticker though.

Delete brackets fit perfectly. Took less than a minute to put them on. While these aren't 100% OEM, they were a little smaller than the original part. It's about an 1/8 inch smaller all the way around. Not really an issue but just something I noticed. Other than that, nice and inexpensive replacement part

I bought these for my 2002 Honda CBR F4i,  they weren't hard to install but it would have been easier with stands.  I've got stands ordered but don't have them yet.  Taking the wheels off completely and doing this on the kitchen table would probably give you the best possible result, but I didn't know how to do that lol.  They really do glow like the pictures,  Mine look the same and I'll upload pics if I can figure out how.  These are more expensive than other ones but the quality seems much better so I'm very happy with my purchase.

I got three colors and did a red, white, and blue theme. These are awesome! The resistor is built in so no need to add one for 12v clusters. Ignore all reviews saying they don't work they have to be soldered on the right way positive and negative. I just plugged the disassembled cluster in and held the led to the contacts to figure out which way to install. If you are rough with the wires they can come off the bulb but they are easily re-soldered to the back of the bulb. These things throw light in all directions and light up the cluster so nicely! There is simply no other bulb you want to use

Installing my third set now.  They will last past the 90 day warranty but go out soon after.  You have to take them apart, fill with dialectric grease, then silicone the heck out of them when installing to get them to last over a year.......then one day you go outside and notice another LED is out......argghhh. Next truck is getting OEM ones for sure.  Recon don't give a poo after 90 days....horrible customer service, no better product than the rest of the Chinese stuff on ebay.

I have tried many wheel cleaners on my motorcycle wheels with very little return on the effort of spraying the cleaner on and scrubbing hard.  After about 150K miles and 5 years of brake dust build up, I decided to try this cleaner.  It immediately started to soak away the extensive build up of brake dust, and continued to do so with the additional persuasion of a soft scrub brush.  After a few applications, the wheel was ready for wiping down with an old t-shirt.  I will say, that the product worked much better than anything else I have tried.  The wheel is pitted from the years of contact with the black brake dust, so, to regain the original luster, I will need to get out the buffing wheel after removing it from the bike and then removing the disc brake rotors from each side.  This product was amazing.  See before, during and after photos.

Like the other reviewers here state, the plug is very poorly designed in such a way that if you are not careful you can damage them with your load. They should come out the bottom, or side. The added visibilty of the rack is good to have though, so just be careful stacking things against the lights. I will try to fashion a guard.

The product has worked fine for over three months. It is well built and you will feel the difference when using it. It is easy to deploy and store. In my case, it was actually a bit smaller than I expected, but the cloth flaps in the corner allow me to easily fasten it to the sun visors on each passenger seat.

My plan on 2008 Nissan Xterra with full Shrockworks armor package:1) Raptor line skid plates2) Raptor line rock sliders, rear bumper, rear spare wheel3) Raptor line roof-rack, roof, roof plastic4) Raptor line front bumper, hood, sides of body following wheel-wells and Grocery cart protectorStep 1 =CompleteA) Shrockworks radiator, engine, transmission skid plates raptor lined.B) Process used:1) Lime-away toilet cleaner to remove rust from skids (works like CLR but is a gel so it stays in place), left overnight, then scrubbed with green kitchen scratch-pad2) 35 grit sand paper on belt sander, wire wheel on angle grinder to further remove corrosion.3) U-Pol Products 0776 ACID#8 Etch Primer painted on with paint brush (this is light gray color, throw away brush when done)4) bought 0.7mil paint plastic sheets ( 5 x 9ft*12ft at Home Depot for $9)5) New compressor 4-gal, 3.6 cfm @ 40, easily fast enough compressor for this job.6) Add 1-cup of hardner to liter bottle of raptor liner, shake for 2 minutes, then screw the bottle directly into the shultz gun7) Spray at 40-70 PSI, I used about 60 and was happy with consistant small pattern spray.  Spray from about 18" distance in sweeping motion like painting.8) Sprayed material (Black) contrasts the (light gray) primer, so you can see you pattern and coverage9) Front and back of 3 skids, roughly 20 square ft of coverage was a little light for 1 liter of material. Kit came with 4 liter bottles, but I figured coverage was good enough for the under mounted skid plates that  will not be seen, unless I roll my vehicle on the next Moab trip!10) Cleaned gun by pouring acetone through it and over it, very messy, I think I may use a bucket to catch and soak rather than using sink.What I learned:A) Respirator = $30  save yourself from the fumesB) paint coveralls = $8, save you clothes and skinC) disposable Nitrile 6 Mil Gloves $15 for 100 pack .. 2 days later I still cannot get this stuff off my hands and fingernails completely.7/28/2015: Looks good, Ill do step 2 in a month maybe...

I replaced the 4 OEM stabilizer jacks that came with my 2010 RPOD 172.  The stock jacks were very rusted.  The rear ones bolted directly in place of the existing screw holes after I removed the rear OEM jacks.  For the front two jacks, I had to drill 3 small holes to in order to install the new jacks.  Over all, I am very pleased with these stabilizer jacks.  They look great, folds away neatly, and keeps the trailer rock steady.  The only gripe I had is that it does not come with the PADS.  You have to buy at set of these separately.

This winch can be reversed to place the handle on the opposite side.  It's a very simple job, should take you about 15-20 minutes. You'll need a pair of pliers (for the ratchet clip), a 3/4" or 19mm socket (one socket and socket or crescent wrench) for each side of the main drum and a 13mm socket (9/16" socket) for the ratchet pin.  Take the drum off first, then unwind and rewind the strap in the opposite direction.  There is a clip that holds the gear shaft in place, use pliers to pull the clip off (you can see it in the close up of the ratchet line, it's on the right side in black).  The gear shaft has 2 collars that have a tab to align them up when you flip sides.  The ratchet stop clip has to be reversed, so make sure the smoother side is facing toward the plate under the winch.  The spring will go into the opposite side.  Flip the drum so the gear is now on the same side as the ratchet.  Take a few pics as you disassemble it, particularly the ratchet bolt which is the hardest to assemble.

It does dampen the exterior road noise, but not 100%. It is tricky to work with and you will need the tools (roller) to apply it properly. Be careful not to cut yourself on the foil backing and expect some tar on your hands from working with it. If you are purchasing Dynamat for improved sound from your car door speakers, it does work very well for that purpose.

This went on my 04 Silverado 5.3 z71. 20" wheels and 33" tires. 155k miles. I bought it for more mpg because I was getting roughly 10mpg before. Now with premium gas on the premium time with everything set to performance and tire size set, I went on a 190 mile trip for thanksgiving and my average was 18mpg. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because on models like my Chevy you have to pull fuses to change a tune. The acceleration is much better and quicker. Lots of low end torque. 0-60ish is fast after that it slows down a little. I like it for the most part. Good buy just be extremely cautious when installing and programming.

I used these with a MPPT solar controller. I really like the ability to use this as ON\OFF switches when I need to work with the live 12V solar system. Also, I like that they will trip if there is a surge over 20A and all I have to do is reset the circuit instead of buy expensive fuses that burn when a surge occurs.. These are clean, easy to assemble, accept a wide range of wires and work great.

So I installed this yesterday 10/09/16 and it was very simple to hook up. The most time consuming thing about the install is the disassembly of your motorcycle and the careful placing of the wires (I like to do a good job, lasts longer if you don't throw it together.) All in all it took me about four hours total. Let me tell you....this thing is AWESOME. I only hooked up the alarm, it is so sensitive to anyone touching the bike, but not standing around it. Very satisfied.I mounted the brain in the tail light housing and it fit just beautifully. (See pics) It sits right on the sub frame so any physical touching to the bike will be felt by the sensor. It is out of the way and not cluttered. I mounted the speaker in the side of the tail plastics. Fit great and it is somewhat open on the bottom so it really lets the sound escape. Speaking on the sound of this unit....THIS THING IS CRAZY LOUD.Very happy and will update as time goes on. For $20 this is Five *****See pics. (the second to last I'm pointing to the alarm speaker position.)****UPDATE - 1/17/17****This still works great. I do have a 9v battery plugged in for backup/safety drain buffer. I left my bike unplugged from the trickle charger for many weeks, but still started (with noticeable decline in battery power.) If you have a trickle charger, the problem of batteries dying is non existent. Very satisfied.

Performs great compared to light bars which cost considerably more.  Undersized screws in hard to reach spots prevented me from getting all the screws in,  it it seems to clamp down fine.

Can tell from a couple miles of driving the shifts feels smoother. Though that's probably because I had the factory filter on with 184k miles on it. Don't have to worry about my transmission going bad anytime soon with new fluid to go with this.Getting to it is a pain in the butt, though if you have the right tools this should only take 30 minutes tops.The tools I used were a 10 mm ratchet and a BIG extension (may need two), needle nose vice grips, and a pry tool for the lines since they were stuck on.I recommend taking off the intake hose and unbolting the one 10 mm bolt holding part of the throttle cable.I included a picture of the old, factory filter for reference and the new filter sitting in it's new home.

Bought two of these to mount on the grill guard of my Ford Superduty. I bought new clamp mounts as the included mounts look cheap and flimsy and involve drilling and I've heard the lossen up after a while and can't be tightened. For the money I can't complain. I received new and undamaged and have had on for a month through wet weather and they are still working fine. I do wish they were brighter but they are a bargain. They seem well made and have weight to them. The electric leads are easy to connect and I've connected them with separate harnesses to one switch. Hope they last a while.

Great look and comfortable but only good for 1 season (maybe).  The jacket ripped just off the seam behind my left shoulder.  It's as if the material isn't strong enough to support the weight of the jacket.  I contacted the seller for their suggestions on how to repair it... never heard back from them.

I originally ordered Feibing's dye to dye a belt. I still had almost the entire bottle left so I pulled out some old leather boots I had picked up from the thrift store that were really sad and worn looking and were in desperate need of some lovin'.I didn't have any leather deglazer but I did have some 100% acetone in my nail polish drawer that took the shiny coating off the boots really well (and its super cheap). After the acetone dried (and I had recovered from the brain cells I lost from doing this project in the windowless bathroom...seriously do this outside) I went over the boots a few times with the dye on wool daubers. After the dye dried, I gave the boots a few LIGHT coats of the resolene (I diluted the resolene with water to about a 50:50 ratio because I didn't want the boots SUPER shiny) that I applied with a damp sponge, per some advice from a few people on some leatherworking forums online. I am SO happy with how they came out!! They are beautiful and honestly look better than brand new. Such an easy fix for cheap boots you find at yard sales and second hand stores!NOTE :: Depending on the dye you choose, the dye is DARK. If you apply resolene on top, it gets EVEN DARKER. The belt I dyed (picture attached) came out almost black looking after I applied the resolene (I didn't dilute it). This wasn't a huge deal to me, but if you are wavering between two colors, definitely start with the lighter one...you can go back over it with a darker one if need be but you can't go back very easily and take off dye that is too dark. You know those instructions that say 'its best to test on an inconspicuous area or scrap first' ? I'm all for ignoring directions but in this case that is a really good idea :)I'm knocking off a star for lack of helpful directions. The best way I found to apply the resolene is with a damp sponge, as I mentioned earlier. I also dilute it 50:50 with water to cut the shine a bit. Its very flexible and doesn't crack along the creases of my boots.

Installed on my 2015 Toyota Highlander XLE-AWD today.  I love OEM but the price tag gave me second thoughts.  I saved several hundred dollars buying this vs OEM and so far I'm glad I did.The provided instructions are clear with color photos, even better is the video from e-trailer on youtube.  Installation was straightforward but it took me longer because I did it by myself.  It would've been a lot easier with a second person to help lift the hitch. It is pretty heavy so I had to use jackstands to hoist one side up so that I could bolt down the other side.  For the bolts you need a tourqe wrench.  I picked one up for cheap from Harbor Freight.The quality and finish is great, its feels solid and after installation it fits perfectly.  Just some trimming required on the bottom plastics.I have not hauled anything yet so I can't review that part but I am confident that it will do the job.

I at first ordered this same one but with the flat black ring.  I mounted that one and decided I didn't like it as much so exchanged it for the gloss black ring.  It goes with my truck theme much better and looks great!  The mount holes aren't a perfect line-up so I recommend only slightly screwing in each screw, center the ring, then tighten each screw a little at a time.  It mounts mostly flush but since there are only 4 mounting screws, the top part of the ring protrudes out from the truck body a little.  That is why I gave 4 stars.  It's not a huge difference and probably not noticeable to anyone but me or someone looking for it.  Also, a previous commenter said to remove the rubber bumpers and drill the gas cap cord hole first, before mounting the inner gas liner back into the truck and this was a good tip, I recommend doing that.

Easy to install and feel very snug. Major improvement over old handles that were faded and lost their clear coat sealer. I wiped down each handle with Paint Thinner before application, to remove any grease or residue. They look really nice for the price.

I will make this review as useful and simple as possible. These are not too difficult to install as long as you have all the right tools (i did except the pry tool), do not have any missing parts (push pins and panel holding pins were short on my order), and all the holes line up (mine did not, specially for the screws that go  up from under the flares.Now for a set of PLASTIC fender flares these are waaaaay too expensive and not finished right, there were a lot of plastic pieces on and around the edges left over. The holes that were drilled out had plastic left over on the inside, you can cut it flat with the box cutter but the problem was that they were drilled in the wrong spots. So i had to drill it into the right spot and that would make the hole too big (what a mess).IF and WHEN i ruin one or multiple of these fenders i am going all aluminum Poison Spyder fenders. I know it is double the cost but hey, i know they will do the job better (my friend has it on his JEEP JK and loves it, and they do look awesome and will take a hit on the trail).I mean these were missing push pins, no extra bolts or nuts (not even 1 extra each nut, bolt, washer)Misaligned holes.Half a$$ed finish around the edges and holes themselves.So bottom line:Would i recommend this?  YES, To the knowledgeable person who can make things work even in worst scenarios.Would i buy them again?  NO. I will go another route.Would i buy them again if it was $250?  YES, because to me that is a fair price for these flares.Pictures Before and after (I love the looks, but too expensive for the overall quality)

Absolutely amazing. I've spent so much time, money, and effort trying to keep my clear-coat aluminum wheels clear of brake dust. Was using Sonax before, but even that wasn't effective (and was incredibly expensive). I even got to the point that i was using wheel cleaner with a plastic kitchen scraper to remove the buildup (probably not great for the coat...). Have loved every CG product I have purchased, and this one may be my new favorite. 6-8 sprays per wheel, let it sit 30s or so, then scrub with their flag-tip brush and the caked on brake dust wiped right off. Took less than 5 minutes per wheel. I'm sure it will work better once I have the pressure washer out (still stowed for the winter). THAT is a result. Great product, fantastic price.

My truck is turning into a rolling OPT7 product line for a reason... I find the material quality and craftsmanship to be top notch!As the grand poohbah master of voiding warranties, I can say that the internals of this particular kit was made well!The kit came with everything you need for a very clean install with concise instructions and plenty of wire to do the job right. Even a key fob remote along with the printed membrane remoteThe lights are bright and they mounted to the underside of the bed lip with ease.For my kit I cut the wires and ran them through the factory loom into the dash cluster where I cut out a pocket on the C surface (behind the instrument shroud) and I hot glued half the box inside leaving the internal antenna coil facing upYou do NOT have to do what I did, the kit works perfect without modification. The kit is put together so well that the hack and slash customized job I did went flawless as well.

I am very very happy with the Tyger cover, It was so easy to install took me all of less then 10 minutes, and looks sharp and will hopefully help with some gas mileage. Even came with a storage bag when ya take it off you can store away. I didn't need the gasket sealer thingy fit perfect on 2014 Quad Cab. Thanks again Tyger and Amazon. and the bed light was a small surprise also.

I really like these lights. I thought they were plug and play into the hitch plug but no big deal. A little extra work to hard wire, a few Google searches to find correct wires and had them on in about an hour. I'm not a fan of the mounting clips. They are silver and need to be black as the stand out horribly and they offer little security as they are aluminum and can be easily bent allowing lights to be stolen. You'd think there is a better solution and I really didn't want to use 3M mounting tape. The last look and functionality is awesome. Doors open, the amber fades out and they are white. Good touch. Other than a little time finding the correct wires in my harnesses and crappy mounting brackets, I 100% recommend these. That said, I had pre ordered a 4 way 4flat splitter for the hitch. I could have always wired to the trailer plug. Either way, the white wire still needs ran to the hot side of interior light. In Chevy there is an easy access location under the dash on the BCM

Ill post a neutral review of three stars because they work, fit as described, but do not mount flush to the other lugs. If you do not mind a quarter-inch  protrusion  beyond the other five lugs, this is the lock for you. I have a 2018 Tacoma stock 16 wheels.  The photos do not adequately show but I think the 900 series set would fit better. Ill learn to live with it but probably shouldve gotten the 900 not these 901s.

I just installed this lift on my 2015 toyota tacoma double cab 4x4 trd. It picked up the front by 3" and the rear by 2" looks slightly leaned toward the back because of the difference so I would suggest to get a 3" rear block instead of the two. Eithor way this suspention was super easy to instal. With the right tools took 1hour. For this price everyone should buy it!!

omg!  i got these today, a little fearful that they would be too bright and/or might clash with my busy seat covers.  and they may clash, but i don't care.  i have the baja blanket seat cover set from bell automotive, and the blue is more turquoise, whereas this blue has less yellow in it.  the mats are very heavy and cover the entire bottom of the floor space.  if something spills on them, they aren't fabric and can be power-washed.  my friend found them to be awesome as well--i am a grandma and she is a great-grandma several times over so they appeal to the older female demographic.  ever the skeptic, i shopped walmart before buying these and found nothing comparable for any price.  i now look forward to looking at the floor of my tracker when i get in.  this is several days later, and my mom rode with me to dinner.  i didn't say a single thing or do anything to draw her attention to the floor mats.  she noticed them when she was getting out at the restaurant, and really liked them a LOT.  here is the thing: the aesthetic ceiling for floor mats is usually: "nice"; these floor mats, however, have a much higher aesthetic ceiling.  these floor mats are visually stimulating without compromising functionality.just went to a car wash and when i stepped back into my vehicle, as reported by other reviewers, the mats were slick.  not a big deal, i would still buy them for sure, but it is something to keep in mind that if you step into your vehicle when your feet are wet, your feet will likely slip on these mats, a minor loss in functionality, but i think it is totally worth it..

Some people may say it's not an issue but I'm a perfectionist it has to be right the first time .I have always been happy with BT product's over the years, but this isn't the quality or fitment ive been accustomed too. Was going order the rear mat but seeing these I may look at a different manufacturer for the rear and the cargo area.They are expensive for what they are in this case.

This organizer is well made and fit well on my 2001 Mazda B3000 4x4 pickup.  The only thing I don't like is the velcro pocket.  When you open the pocket it kind of drops and your stuff falls out unless you hold it with your other hand.  And one little square of velcro really isn't enough for that pocket, but it works.

I've waited a few months to post my rating & comments to provide an objective review. Upon installation along with a Throttle Body Spacer, we immediately experienced the check engine light as several other reviews have mentioned; K&N customer service was very responsive and simply cleaning the air sensor resolved the issue. Experienced substantial increase in pick-up from both a stop and while at speed. The H3 takes the climb up to 7,000 feet much better and at lower RPM than before installation. Gas mileage fluctuates, but generally about the same... my son loved the tone and was kicking into it, the net effect was -2.0 mpg., but once I called him on the data, we're running about +0.5 mpg. If your H3 can't get out of it's own way, you'll be pleasantly surprised with this after market upgrade. My only criticism is that the heat shield was not properly formed and we needed to shape it by bending the creases to properly fit the engine compartment.

Over rated on weight capability. Bought 4 of these to help level a small portable building. Total building is about 6k lbs. The skids are on the ground holding most of the weight. 1 jack twisted, the other 3 are too hard to turn to lift anymore, 1 crank handle bent and another handle snapped leaving my wrist bleeding where the jagged metal removed a chunk from me. My 2ton floor jack lifts the whole side of the building easy, not just 1 corner. I would guess these are more like 1000-1500lbs capacity.

I bought a used 2002 Ford Focus, not even thinking about keyless entry.  After finding out about two later (the first time my son tried to get in) that there is only a keyhole on the drivers door, it's gotten more and more annoying to have to unlock the drivers door, reach in and hit the unlock or trunk button.  After calling back the seller of the vehicle, I found that they hadn't had on for a long time either.After a while of searching I came across the BestKeys keyless entry fob.  Not only does it have a classic black look that I wanted (I never expected so many colors or designs for key fobs), but it directly fit my Focus, and was affordable to boot.  I was only hoping to lock/unlock the doors, so other passengers could get in, but the Trunk and panic buttons add both a different layer of accessibility, and a great safety feature.  The necessary battery was included as well as a set of instructions on how put your car into programming mode, and assigning the new fob to your system.  A lot of turn the key X amount of times, wait 1 second, do this...You should definitely read them through the first time, but they're really easy to follow.  I had my fob setup about 5 minutes out of the box.It's definitely a function that's easy to live without, but once you have it, it's hard to give it up.

This is much more useful and accurate than the floating ball hydrometers. When I get a car with an unknown coolant maintenance history, I like to flush the system out with distilled water, then add half the coolant capacity with concentrated antifreeze to get a 50/50 mix of coolant and distilled water. The problem is you don't know how accurate the listed capacity is, and you don't know how much residual coolant is left in the system. This tool solves that issue. I tested it with distilled water (picture included) and then with a few different cars that I already knew the coolant ratio. This refractometer gave me the values I was expecting. I then tested another car that my ball type hydrometer was showing barely adequate freeze protection, and sure enough, it showed me to be at 43% antifreeze. With my ball hydrometer, I didn't really know exactly how low my ratio was. With this refractometer I could easily calculate out that I need to drain out 0.7 quarts and add that same amount of concentrate to get me to the 50/50 ratio.The ATD refractometer lists the antifreeze % as well as temperature protection in degrees F. Many of them only tell you what the freeze protection level is, and you have to find a chart to determine what the ratio is. This is one of the reasons I chose it over similarly priced models. I like to be able to read the ratio directly without consulting a chart.

So, anyone who has ever worked on German cars knows that they can be, shall we say, finicky. That being said, I bought these for my 2005 Audi a4.Installation took about 20 minutes tops. I was very, very surprised (and elated) to find they were truly plug and play, with no relay harness or capacitors to deal with.No flickering, no dancing, no failure to ignite. To say I'm pleased with this kit might be the world's greatest understatement.

There grips are great! They work fantastic on my 16 RGS. My only complaint is that there is not near enough glue with the left grip. It spun loose after 2 days. I had to pull it off after a week and apply some better glue to hold it to the bar. Other than that, I am truly enjoying these things.

This item is a great addition to any jeep.Directions are good and easy to follow.Removing the old latch on the bottom of the hood was difficult. Make sure you have a 13 mm flex socket to make it easier.

Nice solid toilet seat but the separate plastic piece that covers the water valve attached to the back of the toilet arrived broken. Does not affect the seat and not readily noticeable unless you know where to look. The outer box wasn't damaged though.

I actually didn't use this to mount a light bar, but to mount my Hi-Lift Jack in my Jeep Wrangler TJ. I have a Poison Spyder full roll cage in my Jeep which is a lot smaller in diameter than the fatory roll cage so I figured Id try these mounts with the different sizes they come with. With the smallest rubber insert, they fit perfect and are extremely sturdy. They hold my Hi-Lift Jack perfect. They seem to be a quality made product and for a price you cant beat. Well see how they hold up over time. Way better solution to mounting a Hi-Lift jack to a roll bar than spending $75+ on a Hi-Lift brand mount.

UPDATED 8/7/2016: I have been using this foam gun with my electric pressure washer, at around 1650PSI. The foam lance works VERY well as you can adjust the amount of foam via the screw cap on top. Check my picture for example. Everything is working great. THE FIVE STAR RATING STANDS.I received this foam lance at a discount for review in order to take my detailing game to the next level. A foam lance does wonders to encapsulate dirt particles and allows for an even more efficient wash with your pressure washer! The Fasmov foam lance has a very heavy duty plastic container for putting detergents into, and a brass connector for those quick-connect valves, a black cap on top that allows you to adjust how much foam is dispensed, and the cannon head itself. I used it to wash my car this past weekend and it worked WELL!

This product is cheaply made of cheap materials. It is far overpriced.  "Made in the USA"?  A paper insert found in the plastic bag in which the item was placed clearly states it was Made in China.  I am very disappointed by this purchase and am returning it immediately.

I bought this to upgrade my disabled Corgi's mobility unit. The emblem is well made and looks like OEM installation. As you can see from the before and after photos it will make a HUGE improvement in the appearance of any vehicle on which it might be installed. I highly recommend it and TullyMars gives it a rare 5-bark rating. Heads up......you might want to buy two just in case. I've caught a couple of guys showing way too much interest in the emblem when they thought no one was watching. Not to worry, when the Walkers come, losers like them will be eaten in the first few days.

These are great. I used them in a couple Auto Meter Sport Comp 2.25" gauges in pods under my dash. I'm converting my instruments from incandescent bulbs to LEDs, and from green to blue. You can see the blue LED on the left gauge and the standard incandescent bulb with green filter on the right gauge. The pic is a little fuzzy, but you get the idea. Obviously I eventually put the blue LEDs in both. They are not too dim or too bright and they really make the gauge needle light up. I'm very happy with the results.

Overall: great product for the price!  Pictures show this is indeed a true sine wave inverter. Note first plot is voltage waveform with a 60W incandescent light bulb. Second picture is with the light and a 65W laptop power supply charging half-drained battery.  Amplitude in pictures is not to scale due to homemade voltage divider. Pros: True sine wave. Small package size. USB chargers, actual power switch.  Notes: voltage is created line to neutral, meaning there is voltage on the neutral terminal. However, It appears that AC ground terminal isn't bonded to DC negative.Others mentioned fan noise, however I haven't yet heard it turn on - likely due to relatively light loading and short time of investigation. Looking forward to using this on our next camp trip.

I installed this today on our 2014 GMC Acadia.  Installation is pretty straight forward.The kit included 4 screws & plastic washers & 4 clear bumpers.After you open the hood carefully remove the 6 plastic push snaps that holds the dust shield in place.(you will need 2 to re-use or get new ones from auto-parts store)Place the 4 washers on the 4 screws.  Push them through the outer 4 screw holes on the dust shield.  The rubber will hold them in place.Place the guard on the hood & align up the screw holes.  You can start one screw on one end to hold the shield in place & then move to the other side & start installing the 4 screws.Install & tighten all 4 screws.  Use 2 of the push snaps you saved to hold the middle of the dust shield against the hood.The 4 clear bumpers are then attached to the underside of the guard where it would hit the hood.  I installed mine on the very ends and where the crease in the hood is on each side.Entire process took less then 10 minutes.  This blends in very well with our black paint job.  It does not seem to interfere at all with closing or opening the hood.  With day 1, so far so good!

This is a very good hitch, however I had to deduct a star because it did not specifically fit my vehicle. I bought a used 2015 trailhawk and suspect that it was prepped for a tow package since it already had bolts and welded nuts in the frame. I removed the bolts thinking that the holes on the Curt hitch would line up, and they almost did. I was able to get the bottom bolt into the square hole as demonstrated in the youtube video and also a side bolt that was removed when installing the hitch. I could not however, make the second bottom bolt line up. It was about a half inch off. This isn't a major concern for since I will not be coming anywhere close to the load ratings but would have been nice if it had lined up to be able to use. I will probably take it off sometime in the future and take it to a machine shop to have the holes elongated in order to add the second bottom bolt to the hitch if just for peace of mind.

Nice bag. I modified it to fit my Memphis Shades Fats 9 windshield on my 2000 V-star 1100 Classic.  I modified the mounting tab to fit my windshield.  I cut it to 3 1/2" tall and placed the mounting holes at 2" from the bottom. Caution to anyone, while mounting, the ends of the support strip has burrs and you may want to sand them down or you risk scratching your windshield like I did. I think it looks great. it is big enough to hold a small first aid kit, cables, and parts for my RAM mounts.

I wanted to be able to line the bed of my Jeep Wrangler JK so that I could transport the dog and carry trash down the driveway without making a mess of the carpet. I've got this, it's installed and it fits the bill (attached photo is dirty because I took the dog for a very muddy walk).Getting it installed was very simple. I had to cut out the four holes for my 2-Door Wrangler, but the guides are in exactly the right spot. I checked before I attempted the install. It was very easy to cut through the liner with a utility knife while sitting it on wood. The only hard part of the install was taking out the seat (which, as you know, isn't that hard). After that, the liner went in and the seat went back. Everything fit.Almost.The seat latch was stiff. The holes were right and cut, so it wasn't interference there. I think the added thickness of the liner made it a little harder to latch the seat. Slamming it down did the trick, and the second time was easier. Hopefully, it will get easier still over time. This is the only thing keeping this from being a five star review. Also, the edges of the liner that extend towards the back seem a little floppy, but I think this is a minor issue over all.The fit is right (enough). The material is exactly what I expected. I'm very pleased with this addition to my Jeep.

These are awesome! I have them installed on my Dodge Charger they look great too. The old rubber valve stems used to let out air slowly. With these no more air leaks there are no instructions but it's not too hard to figure out how they go on. Tighten them enough to just flatten the triangular shaped cone rubber washer.Note: I replaced all the inner cores with slime cores to avoid additional leakage  from the gorilla manufacturer

I received the battery tender on April 30th and I connected it to my new 12 volt battery connected to my $4000 Hustler Zero turn mower which I just purchased a few months ago. It worked fine until June 25th, when I noticed the green light was solid red. I connected it to another 12 volt battery in my car and the battery tender just stays on the red light. Not for sure why it quit working, but I have now passed the 30 day window mark to return it. Apparently some of these 12 volt 750mA Deltran battery tenders are Junk. Less than 60 days and it quit working.

Borderline satisfaction. I definitely like it more than the Mopar OEM composite shroud, but this product could have been designed to fit better. I mounted it on my 2013 JK 4-door and was disappointed with the fit and coverage. In terms of fit, it does not mount flush. Not a big deal, but I question why not? In terms of coverage, it does not fully protect the sway-bar mechanism. It should have extended another few inches back.

I bought this because I needed to replace the missing carpet from my Jeep Wrangler.Not only did I pay too much for seemingly cheap foam "carpet" but I missed that you don't even get the full vehicle carpet for $211 USD.You only get the rear area so you'll end up paying $400 for cheap foam carpet for your beloved Jeep.What ever happened to getting a good product without paying too much?Find another product because this is not at all worth their asking price.Update: Despite my misgivings about the cost and apparent feel and quality of the product, it does look good after installation.See image.

Im actually debating buying another for my truck as a rear facing light bar!!! If your tring to put this on a full sized truck id recommend  buying a longer one just so it looks more fitted for it... i think this would look silly but to each their own. ... would also work awesome for a guad or gulf cart

The bumper seems pretty solid and definitely was an easy install. No modification was needed whatsoever. The only downside to this product is that it started to rust almost immediately the week following installation. We had some rain here in town. I contacted the seller and they did offer to replace the item or refund my money so props to them on that. However, being that I threw away my old bumper, neither was a great option. Instead, they credited me $30 towards my purchase for the trouble. Good customer service but I can't give it 5 stars because it still was a big issue. I'm touching up all the spots that had powder coating issues myself.

This is a super sturdy, reinforced collapsible two-compartment bin that you can use to organize or carry a variety of items. When collapsed, this resembles a little suitcase. This is my second one of these types of carriers and this one is much stronger than the first one with panels that lie flat on the floor of the open organizer, handles that are made of thick woven fabric and attached to the sides, and plastic inserted into the sides to make them sturdy. My former organizer had little ribbon-like handles sewn into the seams of the top edges and one quickly broke free of its seam and became useless. There are also pockets on the outside which are good for tucking in extra items. I like that the organizer can be stored relatively compactly when not in use, used as a single bin by using the adjustable snap straps to set the size, or used as a double bin according to needs.I'm not sure how other people use this organizer, but I find it really useful for carrying somewhat large amounts of groceries to and from the car as it's easy to load a couple of large paper bags into it or four or so plastic ones and grab the handles and carry everything in at once. I use my older one as an under-the-shelf organizer (since the handle broke) for cleaning products and I will probably get another one of these to put on another shelf for organizing. I like that the outer pockets on these types of organizers can be used to store trash bags, towels, or dishcloths that can be readily accessed when used under a cabinet and that it's relatively light and can be pulled out easily to access the contents inside. I really do appreciate how flexible these are for organizing a variety of spaces while being so light and capable of being compact when needed.Note: I was given a free sample of this product for my assessment.

This was a relay I used to replace the worn out BOSCH 0333204125 5 pin relay for an old, mid-80's ONAN BFA 4.0 RV Generator. I was refreshing the entire electrical after many slow and failed starts and just got sick of it. After spending some time researching I managed to get the right start solenoids, fuse holders and other bit but the relays were listed all over the interwebs as NLA.  After pulling the existing ones I figured these would work for the job, having the same pin layout. Installed them and now this 32 year old generator starts with a flick of the switch!! WOO HOO!

I purchased several boxes of these lights during 2016.  Although there were some quality-related issues as noted by other reviewers, the light output was very bright and very white.  In January 2017, I purchased two more boxes of these lights and was disappointed to see they had changed.  The light output is not as bright as the original ones and the newer ones have a noticeable blue tint.I contacted the seller, RioRand / Vancouver Sun, with my observations and concerns.  Seller replied that their supplier had recently "upgraded" the lights but not to worry because the new ones were just as bright and just as white as the original lights.No, they are not!The picture shows the original style (top) and the new style (bottom).  Note that the original style had multiple rows of discreet LED's in the COB panel.  These are the little "dots" you see embedded in the yellow material.  The newer style has only one row of such LED's.  A side-by-side comparison of the two when lit revealed the newer style puts out less light and has a noticeable blue tint - just like those cheap and annoying LED's bulbs sold all over the net.

I was tempted to go really cheap on the washer pump but the scary stories swayed me away from them.  But I still didn't want to pay the BMW dealer price for this pump so I went with the VDO/Siemens/Continental washer pump.  Not sure about the labeling.  Mine says Continental on the side.  The pump itself is very well made and uses very good material similar to the BMW OEM pump it replaced.  I was worried about the pumping pressure based on the cheaper pumps' negative reviews.  But I'm happy to say that this pump performs just like the OEM unit as the other reviewers here testified.  I paired this up with the www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G6MOG0/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 grommet, which has the plastic strainer missing from my classic BMW without any loss of efficiency.  It took a total of 20 minutes to replace not including the cleanup I had  to clean my garage floor after almost a gallon of Rain-X washer fluid was dumped onto it.Anyway, I highly recommend this pump if you're looking for OEM performance at a cheaper price.  Not sure what the dealer charges for this job but there's really nothing to it if you already have the tools.  I'll update this review after a few months to report it's reliability.

Typical LED with the flickering, I put these in my dash in 2014 and in 2015 three out of the eight are flickering. I really wish they would stop the claims of LED's lasting long, they don't. Cheap ones, pricey ones, they're all the same. Being on the cheap side they do the job, they just don't last long as LED is usually advertised.

Received these First Alert Emergency Beacons today and I was stunned by how ineffective they are outdoors in daylight.  At night they might be marginally effective but I wouldn't give them over 2 or 3 stars even at night due to the small size of the LED output.  What a joke.  When your safety is at stake and you want other drivers to give you a safety margin a bright and large signal is needed.The flammable road flares or reflective triangles are much better options.  These beacons are going right back.  How they received so many good reviews is beyond me.I have included a photo comparing the First Alert Beacons with just 1 reflective triangle.

Honesty, I did not receive what was pictured... What I got was actually better, as it was still OEM Ford, but it was in the style of my attached picture. One end is a ball point touch up and the other end is a sponge brush. The top for the ball point is actually a nick sander to take care of any surface rust. This matched my white 2012 F-150 perfectly.

These hinges are well made and the powder coat or paint complements my travel trailer.  I used these hinges to extend my kitchen counter top with a folding shelf.  I lift the shelf quickly and lower and the shelf brackets lock in place, occasionally need a little help to lock.  Lift the shelf and manually start the bracket folding and the shelf folds and it seems to lock down in place and doesn't flop around.  I like that.

its been so-so. The passenger side wiring was mixed up by builder & the plastic light assembly wasn't staying put. We discovered the tab was broken. Sadly it sat at the shop (in the sealed up box) for a few months before I was healthy enough to install them, that is when we discovered these issues. I still have to find spare time to cut, re-splice the wires correctly and then crimp & heat-shrink seal them ... and reinstall. I tried to email them 2 times over 6 months ago but, don't recall ever getting any reply back then. 7/19/18 the pass light assembly flew off last night on trip to Galveston. So.(shrugs) I guess I'll have to find a replacement set of LED light assemblies for both mirrors now?

Two females (my wife and I) installed this yesterday. The hardest part was getting the factory stuff OUT. I think some of the installation steps could have been more detailed, but luckily there was youtube. I also think, considering the price point, that 4 small hose clamps would have been included. I don't like the fact that the valve hoses are just there and not really secured. Overall happy with the purchase so far. It sounds great.

Got 1 for driver side of my 2002 Xterra. It was simple to install. Has buckles on head, back and under seat straps like on child seats! Click, done. Has hook strap in crease of seat to hook under springs or frame to keep it pulled tight against seat.  Seems very sturdy . Fit my xterra perfectly. I give 4 stars bc I prefer back of seat to be covered but it looks neat and price was right. No odor at all on mine. Ordering another tonite for passenger side.Update 6/1/17 Ordered another for passenger side. It matches other one. Same high quality.  No odor . Mine do not shed.  It is hot in NC now but they do not make me hot. So soft and cushy!

We'll I am pleased as punch. It fit and looks identical to my factory Ford light. I'd have no hesitation about getting a full set. I was going to bring it to my mechanic to install as I have some serious back and neck problems but it was just 3 small screws that were very easy to access. You'll need a socket set and a deep socket or a very short extension to reach the farthest one as the horn is in the way. I took a bunch of photos attached to this review. These are SAE approved.

I contacted the seller by email and asked several times if this was a direct bolt in and they assured me it was. But when I tried to install it the fittings on the oil cooler side don't work. The threads are not deep enough to allow a proper fitting. It's clear they have never installed one of these. I had to waste the better part of the day looking for fittings that will work. It's also 114 degrees outside and I would have liked to finish quickly. if the seller would provide the proper fittings I would have given this a better rating. I would even have paid more for the item.Edit** As several other people have noted the oil cooler fittings on the driver's side will not fit right. You have to cut off the standard fittings after taking off the o-ring on the end. The threaded insert on the radiator is not deep enough to get more than a few turns unless you do this. Also be sure to use thread sealer or teflon tape to make sure you don't have leaks. I also could not get the lower shroud back into the slots due to the thickness of the radiator. The overflow hose is also too big and you will either need a slightly smaller hose or use a screw type hose clamp on the radiator side. I have a 2000 S-10 ZR2 with a 4.3 V-6 and it comes close to being a perfect fit. With a few tweaks this radiator could be very good but I assume they built this as more of a universal radiator to fit several applications?07/11/2017** I decided to come back and rate up this radiator. I was disappointed in the service of the seller for not knowing what it took to install or not even offering to sell fittings that work. Putting all of that aside, the radiator itself seems to be a quality item. My truck seems to run a bit cooler and I don't have to worry about the plastic tanks anymore!

I mounted this on my EZGO golf cart and I love it!! I was going back and forth between this and head lights. I am very happy with my choice. I had to make my own brackets but I assumed that when I bought them.Easy install, but I have done wiring for a long time. This comes with everything you need to make the light work. Assuming you have a battery already... And I used my own butt splices.Will buy for other projects in the future.

Well..unfortunately I have an update..the high beam in my driver side is no longer working at all..I've contacted the company and will update again when I get a response. Mind you, they've only been installed since December 9th..Love them! took maybe 30 minutes to install because I had never worked with wiring on my jeep before. I did NOT set up the blinking amber part because that freaked me out. But, my halos come on with my day time runners and the lights are so much brighter! So stoked, cool look on the Jeep now! Would so recommend!

If you are looking for a low cost and simple way to mount your jack, this will work nicely. The install of this setup is fairly simple. The brackets are of decent quality but the hardware is lacking a little.If you choose this setup I would suggest mounting it first before drilling out your hinge covers incase you don't like it or your jack doesn't fit. The HF farm jack fits well in the base.My jack does make contact with the light if the gate is opened completely. The solution I found was to not have the jack in the full down position.The design of this setup doesn't include a way to lock your jack securely. You can use a cable lock and or Rampage Part Number: RPP86613 or an equivalent lock. Both these locking methods are easily defeated but deters the grab and run theif.I haven't had any issues with the bolts coming loose like others have posted.This setup is about $60 less than others and does work well.UPDATE: The bolts that secure the jack to the mount finally started to work themselves loose regularly. I just put nuts and lock washer on that I could tighten with a ratchet and that fixed that. $.40I still like it.

This  adjustable foam washer will be great for cleaning our camper. That thing gets filthy on every camping trip and just the power washer alone does  not produce enough foam to give it a good cleaning. I decided to give it a 1st time test on my jeep, It was a bit tricky since the top is off my jeep and will stay off until it gets cold out. Plus it was hard to  show in the pictures because my jeep is white and it is sunny out.This is super easy to fill the white bottle with car washing soap and attach it all up to the power washer with the quick connect connector. The plastic bottle holds about a quart of soap. I hooked it right to the end of the power washing wand. It really seems to be heavy duty and all the fittings appear to be brass. There are 2 adjustable nozzles on it. 1 is for the foam and the other is for the water and it is really easy to adjust the 2..It foams up great and between that and the power washer my jeep really cleaned up nicely.  I can't wait to get the camper out now to test it.

If you're looking for a "narrow far reaching beam", look elsewhere. These lights do not produce any real output. They are good if you only want to "look cool".As stated in another review, these are the same lights as sold in AutoZone or AdvanceAuto stores.The housing is made from pretty durable plastic, and the lens is glass.It comes with a wiring harness that can be used, but is of a low AWG wire.They are pretty shallow in depth, allowing you to mount them virtually anywhere.

I purchase a 10 year old rv that the previous owners live in it full time for  about 9 years. The grey water showed 3/4 full and the black showed 1/2. I used 1/2 in the grey and the other half in the black and filled the tanks to about 1/2. I let it sit overnight and then drove the coach 250 miles. I dumped the tanks at my destination. The gauges now read properly.

This Toll Pass Holder is excellent for motorcyclists with windshields. With the three suction cups it will not come loose, really!! Just trying to remove it takes some effort. Also once you slide the EZ Pass into the holder this thing will not slide out without  effort so no worries folks. The last EZ Pass holder i purchased on Amazon from another Seller flew off my bike and I lost my EZ Pass, that cost me $16 bucks!!!UPDATE: the plastic taps become brittle (maybe the weather) and brake off so i've had to resort to using a paper clamp to secure the holder to windshield. Eventually I lost my EasyPass again.

These are exact replacements for the generic lights found on the outside of RV's.  Installation is very simple because there's only two wires... recommend you put some silicone caulk around the wire hole in the back to keep water out though.

Not a bad item or fit, but a bug deflector it is not. this just sticks to the front edge of the hood with 3m tape. I painted it white to match my truck but it did not look good to me. I removed it. I added stripes instead.

Don't waste your money....  As stated before, instructions are a joke.  But the biggest problem is that the bracket and locking mechanism do not line up and the bolts are too long.  I can't understand why the company does not test these on the vehicles they say are designed for.  I can't even use the latches and will be sending them back.  Should have saved my money and bought the Generation 1 for 1/2 the price.  Problem is I installed the front ones and they are good.  Now I have to send back all 4 doors back to Amazon for a refund.

Like others with 2011 Subaru Outbacks I noted immediately it didn't fit the drivers side just right. I hoped it would settle in and still I find that after a couple weeks there is definitely a little issue. It doesn't really fit just right. There is that gap by the door and when I get in, dirt is falling in there (we have a dirt driveway). The others seem to fit fine, it's just the drivers one, which is unfortunate since it gets the most use. I vacuum it under there once a week but that kind of defeats the purpose for me.Considering using some kind of tape to get it to stay in place. I'm thinking electrical tape across the gap may help and be easy enough to remove if necessary.Understand they are certainly picking up lots of the dirt, it's just not what I would call custom fit exactly.

Excellent lights! Extremely bright, and really cool look. Would have been a 5-star review, but lights weren't "plug and play," on my 2005 HD Heritage Softail. But if you know how to install a male disconnect on the end of each wire, it's a very simple 15-20 minute install total. Would definitely recommend.

I have been using this particular style McGard wheel locks on various vehicles for over 30 years. I recently purchased a set of 5 for my Jeep Wrangler JK. The material quality is as good as it always was. It is good that they offer them in sets of 5 for those with externally mounted spare tires. The locking lug protrudes slightly above the others, but this is expected because of the locking crown. I had no issues with stripping the key lug, but then again I always use a torque wrench observing the mfg spec. In this case, the Jeep manual states that the wheel nut to be torqued at 95 ft lbs (130 Nm). Some might think that the protrusion would lend to loosening with a vise grip or other grip-plier set, but the protrusion is not enough to grab the lock at 90 degrees and if you try vise grips straight-on, it is doubtful that you could over come the 95 ft lbs of torque. Besides, I use these as a deterrent, not for a foolproof methodology. Mainly for the casual thief to move onto an easier target. For a professional, that's what insurance is for. But I have never had a wheel theft issue in over 30 years using McGard. The attached pics shows them on the road wheel and spare wheel.

For the price you can't go wrong.  Not the most difficult of installations plus I already had it wired up with LED strips which I ended up tying into this set up.  I give it four stars as I am not really impressed with the sound function of set up. They don't really bounce, move, flicker or whatever adjective there is to the music.  They seem to flash regardless but will flash "faster" if music is playing. I messed with sensitivity and it's not quite what I expected.  Also in the product image they're not as bright to light up the car as shown.  They're still bright just not as shown.  It's a great product and plan on doing the under carriage with them in the same color.

Very easy install in our (yet to be completed) 1973 Holiday Rambler Trav'ler.  It's surprisingly smaller than I expected, but very nicely matched with the roof unit. The control panel is a little bit difficult to open but works just fine in it's closed position. The remote control is a great plus, but it's so small (about the size of a credit card) that I'm sure it will get lost.

I like them. Perfect fit. Nice light output. Nice beam cut off. I installed them on a 1995 Chevy Blazer S-10. The H6545 light socket on the truck is a little tricky. Could not find an adapter to plug directly into the stock headlight sockets. Had to get a H4 adapter on one end and spade ends on the other to plug into the socket on the truck. I wanted to keep the original sockets on the truck in case i ever needed to reinstall the seal beam headlights. Very well made, quality glass lens. Very soft and snug rubber boot to keep out moisture. I Hope it stays soft for years to come. The light does shine farther down the road, that is what i was looking for. Since i am very happy with these new headlights i will be removing the stock factory H6545 socket/plug. These new lights will be staying on the truck. Going to install a heavy duty wire harness for better light output and reliability. Part number L07-008-AZA-1, Headlight Relay Wiring Harness H4/9003 With High Heat Ceramic Plugs Dual High Low Beam

Bought this to replace the old oiled k&n rf1041 filter on my 2004 Silverado. Fits good, and diameter is a perfect match. There is a lip on the inside of this filter that lets it only go on so far that the k&n didn't have (prob a design upgrade), but it seals tight, its a little longer which is nice, and no oil!

Fits nicely on the rear windshield of my 2002 Ford Ranger XLT. The plastic clips are a bit wobbly but held up well for a 2hr trip thru some rocky trails. It holds my shotguns, rifles and pellet rifles nicely. Could easily be used to hold bags or anything with straps when not carting around your long guns. Nothing heavy obviously. However the suction cups are very strong.. It will take some force to apply them to the window and you can't move once attached.

I chose Exide because BMW's original battery was (is) Exide.Battery arrived extremely well protected package. not air bubble or peanuts but firm honey cone cardboard (pic attached).Someone maybe wonder why dealer charge $200 or more labor for just 10 minutes work who buy this for BMW (Mini, Bentley and maybe MBZ too).Because BMW (and other European manufactures) car's equipped with IBS (Inteligent Battery Sensor) on battery terminal (pic attached)It monitor condition of Battery even it's ignition off and sleeping.and it send data to DCM and CAS (on board module), control amount of battery charging and vehicle electrical system consumption.So, vehicle needs to know if battery is new or 5 years old, how much capacity, AGM or conventional flood type.You have to re-register to CAS module even If replaced by same type same capacity battery.It can't be done by regular OBD error code reader (no matter if it's $30 equipment or $1000 equipment, regular OBD reader can't communicate with BMW control module)Resetting Clock, lost Bluetooth communication and/or lost address book are because battery was disconnected for few minutes, nothing related to re-register process.It could be happen to any vehicle made by any auto-manufactures.You can avoid that by connecting Jumper battery to Jump terminal on engine compartment (battery is in trunk but there is jump terminal in engine compartment)Connecting trickle charger or smart charger to jumper terminal don't work.Because trickle charger/smart charger are monitoring battery voltage. (Send power, then monitor battery voltage, send power trickle)when there is no voltage back from connection, trickle charger stop send power (stop charging)So, once you disconnect battery, trickle charger stop sending power.Be careful red wires are still hot and car is still wake when you change battery by connecting second battery (jumper battery).When you change BMW battery, ask dealer or local shop to battery register (update data on module).Otherwise, your BMW act as if it has 5 years old battery.My other car's Diehard battery died in less than 3 years.My BMW's Original Exide lasted more than 5 years.

When I took this out of the box, I was instantly thought it would be to large for my dashboard.  There are times I don't mind being wrong.  The Jhua rotating dual head fan doesn't take nearly as much room as I had expected.  Granted, I haven't been leaving it up there while I've been driving.  When I get the chance, I'm a lunchtime napper.  I don't like running the car to cool it down (gas is too expensive) and there's not many places I can park at work that offer a decent breeze.  Now it doesn't matter where I park, the dual fans keep a nice breeze blowing down.  The fans plug into a normal cigarette lighter or auxiliary power outlet, but it doesn't drain my battery enough to have caused any issues starting it after work.The fans have multiple power settings (Off-Low-High), with one knob to control them both.  Each fan unit is about 4 1/4" in diameter and they can be rotated both on both axis, allowing for any angle/position you'll probably need.  They've got a decent amount of power behind them too.  It had the hot air circulated out of the car fairly quick.  The base of the unit is a 8" x 4" rectangle and can be mounted to your dash with the supplied foam pieces (there is double sided tape on each side as well).  The foam pieces seem a little tall for my liking, but as I don't keep my fan there permanently, I may add some Velcro tabs, for extra stability.Please note, I was lucky enough to receive this product at a discount, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I do not feel that the cost of a product reflects it's usefulness and these are my thoughts and opinions on how useful it was for me.

I have used this product with each oil change in my Cadillac Northstar, which is notorious for oil usage. Right away the engine quieted down and it no loger goes through a quart of oil a month as it did before.  I will continue with LUBEGARD as long as I own the car. It works...buy it.

These seat covers were installed on a Honda CRV. Somewhat easy to install AFTER watching the helpful youtube instruction videos provided on the package.Advantages:-Protects original cloth seats from water, dirt, stains, etc.-Instructions also guide you to video instructions online.Disadvantages:-Cheap material. Leave the seat covers in a ventilated area so the nasty plastic chemical smell can dissipate before installing. I could barely breathe after opening the package.-Cheap material. The seams attaching the ribbons ripped off if I pulled too tightly. Mesh material tears easily. Should have velcro for the armrest rather than having to dissemble the armrests! Pockets on the back of the front bucket seats are also made of mesh. I think they will tear easily.Overall I spent almost two hours installing these seat covers. They look decent if you spend some time tucking material under the seat hardware. (See pictures)

Nothing sounds better than a Hemi with a Flowmaster exhaust! The sound is AWESOME and is much louder than the oem muffler that came with my Bighorn Ram, but not loud enough to get pulled over by the boys in blue. Its a bit pricey and you could easily buy a Flowmaster Super 44 and have a muffler shop install it for much cheaper than the $279 price tag... but I don't regret buying it.Installation is quick and easy only if you decide to cut off the factory muffler like I ended up doing. If you opt not to cut it off then you have to dismantle the entire system from the tailpipes to the factory muffler which will take a few hours if you're alone and  using simple hand tools.A muffler shop could install it quicker only because they have power tools and a lift which makes installation a breeze. If you're a DIYer like I am then time won't be an issue.

Fast and easy to use and it cleaned the wind shield well and made the water run off like Rain-X should.I have used regular Rain-X for as long as I can remember.  I just washed my car and rinsed it and dried it and the windshield was covered in water spots.  I am sick of Windex that doesn't work anymore so I went to the auto store to get several items and picked up a bottle of this.  I used two rags, one to wipe it on with and scrub and the second to dry and buff the window.  When I was done I couldn't believe the difference.  With  the effort the window was spotless.  When the window got wet a few days later it ran off like usual with Rain-X.It was easy to use and it cleaned better that the other window cleaners that I had been using.  I like this product and I rated it 5 stars.

for the money these are awesome.  I've used the method of two people measuring from similar spots on the tire edge to edge but that doesn't give the confidence this does.  This is easily a one man job.  You put the plates up flat against the tire/rim.  I lean one jack stand against it to keep it in place.  You extend a tape measure under the car and have it grasp on the magnet, swing it through the same slot on the opposite side and bam, you do some math.  I'm a bit angry i never purchased these earlier.  based on a recent alignment done at a professional shop I'm within 1/16 which to me is pretty close.

Direct fit on my 97 TJ Wrangler. Three wire lead spliced into factory harness, easy install and the quality seems more than adequate considering the costs compared to "Jeep" LED tail lights. These are universal so you have to punch the proper holes out the back of the housing to mount to the factory bolt holes. I reused the factory bolts to mount them, no isssues. Lastly, theses suckers are bright.... wasn't crazy about the incandescent bulbs for the reverse lights so I grabbed a pair of LED bulbs from local parts store and threw those in during the install. Again, DOES NOT COME WITH LED REVERSE LAMPS. Otherwise, very pleased.

I purchased these to mount on my Yamaha Super Tenere dual sport bike for added running light. It turns out it is too bright (it says off road use only on the listing) to use at night for a running light. The light is bright and "clean" with a clear lens. The aluminum housing is rugged and I anticipate a long operational life. I'm going to explore running it only when my high beams are on or put a resister inline for regular use and a relay to step it up to a full 12v when I trigger my high beams. The reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is that there mounting hardware is for a flat surface I'm attempting to mount on a smaller diameter tubular engine protection cage. I was able to mount them without a light mounting bar.

Top pipe is the Easy Wrap. Love the black that this has (opposed to Advance's grayer look).Looks great! I am not sure on how they will look over some sort of time frame, but they look awesome. I thought I would be good with a 1" 50 foot wrap - perhaps I under estimated my size on 05 Honda VTX 1300, or I just did a really tight wrap  - but that is my own fault.Smells a bit, as they all do, but looks fantastic. The ties that come with it are hard if you don't have more than your hands. I used screw-clamps from the tool store on mine, which gives it a little character either way.For $15, and prime shipping, these things are great! Ordered a second roll to do the lower pipe again, and these have given my recent used purchase a new look (and covered up the rusted pipes that previous owner brought on by leaving this bike outside).

This Lylla B-Light item provides a crisp white light at the push of a button,  The fact that it is battery powered makes it easy to install (no need to find a power source and run wire to the mounting area).  The light uses 3 AAA batteries (not included) the battery box as well as the light strip have 3m tape to stick to wherever you want to mount it.I mounted this light inside my truck bed that has a tonneau cover so I cant speak to the element resistance of the item but it seems well constructed for what it is.  My only wish was that it would be able to string more along or order a longer width to run more lights around my truck bed.The only con I ran into is that you do have to be careful when removing the sticky tape backing from the light strip.  When I first pulled to remove the paper backing I actually started to peel off the sticky part instead of just the paper backing.  I was able to push it back on the light strip and the rest of the install went fine.All in all I like the product.  Easy to install and easy to use.  Overall 4.5 stars /5.I received this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.

I was very hesitant with this product as the idea of using a rinse less wash had me worried about scratches. It worked great! I started off with 2 gallons of water with 1 oz of the product and had 6 medium sized microfiber towels folded into a square that left me 4 clean spots inside and out. And dried as I washed dragging the microfiber with no pressure other than the weight of the microfiber. I've also used it as a clay lube with my nanoskin sponge and it works amazingly well. I've also used it as a quick detailer to use to help get dry wax off and works great as well. The product is definitely a must have in every detailers arsenal. Hell I even throw 2 oz of it in my wash bucket when I do a regular two bucket method to add extra lubrication.

Best interior rack out right now, but worth waiting for next version or attempt. Rack is all black to include tubing which is not what was expected by the pics but was fine. Joints and locking points are all metal which means noisy. Tabs where hinge points are were already bent when I opened the box due to thin metal construction. Their website customer service didn't respond to my email questions either. Directions are useless, but installation can eventually be figured out by yourself. Warning, if you have a 2016-2017 jeep JK dual top where your soft top remains in while the hardtop is on will not allow the installation of this rack.

Always fun to see the smoke show. Be sure to let the car stand for 15 minutes after your pour the treatment into the brake booster line and before turning the car back on.

Good product but DO NOT use the instructions or Curt video if you are installing on a later model Jeep with the vacuum pump behind the bumper! I wasted 4 hours trying to get this on the way they show you which is impossible because you can't get or tighten the bolts on due do the vacuum pump blocking everything.After giving up, I decide to work from above instead of the way they show you from below the bumper.Take off the front grille (which is very easy as it's designed to come off as this is the way you change the headlight bulbs), then take off the plastic piece between the bumper and grille ( you might have trouble getting the plastic push rivets off, just drill through & get Pep Boys replacements for $3.00), then unbolt the vacuum pump ( leave hoses & wire connection on and just move out of the way slightly) and now you can reach all the bolts like a human being and torque them when done.This whole process took 20 - 30 minutes and then installing all 6 bolts took another 20 -30 minutes.Also get a longer bolt and carriage bolt for the drivers side before you start because they have to go through the frame as shown and the pump bracket as they don't tell you about. The pictures below shows their carriage bolt installed, you can see that it doesn't even go all the way through the bolt. Also you will have to drill out 1 opening on the vacuum pump bracket.Curt's instructions are totally useless and this plus having to buy additional hardware is why this only gets 3 stars from me.

This Product is Great for Propane Grill Drip Pans!Simply Place a 1/4-inch layer "Up To" a 3-millimeter layer(i.e. 3-millimeter is about the Thickness of 3 Creditor Debit Cards.) in the Bottom of the disposable drip pan;And change out Oil Dri Granules once a month;*Depending* on how often you use your Grill.IT ONLY Takes a THIN Layer of Oil-Dri Granules for aPropane Grill Drip Pan.*If you only Grill on the weekends change outgranules once a month; or more if you grill more often.I Think most people know; but I circled what I am referring to in the photo.

this is a pretty good light bar for the money.  wasn't the easiest install but hardly difficult.  I highly recommend taking off the tailgate.  it just gives you more room to work with.  also test the light bar before you install so you don't go through the installation process for nothing.  I used a inline adapter to connect this underneath my truck. This adapter sadly cost more than the light bar.  sticking it out of the 4 pin connector on the bumper looks pretty crappy to me.  But if its simplicity you want,  well, be my guest.  If you want the reverse lights to work,  you will have to wire the white wire into either one of your reverse lights,  or into the wiring harness on your truck.  i wired my reverse into the reverse on the inline adapter i bought.  that way none of my factory wires were "tampered"  with should i have a dealership issue. lol  Mounting was pretty straight forward.  i ended up cutting 2 pieces of wood to make sure i got the led light level.  It is not stiff enough to keep itself straight.  it comes coiled up in a package.  keeping it straight to attach the 3m adhesive to the truck was quite a challenge.  hence the wood pieces to use as a guideline.  If you have a ram.  to get the light in the best possible spot.  you will have to remove a grommet that protects the edges of the spare tire access hole.  its still accessible, but be careful using it, as the light bar will cover it a bit.  also i bought the 60" for my 2014 ram 1500.  while it fits fine and looks good.  a few inches off would have been better.  The ram has some panel lines the light bar has to bend over on the ends.  this causes a small gap on each end to where the 3m tape is not making contact with the metal.  I put some clear caulk in the gaps as well as all along the top and ends.  This however did not stop some water from somehow getting into the bar.  after going through an automatic car wash,  i noticed a small amount of condensation, on the drivers side.  it has since dissipated.  We have had very heavy rain the last couple of days.  no issues with that.  just seems to be high powered sprays directly at the light bar.  i suspect that it isn't completely air tight between the black plastic base and the clear housing for the leds.  Im gonna put more clear caulk over the whole thing to be on the safe side.  as for functionality it works great.  leds are nice and brights. easily seen during the day, but nighttime, obviously is where it shines.  ive got tons of compliments.

Been using daily as a glow plug switch through a relay. I tied the light to the output of the relay. One day the light didn't come on despite pushing the button, letting me know my relay had failed, meaning it works as designed. Very positive 'push' action, bright LED ring... Easy install.

This kit is absolute trash. Says 120 min install. I am skilled and it took 15 hours. The template is generic and wrong (I used AEV template and it was wrong as well so the other reviews are incorrect). The intake part is slanted do you can not make a template, two of us, very skilled at mechanical work and modifications did the best we could and the hole was way off. Not only that but due to the slanted intake instead of a round hole it's massive and oval, leaving a gap at the front at least 1/2". I did a slow grind and it barely fit while giving a massive gap.The material of the snorkel is actually good. Nice thick and sturdy. The bracket was solid and had a thick powdercoat. The screws were trash. One broke and it wasn't even tight. It broke off inside the snorkel so I had to drill it out and manufactur another screw. The rivets were trash. Had one not work at all and another left a nice amount on the front so the snorkel didn't go flush which caused the bolts holes not to line up. I ended up grinding that rivet down. The hose was decent, nice rubber ends that sealed well with each end. The metal clamps were okay, no issues with them. The snorkel head was nice and sturdy and looks to be set at a good angle.One more thought. Other reviews say the door can be removed. I mounted this as far forward as I could (the nasty catch to this one is the antenna recess is specific, it only fits if perfectly aligned) and I am certain I will not ge able to take my doors off. I hope I can tweak it with removal of the two windshield bolts enough to get the doors off. But what a pain, and if that won't work. I am stuck cause I am not undoing the snorkel which I prob couldn't do even if I wanted too.The top mount bolt is under the battery tray so it can not be reached in any other manner than from the top. You WILL need to remove the battery and tray. I tried to avoid this but ultimately, it would have been much safer if I had. You also will have to relocate a vacuum box AND cut your fender support bracket with a sawzaw significantly (enough I am concerned I compromised the rigidity of the bracket) just to get the hose through it.No directions but for the most part obvious. However, if I had to do it over I would save funds and buy name brand. This was absolutely not worth it. My jeep is permanently damaged at every point where this connects to the jeep. I will not ever remove my snorkel, but the point is, I couldn't if I wanted to. Not without it looking horrible. I would have to replace the fender and the inner bracket, plus repair the riveted holes in the windshield frame and that's only if I could get the rivets out (which I am sure u can't without drilling them out with an even bigger bit)I am not easily frustrated but this has my eye twitching, my cheek twitching, I am stressed, sore, and disappointed. I tore my jeep up. This thing better work. I am testing it this week, I will report back with an updated review.If you are on the fence because of the reviews. Trust me, don't do it. You can make your own cowl snorkel for less and much less work. I was doing that then thought this would be easier Need less stressful lol. It's so pathetic I can't help but laugh.Pro: it does look pretty good. Other than the gap at the base :-/.Update a year later: I have tested this thing very well. Actually sank over my hood crossing a deep river crossing and didn't have any trouble at all. I did add a prefilter to my air filter just in case but it was not needed. A year later and it's still good to go. One thing, I actually do have to remove two screws and pull it away from the vehicle to get the door off or on. That's hard to do while holding the door up. Especially when putting it back on. Tempted to cut the upper hinge bolt to make it easier. Even melted and pushed in the snorkle right there but it just wasn't enough, in hindsight, an extra $50 for name brand and paying a shop $50 to install would have been far better than the 15+ hours I spent on it.

UPDATE: I've had this for a couple months now. It's gone through a tropical storm and the carwash, no water in the housing. Bumping to 5.The light bar itself is great, it is really bright, like, really. I was surprised as we're the neighbors. It would have been nice to have some directions with it and even better if it worked better with the Jeep Wrangler mounting brackets by the same company, but hey, I worked it out

Heel fell off after only 8 wears.  I have contacted customer service and I can tell they are not from Milwaukee Wisconsin as I had thought.  Boot is made in china and poorly glued on.  Fell off at a restaurant while I was eating after wearing these boots only 5 to 8 times.  Tried to write a review on their website, but it did not let me.  Really disappointed.  I really liked the boots until the heel fell off.

Finally just installed these.First, the blue "snap-connectors" are a pain.  Just cut the power wire and splice all three white wires (1 Jeep power wire, 2 LED wires) together and screw a sheet metal screw in the interior steel panel for the ground.  Sounds difficult but it really only takes two seconds.Second, the instructions are vague and don't accurately represent the install necessary. Pretty easy to install overall though.Third, the LED's themselves fit snugly in my aftermarket wheel.  I didn't use the plastic washers.  I just let the wires get pressed between the tire carrier and the wheel a bit.  It holds the LEDs in place well this way. Some people say it gets "pinched" but there is enough metal and flat surface there that I don't believe it will cut the wires.  Time will tell though and I may be wrong and blow a fuse down the road :)Fourth and most importantly, They are not made for an aftermarket rear bumper/tire swing.  The wire loom is WAY too short for it to be run cleanly and you will need to route it through some tight areas and zip tie it as you go. I plan on splicing in some extensions to make it long enough to run inside the tail gate and out along the swing arm.  As it is now it is just a piece of wire loom hanging loosely between the tail gate and the swing arm.  You have to open the swing arm a little ways then open the tail gate to keep it from pulling the wires.  Others have run into this issue as well.However, they do look great and are very bright. 4 stars because of the poor instructions and lack of wire length.Good Luck and HAPPY JEEPING!!!

This works nicely on my 08 Yukon Denali. I did have to cut a hole for the center dash speaker. Perhaps there is a cover with this hole already? Meh, it was easy. It fits nicely and looks clean though I did cut off the manufacturers tag. Look at my photo, 95F! That was a cool day. No wonder my dash cracked. At least I don't see the cracks anymore! ;-)

I have a 2500 lb home built travel trailer. Tongue load is 360 lbs. I've towed it a great deal with generation 2 tacomas with no problem. But on my new 2016 I was getting a huge amount of porpoising / up and down bouncing. Once it would get started it would bounce the rear end up and down for some distance. Made it very uncomfortable to drive, and somewhat uncontrollable. It was clear that the factory off road shocks, which are very soft, we're not designed for towing - even though the truck has the towing package and is rated to tow 6400 lbs. I've towed trailers for years, so I know all about loading and tongue load. Tongue load should be 10 to 15 % of trailer load at all times. The trailer is balanced correctly. Anyway after reading the Tacoma forums and finding many others having same trouble when towing a travel trailer with the new Tacoma I decided to give these a try in the rear. Many people on the forums said these shocks solved the problem. Easy installation. Lower bolt torque is 75ft lbs. top bolt is 15 ft lbs. The truck unloaded rides wonderfully. Maybe a little stiffer than before. But still a good ride.  Even on dirt road still same quality ride as oem shocks. But as soon as I headed out with the trailer the difference was amazing!!!  Where the back end of the truck would start bouncing and continue to bounce, now it's smooth as can be. This shock is a 2 inch shock. The factory off road shocks are a 1.5 inch shock. After towing for a while the factory shocks would be hot to the touch which makes sense that they just could not dampen the bounce. These new shocks are a 2 inch shock. They fit no problem. Just out a little soap on the runner ends to ease getting them in to the brackets at the bottom. What a difference. Thankfully. I was beginning to wonder if I was going to have to engage Toyota in the problem. But $150 for a solution is reasonable. I'll put them on the front eventually. That's harder since the shocks are inside the coil springs. For now having them on the rear works great.

I needed 2 of these for a very tight fitting area and while the box says they are both 2 1/2", the actual measurement is 3"... Even if I 'Squeeze' the ends in, the clamp will have to be drilled out to become the 2 1/2" that I need.  Now I have some additional work to do and this was supposed to save me time and effort.

I recently put this kit on my 2013 Rubicon 4-Door. I wanted a conservative lift, but still gain distance between the skid-plates and boulders. This helped me achieve that. This also allowed me to go up in tire size. I went from the stock 32" x 10" tires to 33" x 11.5" to get my "pumpkins" a little higher too. I wanted to reuse the stock 17" wheels so I added 1.5" spacers. I drive my Rubi to work every day. I'm now a little higher and wider without sacrificing handling and safety. Off to the Rubicon Trail in 3 weeks!

So I bought a bike rack for the back of the car, I wanted to be able to transport a couple of bicycles for me, and my girl to go out and ride some trails. Since I have a sedan, stuffing the bikes in the back seat isn't an option, I also didn't want a rack that straps to the trunk, they just don't look as sturdy as a hitch mount, and since I have a hitch, I thought that would be the way to go. However not with this rack! First problem was that the part that goes into the hitch, I'll call the lower portion, required it to be inserted too far to secure it. So I drilled new holes in my hitch to accommodate the lower portion, otherwise it was too close to bumper, and wouldn't work. I only used it 3 times, the first time I used it the bolt that came with it stripped the treads. So I replaced the bolt, and used it another time, at this point it seemed like my problem was solved, the bolt was still very tight. I figured that was intentional so it wouldn't back out during use. Third time I used it; the threads were so tight that I literally snapped the bolt off trying to remove it from the hitch. Now I have to drill the remainder of the bolt out, and ruin the bottom portion in the process. I guess I should just pony up the $150 or so for a proper rack. This one is quite literally garbage now.

The anode came packaged in a brown plastic bag with a photocopied label stapled to it.  Inside the bag was a business card indicating this is from RotoMetals, not Flex-a-lite.  Furthermore every picture of a Flex-a-lite part on-line has the anode stamped with the letters "O-A".  This one has no such stamp.To be perfectly clear....  It is a sacrificial anode.  It is not some highly complex device.  I expect this will perform the job just fine.  It simply does not appear to be the name brand part it is advertised to be.

This was a exact fit for a 2009 Subaru Legacy Limited. Its less then HALF the price of a OEM. Subaru wanted $160 EACH! This is a very simple repair to do and there is a lot of videos online to show you how to do it. There is no need to pay a shop $400-$600 to do this, all you need is $80 and an hour of your time. If your not sure how to do it use youtube and it will only take you 2 hours MAX!!!

I've use these racks to carry my bmx bike, fixie, and mtb. It carries them without a problem, except for the first highroller I got from Amazon was faulty, it had a crooked rail body and the red knob broke free, so as it still thightens down/works, it does not keep in place.I emailed Yakima directly and they quickly sent me a new highroller free of charage. I guess some people just have bad luck or deal with the wrong people.My HighRoller's never had one problem in the wind or long drives.  It does weight more then other racks but it feels and looks strong/heavy duty. Added with corelocks I feel really comfterable and safe with them on.

fairing isn't a true black, more of a really dark grey / cloudy black. unfortunately, I could also tell the one I received was used because it had small rust / indentation rings on the fairing mount where someone had tightened the washers when mounting the hardware to their bike. I had this faring on my bike already but had opted to purchase a 2nd one a year and a half later because the mounting hardware had cracked over time due to vibration / jolts while riding my Harley. this is a decent product for the price but it will wear down so I'm going to try a more expensive, nicer fairing with a sturdier bracket instead. refund was requested and the seller said they would only provide a 10% refund so a claim was filed shortly after

I looked at several versions of these, trying to find the 'right' deal. Didn't look to closely at the provided hardware, but probably still wouldn't have figured out that it was designed to quickly slip in and out of the attachments that are provided. Major bonus. I figured I would have to bolt and unbolt it each time I folded up the trailer, but this slips out in an instant and is dead solid when the bike is strapped down in it.Great design and materials bent just right for a dirt bike tire, and with the slip fit install it's even better!

I welded it to a piece of 1/2 flat plate to bolt to my trailer. Good solid piece of steel but the curt coupler I bought with it was a lil sloppy side to side in the channel. Being that these 2 products go together they should fit snug in my eyes.... That's the only reason I dropped to 4 stars instead of 5. Seems like a good setup. We'll see when I pull a full trailer.

Big fan of these LED units.  Granted the are not DOT approved for use, they do work much better than many other brands.  I am very satisfied with these over the course of time I have had them installed.  Heat is not an issue as of yet, and the light output is much cleaner than the stock incandescent lamp.Four stars based not on performance but on cost.  Also, wish they could be DOT approved, but not a factor I really am concerned about.Installed for longer than a month, very pleased.  Attached photos show the Putco LED on the left, and stock incandescent on the right.  One picture is running light, other is caught with emergency flashers.  Putco LED out performs the stock incandescent during direct daylight situations.I have tried many other LED options and the Putco wins hands down!Installed in 2000 Nissan Pathfinder.

Good value.  A great replacement for the original vent.  The bottom trim requires a thicker roof for the installation.  I made a trim out of PVC board and then installed the trim that came with the vent.  The kit does NOT include any of the screws, be sure to safe the old ones or buy them before you start the installation.

The case is ok, but I would spend a few extra dollars and get this one (http://amzn.com/B00NF2J6ZK). Getting the case apart and the phone in it is a bit of a hassle because of the weird way it is made together. The port covers are more of a nuisance than helpful. The clear plastic cover that goes over the fingerprint sensor is too thin and wrinkles easy. This causes it to give false readings when trying to unlock the device. This case has a lot of potential, but it is just not quite there yet. Within a day, I had already peeled off the cover over the home button and am thinking about doing that to the screen protector as well.

Fits perfectly. Price was awesome. I can't see paying a lot of money for such a simple item that performs exactly the same. Looks good under the hood. Haven't driven it yet. She's in the garage till spring....

Just got these in 3 days after I ordered them. Finally got a chance to put them on today. It was my first time installing wheel spacers but my buddy put some little 25mm on his soob so he helped me out. We banged it out in about an hour and fifteen minutes. Fifteen of those minutes were spent searching for a lug we lost. We have an auto hobby shop on base with a lift and compressed air so install was very quick. Drove 15 miles home and the wheels are still on! Going to check my torque again in a few days. One note, the included instructions, SUCK! Gave my 2010 Jeep liberty a much beefier stance! Highly recommended!One note, the included instructions, SUCK! Stick to these simple tips.1)When you get your wheel off clean your wheel hub off really got with lots of brake clean or soapy water and a new wire brush. You'll want the smoothest mating surface possible.2) Wipe it down and apply a thin coat of anti-seize and spread it with a rag all over the hub being careful not to get any on the threads.3) Put Spacers on and start tightening in a star patter until you start feeling resistance.4) Grab your torque wrench set to whatever setting your tires are supposed to be mounted at and tighten in a star pattern. Those lugs on the threads will ensure the spacer centers on your hub. Note: When Twerking have a buddy press on the brake to keep the hub steady.5) wipe away excess anti-seize and put your wheels back on, torque down lugs same as before6) Step back and enjoy the look!7) Take your wheels off after 25 miles and re-check that your lugs are still on around your torque spec

Love it! Easy install only thing is I might paint my grill behind it black to make it less noticeable. Sometimes in the light you can see the grill behind it. But for the money it's great already have got lots of comments

Great quality boot.Not much to say except that when I purchased it I didn't see the size info at the bottom of the page (2 5/8 in. OD x 1 1/8 in.)... It was no good for my application and was returned.However, I did post some pictures against a ruler to help you figure out if it will fit your application.  See customer images.

Purchased for cosplay purposes. Needed to strengthen a cardboard Batgirl cowl/mask. I covered the cardboard in resin and then went over it with this. I've never used bondo before so it was a interested learning process. Don't mix a lot all at once. It will harden quickly if you're not fast enough. I used some clay tools to mix and spread it on. It probably would have worked better if it wasn't such oddly shaped piece to work with.This was slightly cheaper on Amazon than my local Walmart.It was a pain for my to use for this purpose. It also smells to horrible even with a respirator on, I had to change my clothes and shower afterwards.Next time I'm just going to go with papermache lol.If you found this review helpful, please click yes. This helps me a lot as a reviewer.

I unnecessarily prepared by purchasing additional wire, and and some other odds and ends. I actually didn't have to add and wire to the harness. I removed some because I had extra. The only thing this kit needs to make it perfect is this (Bussmann Add-A -Circuit)  to get power to the switch. It's only $5.99 at any auto parts store though.The kit doesn't come with the connectors that need to be hooked up to the lights them selves, but just clipping of the ones on the harness and soldering or using butt connectors works just fine.

This is the first set of Taylor wires I have ever installed, and I can see what all the fuss has been about ofer the years. I am now a Taylor man. Great fit great color selection (ford blue in my case), terrific performance, and easier startups.And to answer the review from Teresa below, that "weird" blue matches the factory blue on the 289 in my '65 Galaxie quite nicely. That being said, the later yr fords from '69 and later are a darker shade. Also you shouldn't expect a factory loom designed for a 7mm wire to easily accommodate a wire that is 1mm larger.If you go in with these expectations, you should be happy with these wires.

These LED H11 yellow lights are great and it's just "plug and play" no additional wiring. They are bright.

I've had one installed under the hood of my JK for about a year. It doesn't get much use but today I noted that several of the LED's are not working. It's difficult to see in the picture because the light is very bright, but I'm not too impressed with the longevity.

I order a set of WeatherTech floor liners for every vehicle I purchase. This is the 3rd set I've ordered and they are still just as great as ever. The liners cover the entire carpet and keep it fresh and protected. When they arrived I just placed them out in the sun for a little while so they would flatten out after being folded up to fit in the product box. After about an hour they are good to go. I always recommend these to friends and family when they purchase new vehicles and I've heard nothing but good things from them as well once they get them. I have pictures attached of before and after installing in my 2017 Silverado crew cab.

I recently purchased a pre-owned '04 Wrangler. I love it! However, the details on it were really starting to bother me. The previous owner had installed chrome climate control knobs and chrome entry guards and, personally, I really hate chrome on my Jeep. I purchased three of these and they were the perfect solution. These OEM-looking knobs look SO much better! They turn much more smoothly and feel more comfortable and ergonomic than the chrome knobs. Thanks Rugged Ridge! Love the product. Would recommend to my fellow Jeepers.It's a Jeep thing.

I was some what skeptical on this. The price seems to low for how bright people were saying they really were! BUT HOLY CRAP! I installed them in my 2000 Ford F-150 with ease. No fitment issues.. And the difference is super clear! If you want more light while backing up... GET THESE! Cant speak for how long they will last as I just now installed them. But you will be WOW'D

A good replacement for a Jeep Wrangler TJ antenna.-Was easy to install and made sure that blue LockTite was used in the factory post as Chrysler did use that when they built the Jeep in 2003.-Was able to get local Christian radio stations and a few others - just like the factory 31" antenna.-A snazzy looking antenna that compliments the appearance of any Jeep.NOTE: The package does say remove when going through a car wash ~ be sure to have a 13mm wrench to remove it, as the package says, so this antenna doesn't get destroyed.Keep the older factory antenna (10mm wrench) in the vehicle if the antenna gets vandalized, mangled on a Jeep trail run or an "oops" life episode.

This odd 2-piece cabin filter feels very high quality, and it is the OE filter. The charcoal works well in keeping out odors and freshening the air inside the car.

PLEASE READ UPDATE!I thought this was going to be black with white text but I got Black with the white parts just cut out.  I was going to put this on my tinted window but it being all black I did not know if I would be able to use it.  Some said it looks cool on the tinted window, I tried it out and wow, I really like it, it has a nice stealthy but visible look to it. It has that stealth flat black color.  I am really happy with it, will be getting another for the other side.UPDATE. So I liked the way the first one looked, I ordered another for the other side of the truck, ordered from same amazon page but it was shipped by a different seller.  The first one I got was Matt Black, and looks great on the tinted glass, but the second one I received is Glossy Black and does not look as good on the glass.  There is no mention on the product description that I remember matt vs gloss being stated.  I would really prefer the Matt black but not sure how to go about making sure I get that version.  It seems to be kind of a crapshoot on which you will get.

This thing is a piece of crap! They only last a few months before they burn themselves out. Most people won't even notice until they hook a watt meter up to the oil pan heater and realize it isn't drawing any electricity. This is why it has good reviews - it works OK at first, but a few months later it does not! I'm on my third one now and it's broken again - will be sending back to Amazon. This one burned right through where the cord attaches, not only is it junk it's a fire hazard!Most Kats products are very poor quality. Please choose any other brand of the same thing - they often cost less and are of a higher quality! Kats doesn't even bother to answer their customer service/support email, and not a chance you will be able to make a claim on the warranty it supposedly comes with.(And no, I did not install it wrong, it has been installed exactly as the directions describe with RTV sealant around all the edges and no bubbles!)

Direct replacement for the battery taken out of my 2000 Yamaha Big Bear 400. This model has higher cranking amps that the original non-H version, but otherwise the identical. Followed instructions to the T for filling, soaking and charging. Very easy to do. If I ever need another battery for any of my other small engine equipment I'll go with Yuasa if available.

The good: It fit my girlfriend's 2011 Camry. I was able to use it to replace the oil filter.The bad: Unfortunately, the jackwagon who last changed the oil filter tightened it *way* too tight and I completely stripped the 3/8 interior of the oil filter wrench trying to remove it (see pic).I was still able to use it after a trip to the local auto parts store to buy a 1 1/16" box-end wrench (additional $15).I returned this item.

This fits my 2005 Lexus ES really well.  Glad I took the time to look up the length, fitted ends (like a sheet) tuck around the bumpers and covers about half the tires.  Need to protect this car from debris as it's going to be parked for a season near a few tall Oaks that make a mess in the fall.  There is a single grommet on each side and a cord that you can use to tie the middle together (see the picture).  Seems solid and thick enough for my needs.  I like the zipper by the drivers door in the event we need to get in there.  The sides would be short on a taller car/SUV.

I got the short end of the 3600k color blue package, instead of the Xenon 4000k white package version. Installed one bulb, and they are just a teeny bit whiter than the stock yellow bulb, you have to really really look to tell it's a tad bit whiter. YIkes! Also, 150 hours life is a few months for me. If you have the headlights on for even 1 hour per day on average, it would be about 5 months before these bulbs goes out. NOT worth it! Stay away, or perhaps buy from the auction site that starts with an 'E', or go LED and have 30,000+ hours of life on a bulb(s).UPDATE: Returned these and got some plug and play LEDs for about the same cost as these bulbs, that's as easy as installing these Halogen bulbs. NOW I have PURE WHITE XENON headlights (see pic), and a WHOPPING 30,000 hours of LED bulb life per bulb. BEST DECISION I've made for 2018.

******************UPDATED REVIEW***********************************THIS SET OF LIGHTS IS GARBAGE! ANDthe company will not honor the warranty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I had this set of lights in my car for just under two weeks, when surprise! I was pulled over and cited for having a tail light out. I explained I had just replaced them both with brand new LED lights, but.. heres your ticket maam!I came home and opened up the rear tail light cover to discover BOTH lights were broken, one was non-functioning, the other broken but it still lit up (But not nearly as bright as it was when installed). I sent photos of the lights to Flashwolves, I mean it DOES say ONE YEAR WARRANTY right? Ha! They told me the damage looked like it was from shipping, so I was to contact Amazon, THEY can cover it. Then they pointed out I received my lights on a promotion. Yes, yes I did! I pointed out: regardless how they were paid for, they are under warranty! And received no more replies. So, not only are the lights complete CRAP that melted after two weeks of light use (I barely drive my car!) they are not a company who stands behind their product OR fulfills the warranty. I would stay away from this product and company. When your lights melt and malfunction (and you get a ticket for no tail lights) this company will not help you!!***************************************************************************************************I installed LED lights in one of my cars and liked it so much I wanted to put them in all my cars. Most of our cars are older, high mileage vehicles, not new cars. This set worked, yes, but they don't seem as bright as my set in the other car!I did not realize there were differences in these lights from brand to brand. I guess some have more of the tiny LEDs than others, and this set either has fewer or they're less bright than the other set. This set advertises a light on the end of the bulb in addition to the sides and the other one only has LEDs on the sides maybe the light is dispersed more evenly on these and that makes them appear less bright? But even if that is the case, I prefer the brighter appearing set of lights over these. I need bright light to see where I am backing up!!These lights do seem brighter than the OEM bulbs I had installed. They were your typical incandescent type of automotive bulbs. This set has a brighter white color especially, so if not brighter in power, the color is more clear white and not that yellowy incandescent color. Just for that fact makes them better than what I have.For the price, these are slightly higher cost than premium incandescent automotive bulbs. BUT youll get a brighter, whiter color from these! I am glad I changed mine, I just wish they were as bright as my other set. (Looking back, those did cost significantly more money) so, I AM happy with these bulbs. Just maybe check into the style and number of LEDs you want.I purchased this set of  FlashWolves (Pack of 2) Ultra Bright 3056 3156 3057 3157 4157 CREE R5 LED Bulbs with Projector LED Replacement Brake&Tail Light Bulb Xenon White 6000K at no cost to myself in exchange for my unbiased opinion and review. I have no affiliation to this company and receive no financial gain. I only leave positive reviews for items that meet or exceed my expectations.
I Love to Review...

Excellent hood latch, which completely eliminated hood flutter, but looks great! Very stout look and great quality. Don't let the installation intimidate you. It's a tight fit getting the back nuts off the lower hinge, but removing the grille (very easy to do) and using a small wrench makes it simply. Just take your time so you don't drop the nut down inside your fender.

Yes are amazing. Best money I've ever spent. Best bang for your buck. These 5100 are night and day over stock or a puck lift (coil spacer).I threw my 3 inch puck lift in the trash after I installed this. Put on max 2.5 setting and it rides like a dream. Excellent handling, tight turning, and very smooth. Easy to install with a coil compressor or have a shop do it for $50. My tip from the best ride staying in assignment spec and look good is get your 1 inch diff drop spacer (on Amazon for $30) and a 2 inch add a leaf for the rear and it gave me on overall lift height of 3.25 inches. You WILL NO REGRET THIS PURCHASE!  5100s are bad @$$. Btw my truck is a 2015 4X4 SR5 Access cab Tacoma.

I have been looking for one like this for a while and i found it HERE at a GREAT PRICE and you won't be paying $70-$80 for the same product . I installed it on my 1995 Harley Heritage and it looks & works excellent . Also bought a USB Charger that i plug instead of lighter to charge cell phone & Action Camera . Installation was done in about 30 minutes and wires provided are plenty long enough with plug ,fuse and terminals to battery ready to install . If you have a problem with lighter not getting hot enough disconnect the plug or negative on the battery and adjust the two wings in the main body slightly and this will make better contact and hold the lighter in place . I highly recommend this product you will be happy with this product !...:)

I LOVE these floor liners and I just got them. They fit absolutely perfectly in my 2011 Nissan Murano (look at user photos for evidence!). They are a bit slicker than carpet of course, but easy to clean (soap and water - instructions say not to use Armor All, etc). I did plug in my car model thru Amazon to check compatibility, but it said they weren't compatible - but went to WeatherTech's website and it suggested this same model number. When the product arrived, the inside sticker said it fits Murano 2009+. Amazon's price was WAY better - especially with the WeatherTech promotion thru 12/31, so if you buy two items, you save another $15 - perfect for my desire for front & rear liners. Also, the WeatherTech logo shown peeled right off for me after they baked in the TX heat a bit; a hairdryer may heat them enough to peel it off too if you don't like them.

Long enough to go all the way through my radiator support, and poke out about an inch after tightening down. Looks perfect on my 98 Mustang.Buy the lanyards that are a suggested item from Amazon with these. They work perfectly with the design, and will stop you from losing the pins when you're working on your car.

Seemed like they would've been a good buy and product. Shipping was good and fast. In a nice box with hardware included. Unfortunately 1 of the lights went dim after about 15 minutes of use. If not for that, these would deserve a lot better than a 3 star.***Update***  Somehow I received a replacement light for the one that had quit. ???  I didn't contact anyone about it, just wrote the review. So, that was awesome! Thank you!!! Was able to complete the install with all 6 on the Jeep and made a world of difference. Changed from a 3 to a 5 star. Been running them for a while now and zero issues.

Being frustrated with that, yes I am picky, I went on the hunt and found this product from Abrams here on Amazon. Being that it was only about $20 more than the light bar I was barely tolerating I did some research and decided to give it a try, I am so very glad that I did!While the ThunderEye 48 from Abrams clocked in at only 264 watts it made it no less visible, in fact with the wider selection of flash patterns it makes it MORE visible. The fit and finish of the light bar was also far superior, the design was well thought out in build, functionality and looks (did I say nice low profile?). Not even a day after changing out the not quite a year old light bar for this one I received comments from people I did not even know wanting to know where I got it and that it looked really good on the truck (never got that with the last one).The controller that comes with the light bar is a bit old school compared to some of the more advanced ones on the market today, but there is the very important fact that it is INCLUDED. With the real-time display on the controller there is no more guessing what pattern the light bar is running or getting out of the vehicle to check, this is a major bonus. If you decide that the controller is too big for your needs you're in luck, the cable to the light bar also has a pigtail that contains the wiring that is compatible with any other industry standard light bar controller that you may choose to use with it (all signal wires are 12V+ inputs that are constant or momentary).So it looks good, was a breeze to install and functions as advertised. Now it was time to test the one thing that I really hated about the other light bar, withstanding the elements. I did this by crossing two mountain passes twice in some particularly nasty weather figuring that if anything was going to drive water into it a rainstorm at 70, road grit from all the sand they put down and the wide swings in altitude and temperature variance (60F during the day and below freezing after sunset) would show me if there were any problems. NOT ONE!During the three day trip I got plenty of comments on the new truck and its setup being very professional looking as well as lots of looks that told me that at least a couple of other chase crews were envying the big flashy thing on the roof. We had absolutely NO problems with traffic seeing us parked in odd places on the highway waiting for our pilots and balloons to catch up so we could make the next leapfrog move trying to anticipate their flight path and where to pick them up.Returning home after a long weekend (and crossing the passes in bad weather again), pressure washing all the grime off the truck (including the light bar), I gave the light bar a close inspection. No water infiltration (fogging), and 100% functionality was retained. It was well worth every penny spent.When you take the price point out of the equation this light bar functions and is built just as well as all the others out there that cost four plus times the price (and you have to buy a separate controller with most of the more expensive ones).From what I have seen so far, it is my experience and opinion that this is a very solid product that you just cant beat the price point on when it comes to the quality you are getting. I am more than confident in referring others in the ballooning community to Abrams products for their warning signal needs.Pros:The Price Point, A+Function and BrightnessTight Fit and Finish - No Water Infiltration!A big selection of flash patterns that are displayed on the controller real timeCompatibility with industry standard controllers (Feneix, etc.)The manufacturer is VERY responsive to all questions and feedback on the productCons:Controller is Big, and has no backlighting or lighted switches (but hey, it was included)Traffic Advisor function should use six pods instead of four for increased visibility / communication to other motoristsPadding on mounting brackets is sparse when it comes to paint protection of the vehicle (I added additional material to protect the paint, brackets worked universally for mounting as advertised)NOTE: I did contact the manufacturer regarding the items listed in the Cons section above. As a result a new, smaller, controller is going to be offered in the near future. The deficiency with the Traffic Adviser is also going to be addressed by changing the programming to use six pods instead of the current four, and the issue with insufficient padding on the feet is also going to be addressed immediately.

didnt take a picture of the back seat. i hate how wrinkled they look i prefer cloth covers but my girlfriend has pets and getting the fur off cloth covers is ** impossible. the back seat covers fit alit big on my 2015 honda civic coupe looks more wrinkled than the front. the head rest covers don't fully cover the front passenger seats (they rise from the back side) but u won't notice that unless u sitting in the back it covered the back seat head rests just fine.. 2 of the head rests had a small scratch im guessing from being compressed so tightly. over all it does the job protects your seat and doesnt look too crappy alot of people liked them on my car i would suggested it if getting cloth isn't an option and if u don't mind the wrinkled look btw i spend my time putting them on stretched as far as i could this is the best i got them to look

I used these on my boat to get water skis up out if the way.  Mounted to my downrigger rails.  Dedicated ski mounts are so much more expensive I figured I would try this.  It seems to work great.  I don't know about longivity or reliability - I will follow up after some time.  But even if these break every now and then - I can replace them many times and still be cheaper than the highear robbery for marine equipment...

I put this on my 2003 Toyota Tacoma regular cab shell. I did have to cut off about 8 inches off the bars which wasn't terrible at all with a reciprocating saw. Also had to go to home cheapo for longer bolts, but that's all to be expected when you buy a universal roof rack. My shell was slightly curved and I contacted the seller and they sent some angled gasket material which worked Great! The build and quality of the racks and brackets are top notch. Be sure to use silicone on final install.

This review is being written 8/6/2013 for the Ken-Tool 35656 4 Way Professional Lug Wrench sold and shipped by Amazon on their website.I was looking for a very strong lug wrench for emergency usage on the road.  Typical lug wrenches are made in China and have a weld that holds the two cross pieces in place.  During usage, this weld is stressed and may break.  This renders the tool useless, but more importantly to me, may injure the person using it.  Casual web surfing for these lug wrenches show examples of failures of this kind.  The Ken-Tools lug wrench eliminates this weak point by the forged instead of welded construction.This is not a "pretty" tool in that it has a rather rough painted finish that arrived with some scratches and blemishes.  Others have noted that the tool needs to be wiped down initially to remove dirt and paint dust.  This is true.It would be a plus if the ends were etched with the sizes.  However, for a typical consumer use, the tool is kept in the vehicle and only one size is normally used.  Mark this end with a piece of tape and the identification problem is solved.Also true is that this is a heavy weight socket end, not a "thinwall" socket.  This may not fit inside some recessed alloy wheels.I've added pictures that show the build quality, forged construction, diameter of all four ends, and the paint/dirt residue.This is the tool that may save me along the road some day.  Even if you don't change your own tires, I recommend keeping one of these in your vehicle for emergency purposes.

Installation took 15 minutes, and following the directions resulted in a perfect installation. For those who experience the  power window automatically retracting it can be caused by the end tabs not being placed between the door frame and the window gasket. Only the top edge should be in the window gasket channel. This AVS product is reliable and sturdy in the Texas sun.

These bulbs(Philips 30mm festoon X-tremeVision LED) are a perfect fit for my 2010 Mazda CX-7The 30mm is the one that fits the CX-7 i bought the other two sizes first and both were too big so 30mm ended up being the right sizeThey really are extremely bright and immediately feels like a significant upgrade from the stock bulbs. These are bright enough that you can actually see the floor.On the CX-7 this fit on the interior lights above the back seats(dome i think they're called) and the one that comes on  when you open the trunk.The front lights(map lights?) uses a different bulb

This windshield looks great and works well with my Harley Davidson 48 Sportster 2016! Easy install, but definitely need the extra hand to hold everything in place while doing so. A great product and I definitely recommend it to those who want an easy adjustable and removable windshield.

Well it took me forever to put these on since the old hoses were nasty and dry rotted, but after taking 2.5 hours to get all the hoses on I was shocked how awesome they looked. Really high quality material. I was a bit worried at first since i never heard of this brand before, but I wanted the complete set instead of paying around the same price for just the upper and lower radiator hoses. Can't really tell if it did anything performance wise since I still have the stock civic radiator, might have lowered the engine temp alittle but bother crazy. I'm the type of person who like high end stuff and is very picky with what I buy. this is definatley high end and I approve 100%  The blue color really looks nice if you already have matching blue part in your engine bay.

Very durable, I feel like it could lift the truck by itself if need be. I gave it four and not five stars because of the paint job, after four months in the sun it faded pretty bad and is now a salmon/pink colour as seen in the images. I also used anti-seuze in the threading of the bolts so that constant exposure to the elements doesn't cause these to become weather fused.

Purchased this to touch up the grey trim pieces on my 2000 Jeep Wrangler. The Wrangler doesn't have a lot of miles, but it isn't a show car either.Seems to have restored the grey to black.  A couple pieces did need some extra attention. I did not tape off the painted areas, which could have been a mistake.  I ended up applying to the running boards as well and it restored a little shine to them as well.  Seems to work better with the soft plastic. Pleased with this purchase.  Before and after photos attached.  Will try to follow up with an update this Summer if I can remember to do so.

These lights exceeded my expectations! My son first bought a set for his Mazda 3 and I helped him install them. I was so impressed by them and the price that I ordered a set for myself. I installed them on my Harley Davidson for Myrtle Beach fall bike week. They were a real hit. Easy installation, low price, remote control with multiple colors, fades, and beat to the music.

Bent on the first valve I used it on (see photo) Have to think that either the reviews are off or they have a bad batch that some of us get. Maybe for a lawnmower or other small engine like that it might work - but it did not come close to working on the 450cc dirtbike head I was working on.

Protrudes ~ 3 inches longer than the bumper on the BMW E91 (2011 wagon).  A little too far for people walking thru parking lots and in the garage.  LT update - after 1 year it has held up OK.  I've had to re-tighten it several times on the center bolt (requires removal of the license plate) - this time I added a locking washer to makeit stay tight (hopefully for 12+ months this time).

Packaged well, came with hood seal trim piece, and metal clips so you do not need to buy anything to install. Came in flat black unpainted but is smooth and the inside was also black, leading me to believe that it is a fully black impregnated piece which is a good thing.  Install was pretty easy, I had to smooth out a small clip hole for one of the foglights but it was an easy fix. Install on the jeep was pretty simple and went well, Everything lined up and the clips snapped in(make sure the metal clips are snapped on the pegs but not deep, otherwise they won't snap in place on the jeep).  I installed it raw, without painting it for now.All in all its a great price, to update/personalize your Jeep JK and I'm very happyKeep in mind before installing this you should buy/install some kind of mesh/guard/inserts to protect your radiator from stones/bugs/ damage.

Installed on a 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport.  Install was fairly easy.  I think it was a 10 mm bolt and the hardest part was just getting my ratchet in a good spot too tighten the fasteners so this thing doesn't fly off.  This is a cheap fix and if it last me two years I'll be happy.  Hopefully removing it when it rust won't be a problem.Edit April 1st *********Product has now rusted so bad I need to take it off.  I guess Ill have to find a better quality product.  If you are looking for a short fix this will work for you but Im looking for something that will last longer than a year.

So, I was in need of an upgrade to a rear hitch bumper step I had installed on an old Chevy Silverado 12+ years ago. That step migrated over to my 2006 Denali and although it still worked,  I wanted something sleeker, longer and a bit more "updated.""As is," this DID NOT completely do it for me, but with a little ingenuity I took this very well built step, added on some sleek Leading edge trailer lights and BAM!!! I got exactly what I was looking for.The step is VERY WELL constructed and for it's size and length, actually feels lighter than my older, shorter hitch step. It easily supprts my weight (200lbs) and because I was being silly and wanted to just try, supports my weight while hold a deadlight bar with an additional 150+lbs on it. I even moved side to side to see if I could torque it a bit. It's pretty dang rock solid!!If you check out the photos you'll see the lights I chose to add take up 90% of the length of the step - which is EXACTLY what I wanted.It comes disassembled but with a few common tools only takes a few minutes to assemble and install. I took a little longer since I was doing a bit of some fabrication, but even with that little project, I had the entire thing completed in less than 3 hours.Delivery was pretty speedy. As I stated earlier construction and material are pretty sturdy and it has the feel and look of a quality professional aftermarket item. Even the folks at the dealership have inquired about where I got it.Price was pretty reasonable and since it is constructed of an aircraft aluminum type material, I don't see it rusting anytime soon.

First off, I want to say it took over a month for this cover to arrive. Communication was good but they could never confirm a ship date.This is my first time buying this brand. In the past, I have owned the CoverKing Stretch indoor covers. The CoverKings price at $360 is almost twice the price as this cover. So, is this cover worth it spending half the money of the CoverKing?  Maybe.The material itself is similar, but the CoverKing is noticeably thicker. As for softness of the lining, this one might be a little softer to the touch than the CoverKing but both are extremely soft. As protection goes from accidentally bumping something against the car cover, the CoverKing will protect better on light impacts. The CoverKings inside lining material is white, where this cover is black. Not a huge issue, but you have to look closely on which side goes against the paint, since both sides are black in color.My last CoverKing was on my Camaro, so it may not be fair to compare this cover to the fit on my Corvette. However, the CoverKing stretched down lower covering all of the wheels. This Corvette cover falls a little short leaving the bottom of the wheel exposed.The CoverKing is better, no doubt. It fits better and its thicker for better bump protection. However, both inner liners are extremely soft and very safe for your paint. Taking the cost difference in consideration, this cover will do a fine job. If spending an additional $150 isn't a huge deal for you, buy the CoverKing. If you are having a hard time spending $360+ on the CoverKing, this one will not disappoint for the price.  Hope this review was helpful.

Perfect for use as a battery compartment vent on my DIY motorcycle camper. Drilled a large hole using an appropriately sized holesaw, and mounted with rivets. Put a spacer under each mounting hole otherwise it'll distort a little bit when the rivet pulls it in. Point the louvers down for a mostly water-resistant installation.

Love these tires. Put them on my 2015 Arctic cat XR 700. Since I do alot of street riding these were my best option as I burned my stocks off in under 400 miles. Put 500 on the Mongrels and they still look brand new. Get a ton of compliments on them!Only issue so far is they seem to be out of round, as my atv wobbles a bit at certain speeds. Tried to balance them to no avail. Going to try balancing beads next

This fits fine on 2013, 2014, and 2015 Wrangler Unlimiteds. I installed it in my 2015 Rubicon Unlimited in about 30 minutes. You just have to remove a small plate under the seat with a torx t30 and zip tie the cables to the holes the plate was attached to. You can see the wires and molex plug in my photos. There's plenty of wire to ride across the top of the box and not get bound up. Bestop includes the zip ties you need in the box. Drawer is smooth and does not rattle. If you're not stout, you may have issues removing the factory seat bolts, they are really tight.

As an automotive DIYer, my wife thought this would be a great gift. She was somewhat correct. The overall construction seems reasonably sturdy for the price and I was initially excited to use it. Like many other reviewers however, I found assembly instructions and quality control to be lacking BIG TIME!For starters, my outer box was poorly taped & partially open, as were the smaller caster box and hardware bag inside.Then we move on to the one manufacturing flaw. While my unit did have holes welded in place where you're supposed to secure the casters to the head frame, the holes were NOT threaded as stated in the poorly written assembly instructions likely written by some employee watching NETFLIX on their cellphone. Instead, they were smooth bore holes at least 1/8 of an inch too big for the threaded caster posts.I then though that perhaps, since my packaging included an extra pair of nut & washer combos, maybe I should have been trying to use them to affix the casters to the head frame. No dice. The nuts, which were obviously intended to be used to secure the various frame sections together, had a different thread pattern than the caster posts. The were the correct size, just the wrong thread pattern. A 1/2 turn on to the post made that apparent as the ground to a halt quickly and couldn't even be tightened down with an 18 volt driver.The manufacturer would be well served by designing the unit to use the same nuts throughout instead of using one sized nuts in some places, hex inserts elsewhere and tapped holes in yet other places. This would reduce problems caused by packaging employees including too many of a given part and too few of another. As long as they were sure to include a sufficient number of caster/nut pairs, the problems I and others have experienced would be eliminated entirely. That might make too much sense for a company to actually implement though.Given the lackluster customer experience others have described, in the end Ill probably just go grab some properly threaded nuts from Lowes or Home Depot rather than trying to contact the seller or manufacturer, but Ill certainly never buy from either again.

Simple jack stand for my casita camper, they even nest together for compact storage when not in use.  I have used these several times while camping and while storing my camper.  They are very sturdy and weather resistant and defiantly have a huge range for lift.  The best part is that the entire threaded rod comes off the base along with the nut so if you need to extend them or collapse them quickly you can spin the nut to the location you want and then slide it back into the base unit which is much better than having to rotate the hand for large height changes.  The only disadvantage is they are not designed to lift the camper up so you have to get it to the hight you want then slide these under.

I installed it in about 20 minutes -  you will need a 10mm socket and a torx driver.  Just follow the instructions, unlike other reviewers I didn't have to grind or customize anything, fit my 2003 Ford Ranger just fine.  This one is for the plastic tailgate handle.  Would have given it 5 stars, except the locking cam essentially prevents one half of the handle from actuating the tailgate release latch - the other side has some play.  But to lock the other half of the handle probably would have doubled the cost - and it's already a bit pricey.Update: Make sure you adjust the linkage rods inside the tailgate - if they're too loose you'll get a lot of play on the handle, even when locked

This is a solid unit. Used it to safely and cleanly hook up a ton of accessories on my truck. Power goes through a 100 amp circuit breaker, then this fuse box, then to the assorted accessories or relays as appropriate. I have 8 of the slots in use at this point and it functions as needed.

This stuff is awesome.I didn't purchase it this time through Amazon cause I was already making another order off another site for some items not available here (imagine that), but none the less, I was amazed at how well it worked.Dilute as per the directions, spray onto a dry rim, let it dwell for a minute or so, spray on a bit more and onto your tire brush and work it.  Takes the brake dust off like butter.  I bet if you tried a pressure washer to rinse you probably wouldn't even need to scrub.This is the rim cleaner you're looking for.

Overall this light bar seems pretty decent. I haven't tested it in really rough weather, so I can't comment on how well sealed it is. I installed it in on my can am commander, mainly for use when plowing. The factory headlights are too low, so the plow blocks them. Light isn't quite as bright as I was expecting, but for the price it's pretty nice.I installed it with a on-off-on rocker switch and a 40 amp relay. No issues. I didn't use the mounts that came with it so can't comment on those.

Yamaha owners be advised modifications needed.  I just installed these mirrors on a 2006 Yamaha Silverado 1100. The method needed for me to do this was to use my original factory mirror stems. When I looked at the stems that came with the mirrors I thought they were exactly like what I had except longer which I liked. However when I tried to use the new stems I found that the threads on the newly bought mirror stems were slightly different. The new stems had what I would call a straight thread like most bolts but my original stems had what I would describe as a bit of a spiral type thread. The newly bought mirrors did fit on the end opposite the mounted end that fit to the motorcycle. So I was able to use them with the old mirror stems. I would have liked to have used the new mirror stems as they were almost 2" longer. The pictures below show the new stems(with box) and my old factory mirrors. The other pictures are of the finished mounting on my motorcycle. I have not used them on the road yet. I used "locktite" on the threads and will let stand 24 house for that to cure. I just wanted to let those know who are buying the mirrors for a Yamaha. I did notice on the advertisement description they mentioned Honda, Suzuki and Kawasaki (Yamaha was not mentioned maybe for good reason).

I wanted something that folded up when not in use.  I considered roof bags but they seem like a fuel consumption problem and then I cannot use it when hauling the kayaks.  There is also a hanging bag which sits on the tailgate, but that seemed like one hit wonder and of low utility.  The fold up hitch carrier however can be used on all my vehicles for all kinds of gear and it doesn't tie up roof space.Also.  When installed and loaded with bags, you can still access the rear tailgate which is a huge plus.  I'm thinking that I can put coolers and bikes on this during summer camping trips.We just took a 900mile trip with this and the Curt luggage bag.  This is paired with an '07 Hyundai Santa Fe with a U-Haul hitch.  Install and assembly was super easy. I spent about 1/2hr on assembly and also added more reflective tape.  I got a locking hitch pin for it from Autozone.Due to the location of the vehicle tail lights there was no need to add separate brake lights.  I added some aluminum tape just where the exhaust pipes are located but I'm pretty sure it was not required - the pipes are a tad lower that the carrier and a nice distance away.  The fold up capability is an absolute must if you want to arrive at your destination and then drive around.  I also think that having it folded up stops people from driving into it when unloaded.The unit seems extremely sturdy - much stronger that out Hitch.  With the vehicle loaded with 5-passengers and a small dog we had plenty of space inside for a comfortable long ride done in 7hr 450mile Segments.  There was no noticeable vehicle sway or instabilty.The rear end of the car hung lower due to it being a lightweight vehicle, so the raised section of the hitch support bar helped to keep the load off the ground.  On some occasions like existing a steep driveway, the aft end of the hitch support dragged on the ground a bit but no damage was made to the car or carrier.I added reflective tape to the bottom so that it's more visible at night when folded.Great, sturdy, versatile and well designed unit.

Excellent product. Very tight fit. Great design that allows you to leave sunshade on when you put the hard top back on (though those short bungee balls are a pain to undo when it's time to fasten hard top up front). Really saves my head from the Colorado sun. And the little alien that's included? Yeah, he has a front row seat.

I allowed my daughter in law to use this on her Cadillac because she was bent on washing her car even though we are experiencing near constant rainy days. I originally intended to clean my truck wheels which are exceptionally gross at the moment, but no point until the mud dries.. I bring that up because I was watching her struggle to get the black gunk off her hubs and in the cracks so I told her to go get the stuff inside.It only took a couple of minutes for her to have those things shinning! This worked much quicker than the stuff she had gotten at Auto Zone and I know using less elbow grease made her happy! I was pleased with the shine myself and can not wait til the weather clears good enough to start on my truck tires. I will update with much better photos or video then.I received this Wheel cleaner by Car Guys free to test and review. My review for the moment is based on watching my daughter in law clean her tires and watching her struggle far less with this product than a store bought brand.

The floor mats come with a thick, solid plastic material. However, there are two things I do not like:1. Not-so-good fittingFor the drivers side, it fits reasonably fine with a 0.25"-width & 2"-long small gap. I could accept that.It was a disaster for the passenger side, it was a disaster. There is a 1"width, 4"long gap between the carpet and the floor mat. I tried to adjust the position and angle but the gap is still there.Someone said the fit is perfect, so I would assume the one I received is a defected product or was deformed during the shipping. I do not want to go through the tedious return process and probably will fix that by velcro and some brute force.I am disappointed by the quality, or at least quality control.2. The top surface is slippery.It is made of a hard plastic/rubber material, unlike the soft material of the OEM all-weather floor mats. This make it a bit slippery when I step on it with my wet boots. Not a deal-breaker but it is something definitively can be improved,

Got these for a 2012 cruze, didn't want the WeatherBeaters but they don't make the Contour for this car. These are actually a but nicer than the ones in my Silverado. The outer lip doesn't cover over the top edge like in the silverado but does cover alot more than the factory mats.Definitely recommend them if you want to keep the carpet from getting soggy.

This particular 5" 10W LED work light is perfect for bumpers as that's what we will use ours for.  (I will update once they both are mounted)  These smaller lights would look great on a truck of course as well as an ATV or off road vehicle.  The Auxbeam 5" LED light is a square flush mount mini auxiliary and comes with the mounting hardware.  The design of this 5" LED light is well made and I like that it has features of being waterproof as that comes in quite handy for off road vehicles. This Auxbeam 5" LED light puts off some light and is rather bright.  I would recommend this Auxbeam LED 5" flush mount light to anyone who needs extra light on their outdoor adventures, off road trips, trail riding, and general truck upgrades.  If you have any questions or concerns the seller is prompt and courteous too.  I also have purchased a few lights from Auxbeam including a couple light bars.  We love the products from Auxbeam. The products hold up great and are still going today! Get yourself an Auxbeam light!  You won't regret it!I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review

This is an AMAZING little tool that is truly pocket-sized!  It is 22 different tools in one.  It is well-constructed of heavy-duty stainless steel.  The folding mechanism allows the tool to transform into a size small enough to easily carry in a tool belt or pocket.  It would also be great to keep in a glove box.  The locking mechanism keeps the extensions open and closed.

I bought this as a lower cost option for situations where I may need to winch myself out of trouble. I opted for the synthetic rope for safety reasons, as I do this with my son. Last summer, I went wheeling after a rain storm and found myself stuck more times that I would care to remember (A/T tires are terrible in mud, much less soupy mud).  The winch got quite the workout and never let me down.  I've used this to move sheds and other random other situations where some pull-power is needed.  The rope is fraying a little bit, but I think that's normal.NOTE:  If you are getting a winch for use (not looks), don't forget a snatch block, tree saver, D-rings, gloves, etc. If you don't know how to use it properly, please find a local 4x4 club and learn.  At a minimum, check out YouTube.  These can be really handy, but also dangerous if not used properly.

Simple and should do the job of keeping excess dirt and grime out of the fuel tank.  Another preventive measure to ensure I don't mistakenly put DEF in my diesel tank (yes, I could absolutely do that).

I am giving this a 3 star rating since it does not fit the license plate well.  There are no tabs at the bottom of the frame to hold the frame to the license plate and it results in a tinny rattle when the truck lid is closed (license plate is on the trunk lid).  Also this fits "over" the license plate and does not contain or frame it like others. Also, it covers part of the lower plate high enough to obscure the plate number in some cases. In Calif, the upper right sticker we change every year is behind the plate, requiring the frame to be removed.I used thick foam tape behind the license plate to keep the frame from gouging the paint and secured the frame to the license plate at the bottom with clear packaging tape to eliminate the rattle.The jaguar is bright, shiny, but the frame has a textured or mat finish. It still looks good, even below the chrome on the trunk lid of the Jag. I wanted a leaper on the back of this car and this was the best solution, although the design of this frame has a lot to be desired.

Bright and instant online. I also have the OPT7 Flux beam on another car and the output and cutoff on these are just as good for half the cost. Well built and the fan noise is just like all the others I have use.  The only negative I  have is the mount plate is plastic and not metal like the others.One tip is to use electrical tape to hold the plug in place if you have to flip the polarity and can't use the clip, this will ensure the plug will not come undone.

I've tried every product under the Sun for my cars.  I should have stock in Griot's, Chemical Guys or a few others - lol.  One of the toughest parts of the wash process is the drying.  I even have a twin-4hp Metro Dryer (deluxe kit with 30' hose, cart/wall mount to help get the water out of the door jams, mirrors, and other hiding spots.  In my first outing with Optimum - I marveled at how I only needed 20 minutes start to finish to wash my car.  Literally only used two microfiber towels to dry.  Took my bucket to the kitchen sink to obtain two gallons of reverse osmosis water and added a generous ounce of this stuff; and went to work.  The sheeting action and use of so much less water didn't even permit my rotors to oxidize during the process.  The process with its effortlessly dry each section as you go - accomplished 3 huge things!  a) 20 minutes in and out b) lack of high pressure spraying and aggressive soap didn't subdue my most recent wax and c) wash n instantly buff each section dry produced amazing gloss.  My black car looked like a black mirror so quickly I was blown away!  During my post wash 'excuse to run to the store' - I received a thumbs up at the very first red light and a 'cool car man' from a teen at the market.  Highly recommend!

Step 1: Have your wife always forget to let down the tailgate easily because she owns a newer fancy truck with a hands-free tailgate drop.Step 2: Order DZ43300 for your 2005 Dodge Ram 1500.Step 3: Come home to find an empty Amazon envelope because the delivery guy wanted something free that day.Step 4: Call Amazon and have them send you a replacement.Step 5: Come home to find the wrong tailgate assist in the mail. (They sent the Chevy version - totally different.)Step 6: Call Amazon to sort out problem. Listen to the phrase "Sorry, but not to worry" about 20 or so times.Step 7: Drive to local UPS to drop off wrong item.Step 8: Receive correct part finally after nearly 2 weeks since the original order.Step 9: Install. *Note this is the easiest part of the whole process.Step 10: After carefully following the instructions and measuring everything, test the tailgate 5 times slowly to ensure cable and parts do not damage truck.BONUS STEP: Tailgate slowly lowers itself. Gently closing the tailgate looks good, now let's close the tailgate at a normal pace. ***CRACK*** WTF was that?! Oh, it's just the cable finally deciding to extrude itself from the side of the tailgate and applying enough pressure on my driver-side tail light housing to crack it. No big deal...back to Amazon to order tail lights.

these waroundfitactly what I was looking for. very easy to apply. I use the wet method (look up on YouTube videos).I did have to modify a little fit my tank so it would with the emblem. I also I used one fender decal. I put one part on the front fender and I split up the two smaller parts and place them on either side of the small back fender. I think it came out very nice and am pleased and have received many compliments I would definitely recommend

Wow did this thing exceed expectations. Fit perfect on my 2004 Silverado.  Replaced rusted gas door. Installation instructions were spot on and install went easy... two screws out plus loosening another two to pull the old door out, remove old rubber stops, and two bolts and nuts to install. Make sure you read the instructions fully, especially regarding backing out the two adjustment screws on the left side so it sits tight on the right. Instructions will tell you the secret to only needing two mounting screws instead of four is pressure from the adjustment screws by the hinge. Otherwise it will be loose on the fight side. I was able to get mine on solid and tight by backing out the adjustment screws a little.

Pros: Perfect item for housing switches in your Jeep JK.  The housing switch "pod" is angled in, toward the driver, making reading and using the switches easy and ergonomic.  The color and texture is a much closer match to stock than the Rugged Ridge version.  (I tried that one too and returned it.)Cons: The texture is just slightly off from my stock interior (2016 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited).  It's minor, and I'm likely the only one that will ever notice.Other comments:  As others have noted, the switch panels don't pop out - you have to cut them out.  I cut out one large rectangle (see below), so it didn't really matter to me either way.  But I have to agree with others that say that pop-out panels would be a better solution.This item is not compatible with the 2016s (and maybe other years as well).  Do your homework on Daystar's website first and make sure you know what you're getting.  I modified the bottom of the piece to make it fit.  Once installed, there's a small gap at the bottom, but (like the texture) I'm likely the only one to notice.  Even with the gap, it still looks 1000x better than the Rugged Ridge version.I used the pod to house the switch box on a Switch-Pros SP8100.  I measured, marked and cut the round-corner rectangular opening for the switch box and mounted it into the A-pillar pod by pressing it through from the back.  It was a ton of work - took about 3 hours to get it all cut properly.  But the end result is excellent - looks like it was put there at the factory.Bottom line: Yes, I would absolutely buy it again for any JK, regardless of the year.  It's worth the extra trimming effort to get a professional-looking switch housing.  Just take your time with it, trim where needed (if needed), and make it work.  You won't regret it.

I got tired of the factory antenna on my Raptor hitting the top of every parking garage I entered so I purchased a CravenSpeed Stubby Antenna.  It was a very well made item and, at 3 inches, there was never any height issues.  However, the one problem I did run into is that I had problems receiving HD radio stations since I'm at least 50 miles away from the broadcast location (closer to town it worked just fine).  Not wanting to go back to the full size factory antenna I figured I'd give the AntennaX Off-Road antenna a try.The extra 10 inches the AntennaX provides over the Stubby certainly does help with reception.  I can now receive those HD stations without any issues.  The off-road style of the antenna also looks good on my Raptor.The reason it gets 4 stars, however, is because the antenna flexes excessively at freeway speed.  In the attached photo I was traveling at approximately 70 mph and, as you can see, the antenna is bent back pretty good.  I really don't mind that since it doesn't appear to affect reception, but I do wonder if eventually the antenna will start remaining in that position instead of returning upright when I slow down.  I'm going to keep my eye on it and if it does begin to permanently stay in that position I will amend my review.

With 4 receivers you can pick whatever you want so when they get misplaced you can easily find them. This key finder comes with 4 sticky adhesives so if the item doesn't have a hole for the key loop you can easily attach the receiver with the adhesives; there is also a adhesive velcro so you can put it on the transmitter and keep it in a safe place.I decided to use 2 of the receivers for the remotes in my bedroom, 1 for my iPad, and I'm still debating on the 4th item. I was able to attach the receivers to my remotes with the sticky adhesive and used the key loop on my iPad case. I used the velcro to place the transmitter on my nightstand so I will always know where it is.Setting up the receivers to the transmitter is very easy as all you have to do is take out the blocking pieces in each battery (batteries included) compartment and click the color button that matches the receiver color (white, red, blue, and black). This does come with easy to follow instructions just in case. The beeping sound is a really good volume so you will be able to find your items easily. I would definitely recommend this WTR Key Finder!**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**

moved a 20' storage container from trailer to trailer. I bought this to get a 20' connex box from one trailer to another. the container weighed about 6000lbs. I mounted the winch with a universal mount plate to the trailer. out of the box the winch needs to have to control box mounted to it, it has about 3 or 4 different mounting options and all the hardware needed for that is provided and It comes with 4 bolts for mounting to a steel plate. I will be mounting this on my jeep next. as for the pull, it moved the container almost the whole way without a snatch block, I only needed to use a block for the last few inches. 6000lbs of a flat steel box across a wood deck. great winch!

I have a 1987 Chevrolet R10 Silverado that I absolutely love but it has no cup holders. I've looked at several different options but could never find one that didn't take away from the looks of the truck. I found these and I thought I would give them a shot and so far I am very pleased! They seem to be very sturdy and blend in fairly well. Even my wife thought they were nice! I've read reviews saying these wear out eventually so I will update this if that happens.

I was worried how well this would stick to the chrome bumpers on my 2010 Power Wagon. Prep work is key, so I pulled the bumpers, sanded them down with a grinder and 100 grit sanding wheels. Cleaned with air and xylene. I'd advise a drill mixer to mix this stuff up, shaking will not work. First coat looked pretty bad after going on... big gaps, uneven texturing. I was not prepared for how much this stuff dripped. It will stick to and ruin anything it touches, wish I would have covered everything with plastic first. It took way longer than expected to dry, as it only about 50F in the garage. Ended up turning on a propane heater to help. Took about 6 hrs to set up enough for a second coat. The second coat went on well, and filled in all the gaps and evened out the texturing. This product will leave a very textured surface, more than I wanted. However, I'm overall very pleased with the finished product. I plan to replace the bumpers in a year or so, but I expect this product to hold up for a long time. If I see any flaking or peeling, post will be updated. So far it's survived the damp Oregon winter and some icy trips to Crater Lake at 20F with no issues.

I have a soft spot in my heart for sasquatch and when I was looking for a light switch for my snowblower I knew I had to make it work! Well I got it to fit and works great! My snowblower lights have to run off a battery, that is why I only have it light up when the lights are on and the text isn't lit up. I'll have to rig it up so the text turns on as well. I'm sire there is a configuration with the provided jumpers to do that. Wish the included instructions came with more detailed configurations but I also know that my need is very specific and that most wouldn't be using this switch like I would be.

I purchased this light bar for my golf cart and it seems to be holding up nicely.  Throws a good amount of light for getting to and from the barn at night.  Install was fairly simple although I need longer hardware.  Auxbeam claims two different mounting styles provided but mine only came with one style.  I do wish I could have angled this down a little more but it works well as is.

Have only mounted the Deluxe Wheel Chock in my  garage floor I chose to use anchors bolts directly to the concrete. Two were sufficient to hold this in place and keep my 2014 FLHTCU upright with no problems. Also unlike most of the other teeter totter wheel chocks the front tire does not sit on the chock making removal easier. The 2014 Ultra Classic weights in at over 900 lbs and and I am a buck 70 backing it out is no problem. One thing that did take some getting used to was when driving into the chock with the fairing on the Full Dresser you can not see to line it up. I just found a spot on the garage wall used some painters tape and head for that problem solved. Have not tried the tie downs yet but principle is sound and will install them soon.

Oh man these are too cool.  I am not sure why all the people say they use locktite.  They each come with 2 washers and a lock washer.  I simply tightened them up and that was is.  Logged 60 miles yesterday in them on a VTX 1300 which is a ball tickler if you catch my drift.  Meaning these did not come loose, did not turn sideways, but stayed the course.  I only bought 2 because I think 4 is overkill.I'd rather have the 2 reflectors on bottom and the two skull nuts on top.  Gives it a more even "cool" look.  I'm happy with these.  The skull heads are not die cast metal, not sure what they are.  you can tell that the bolt, nut and washers weigh more than the skull heads themselves.  However, they server their purpose - they look cool and that's what I was looking for.  Please with this purchase and this product.  I would recommend to anyone.

I like this product and others have had really good luck with it but I will say if you are going to do yellow over black (or other dark colors) you will need more of this than you think.  I covered black calipers on a new Corvette Grand Sport and it took two full containers to cover it to where the black didn't show through.Be patient with this product.  It really does level itself over time and the initial coats will have you thinking it is not going to look good.  Follow the directions and enjoy the outcome.

I use this float on my Keurig style coffee maker to automatically maintained the water level in the reservoir. [We use the machine's hot water for other things too] and the first float lasted me almost two years, so I bought another to replace it. Unfortunately when any float switch fails you end up with a flood, so make sure you have a back up on your system.

Any bulb that has a coating is going to have reduced output.  END OF STORY.  Manufacturers who claim their coatings reflect light back into the filament to make them brighter, or they use some exotic gas, or whatever, blah, blah, blah are all liars.Furthermore, there is no such thing as a 45W 9145/H10 bulb.  They are ALL 42W.  Just like this one.  If you actually LOOK on the bottom of these bulbs, they are STAMPED "42W", NOT 45W, even though the package SAYS 45W.  So even this company is lying to your face.That being said, IF you have a need for a very white bulb, the thick blue coating on these will probably go nicely with your HID bulbs.  Just know that the output is greatly reduced.  So more show than go.I put these right next to my OEM H10/9145 42W Sylvania's for this comparison.

This is a nicely made pad that I got to replace another of a different brand that had broken. I attached this to the foot of my kickstand with a couple of small bolts to make it a permanent part of the kickstand. I have already done this with another bike; it is always there so you don't have to fumble for it when stopping on soft ground, it doesn't interfere with the operation of the kickstand, and it never gets left behind.

It got the job done. I ordered this because I was hauling a U-Haul from TN to TX (4x8 trailer) and it was cheaper here than anywhere local. The metal was chipped (not a big deal) and some slight rust on the ball (again no big deal). I have had this on my Jeep for less than a month and the ball is really starting to show rust all around the top now even though I have tried to clean it off. It worked for what I needed it to and that's about it, although I was expecting it to stay nicer for a little longer.

Fits 2018 Ram 1500 with factory flares on fender perfectly. Some of the negative reviews are because they ordered the wrong flaps. If you order these and you don't have the fender flares they will have a gap and not look as good. Took less than 20 minutes to install fit perfectly easy to understand instructions.

Got these installed in my 2016 Malibu Primier. I had to drill out my dust cap so could get the wires through. I wasn't able to drill a circle so it isn't a perfect seal. I used a canceller harness on the driver side. Haven't gotten any bulb out warnings. I did not use any relay harness. Plugged directly into stock.There is some light scatter above the cut off line, but I'm not sure what type of impact that has for oncoming drivers.I drove down a dirt road and it's like it's daylight out.So far so good. Will need to check on the glare, but apart from that it's good.

For the price this is a great carrier.  It was very easy to assemble but mine had a missing 3/8 carriage bolt.  Hence the reason for only four stars. So I had to make a trip to my local hardware store on that one.  There are red reflector tapes on each end wrapping around to the back.  I made an upgrade here be bolting on two small red marker lights and a wiring plug for my trailer light plug.  I use my carrier on a 2015 Jeep Wrangler with factory spare tire. And when carrier is mounted the carrier comes out far enough that your load you are carrying is out past the tire.  There is only one hitch pin hole and allows carrier to suspend out past tire.  I drilled another pin hole so I have a choice to mount carrier all the way forward giving it more rigidity and less overhang.Lights used on my project were Blazer B486R red mini clearance marker sold on Amazon.

I installed these on a 2016 F150.  These are fairly easy to install, but expect to work to wiggle and flex them into the correct positions for installation.  The driver side was easier than the passenger.  On the driver's side, 3 out of the 4 holes lined up for the screws.  I tried all sorts of maneuvers to get the 4th to align, but ended up just making another hole and attaching that way.The passenger side, boy way that different.  I adjusted to get the two middle holes aligned and was able to flex the plastic enough to get the back screw aligned, but the front took a good amount of muscle to get aligned.  Once I did though, the edges had to be forced into shape and tucked behind the trim.  I have a slight bump as shown on the pictures that could not be taken out.  Wondering if the holes were off ever so slightly to cause this.It does improve the look of the truck as shown in the pictures, but I wish the holes were better aligned.

Boxed very well. Not exactly the color i was expecting though. Purchased in april 2018. Just installed august 2018 because the entire front bumper has to come off to access the fog bulbs. Will update with anymore changes. Havent done any night driving.Update: night driving. Holy crap these are really bright. gives a whitish/blue hue down by the road but very bright and cast the fog beams alot further than it really should haha.I would buy them again but in 5K for a pure white. I run hid headlights and with those on and then turning my fogs on there is a substantial visibility increase even with hid headlights

I have been hesitant to start working on my car due to feeling apprehensive about getting underneath the vehicle.Many reviews for other jack stands had negative comments about the quality of the welds, or the jack stands looked and felt sub quality and questioned the safety of the product.These stands are overkill for my 4 door Chevy Cruze, however I wanted something that I could also use on my GMC Yukon when I decide to tackle some repairs on the SUV. I knew that I would have to jack my car up pretty high to get these underneath, but I wanted the heaviest set of jack stands that would still work, so that I could get under the car and not have to worry about being crushed.After receiving these stands, I was not disappointed in the quality. Each stand is clearly labeled as being rated for 6 ton capacity. The welds are definitely not professional mig welds, but were solid with no gaps and overall acceptable compared to the pictures I saw on other products. My fears about getting under the car were eased after seeing how solid these stands are!The minimum height is about 14 3/4 inches. This means for my cruze, which sits about 5 inches off the ground, I have to jack my car up about 10 inches. This is pretty high for the car; however, I have a low profile floor jack that can go up to 18 1/2 inches, so I had no problem getting the car up on these stands.The maximum height is about 23 inches if you sit the stand on the highest groove. This seems way too wobbly to make me feel safe, so I feel there must be something against setting it to the max height somewhere. Kind of like not standing on the top run of a ladder...However, I think these stands will be more than high enough to hold my SUV, which is a good bit higher than my car and will need about 18 inches.Using these jack stands I successfully propped up my Cruze and replaced the front disc break pads, and changed the oil. Both of these operations were very easy to do with the extra height that these stands forced me to use. I plan on tackling break jobs on my SUV in the future and will update if I have any issues with the height.Note: After using the 6 ton stands, I would purchase the 3 ton stands for use with my car to reduce the amount of jacking necessary. For now I will stick with these because they get the job done and make me feel safe.

For the size of this DC fan, you would think it would turn out better air flow (CFM's),but it is weak at best.I bought an 02Cool from Amazon a couple of weeks ago that impresses me more (due to it's small size), at under $8.00 that does not require (8)D batteries (only two), and whats with having to leave your keys in the ignition. (I regress)Also the product you will receive looks different than the one pictured; See my 3 JPG's.I would pass on this one.

First of all, these bulbs are original there is a QR code on the box which you can scan and it will take you to a verification website by OSRAM. once you put the code under the QR in. The serial numbers for the bulbs Will display which should match the ones on the bottom of both bulbs.I bought these bulbs as a replacement for my Infiniti m35x HID D2S Philip 4300k oem bulbs. These bulbs put so much light on the road at a distance that is better than oem (10 years diffrence in technology). I never noticed my adaptive headlights as much as I do now. tackling blind Corners is a lot safer thanks to these bulbs. The light is projected in a very spacific pattern and not all over the place.I installed these myself. When installed, these bulbs had a slight yellow tint to them so I proceeded to keep the headlights on whenever I can to get in the 10 hours burn time needed for them to reach 5000 - 5500k temperature.I was amazed by these lights they have the perfect color temperature that I was looking for. If looked at from any other angle other than straight front they give a slight blue tint. But from the front its pure white.Do not buy cheap bulbs for your car they can cause fuses to burn, they are a fire hazard and they can shatter in The headlights. Be safe and be smart. I would gladly answer question so Dont hesitate to ask

These lights are at least twice as bright as stock. Way more downroad light. I should've done this mod a long time ago. I put these on my 05 Accord. The bulb vane must be cut a bit to make it fit into the headlight, but anyone can do it if they want to.

First off, let me say that I am big Chemical Guys fan.  I tried their V line of polishes about 2 years ago, and I was so satisfied that I switched to their entire line of products:  From soap to quick detailer, to rim and wheel cleaner, to pads, glaze, sealant, wax etc  And, I never looked back.I use 2 random orbital polishers:  A Griot Garage 6, and a Rupes 21 Mark II.  I bought 2 sets of Chemical Guys hex logic pads, one for each random orbital.Unfortunately, I must report that for the first time, I am very disappointed and unsatisfied by a Chemical Guys product:On the one hand, I have been using one set of pads with the Griot Garage for 2 years, and, while they show some normal wear and tear the pads are still good to go.On the other hand, the set of pads I use with the Rupes (this is the one for which I am writing this review)  is just not it:The black pads scratch unglued on the very first use, and, the white pad started disintegrating on the second use.  At high rpms (above setting 4 on the Rupes), the center of the pads seems to get rather warm after roughly 30 minutes of use, and, they start to wobble on the orbital's plate  making polishing difficult.  This wobbling may be what caused the scratch of the black pad to become unglued and the white pad to start disintegrating.The Rupes is a more powerful tool than the Griot Garage.  So, it seems that the hex logic pads cant withstand the power of the Rupes while they work well with the Griot Garage.This is a disappointment.In all, I would not recommend you buy these pads if you intend to use them with a tool as powerful as the Rupes 21 Mark II at high rpms.  They simply cant take it.

Purchased this to plug into my Ram Ecodiesel. Plug is exact match and powers my block heater in anticipation for cold temps. You simply can't beat the price - the OEM harness is north of $100 (although it does have some wiring loom and aluminum tape). Two zip ties and this thing is ready! I added a strip of aluminum  tape to match that of the OEM harness, but it is not necessary.

I installed these on my 2009 FX35 and they definitely illuminate.  They are much brighter and whiter than my stock D2S Xenon HID headlights.  I determined that I cannot drive with these fog lights on without blinding oncoming vehicles.  For the safety of others on the road, I have decided to just go with (zXe Sylvania) halogen bulbs.  Hopefully those work out better for me.  The least bright picture (#1) are my D2S headlights without the fogs on.  The 2nd picture you can tell the fogs are on and the illuminate above my headlights.  I stood in front of my car and it looked like high beams coming at me.  Not safe in my opinion.

Bought this for use with my 4WD truck and jeep for airing up my tires. Did a ton of research and decided on the Viair 450P but still wasn't sure what I was going to think of this unit. After getting it and some use I am actually really impressed with the quality of everything that comes with the compressor. The air gun and pressure gauge are well made and seem heavy duty. The hose and clamp on air chuck are both nice - hose is made of nice rubber and the air chuck is heavy cast metal vs stamped bendable steel. The long curly air hose is NOT the typical cheap plastic hose (usually yellow and cracks or shatters after any small amount of time in the sun). It is rubber coated with a woven/braided line. Very flexible and also fits nice into the front bag pocket. The bag seems nice and has plenty of room for everything. Material is a little thinner than I would prefer but zippers are large and smooth and bag has plenty of room for everything. The compressor itself is solid and well put together. Nice handle and base. Fairly quiet in my opinion when running. It pumps up one of my trucks 33"x10.5 inch 10ply/E-Load tires from 30psi to 70psi in about 5 minutes. The auto shut-off feature is great when you are switching to another tire or the other side of the vehicle, as the compressor quits pumping - and generating heat. The 450P kit comes with extra air intake filters and some different ends for the air gun (like a needle for pumping up a basketball). The model 450 compressor is rated at a 100% duty cycle, meaning it is built to be continuously run for up to an hour. Other Viair models that have a higher air/CFM output rating, like the 400 & 440, are rated at a 33% duty cycle, meaning they can run for about 20 minutes before needing to be shut off to cool down - see Viair's website for the specs. So depending on your intended use, the 400 or 440 may be a better choice due to the faster fill rates. For me, the benefit of the 100% duty cycle is I can fill my tires (that require a higher PSI) PLUS fill my trail buddy's tires as well, and NOT exceed the rated run time. Overall very happy with this product.

Purchased for my 2002 Chevy Tahoe LS.PROS:Installation was pretty easy and all the lights work.  The white light is a VAST improvement over the old yellow bulbs.  Shipping was very fast!  Will definitely order from LEDpartsNow again.CONS:This kit did NOT include 2 LED lights for the front floor or 2 lights for the exterior side mirrors.SUMMARY:Upon installing, I had 4 lights leftover and thought they sent me the wrong ones.  As I was writing out the email to contact them, I re-read the product description and realized that the leftover lights are for the vanity mirrors, not the floor and side mirrors.I am a little disappointed that the kit did not include these 4 lights, but, if I had carefully read the description then I would have realized that.The floor lights are the same as the license plate, door, and map lights.  The side mirror lights appear to be the same as the larger tubular dome lights.  I am considering trading out the license plate LEDs with the floor and maybe the cargo dome with the side mirrors to minimize how weird it looks until I can get some more bulbs ordered.

Very wide knuckles even if you get the smallest size. I could probably fit another knuckle or 2 in there. Thin-ish material on the palms, I prefer a little bit more cushion for riding. It looks sturdy enough so I'll use these but it's not a perfect pair for me.

Let me tell you a story of how this stuff completely destroyed my motorcycle. I had been using Factory coolant in my 2009 Suzuki Gsx-R 750 since i bought it. I never had any problem. I did track days in 100F+ and never had heating problems. The bike was fine and had no signs of any problems. I then was told by one of the track day vendors that i can't run antifreeze in my bike, because it super slippery if you crash and it gets on the track. So i research on what i need to do and i had two options Royal Purple-Purple Ice+ or W.W. My local parts store had Purple ice so i decided to go with that. I followed the instructions on the bottle. "Bottled, Filtered drinking water is recommended." This should have been a huge red flag. so i went and got a bag of 12, 12oz bottles to fill my coolant system. I did the "2oz per quart of coolant with straight water." Fast forward to after my next track day. The day went fine no cooling problems. I take the bike home and off the truck and park it in my garage for 5 days until the next weekend. I start to put all my street stuff back on the bike to go riding the next weekend and i notice a small amount of water under my bike and that all my hoses are rock hard and there is a ton of pressure in the coolant system. figuring that is REALLY odd after 5 days. I relieved the pressure out of the system and called a freind that owns a motorcycle shop. he advised to check the thermostat to see if it stuck closed with something clogging the little check valve. Upon draining the system a torrent of white chunks came pouring out. Pictures included. After putting 100% Distilled water in the bike and bleed the system and warmed the bike up to put some pressure in the system, Water started to leak out of my radiator. I removed the Factory radiator and had it pressure tested. This stuff eat away the radiator, there were hundreds of little pin holes in the radiator air bubbles were coming out of the fins. and one thing i found out is that factory radiators for motorcycles are NOT cheap, 700$+. So i was forced to get a cheap reman radiator that doesn't flow as well. after about 5 months and 4 more track days i can tell you this stuff has lined my engine with whatever this white stuff is and i have been having cooling problems since. if its anywhere in the 90F+ after i get back to the pits my bike is boiling over. Even with it running the bike doesn't drop below 230F+ so when i cut the flow off it spikes to over 250 and the distilled water boils out and i have to add water. So to date i have flushed my bike well over 20 times with nothing but distilled water and i still have problems and i still get white stuff coming out. I was planning on doing a race season but i guess that's out on this bike. THANKS ROYAL PURPLE for potentially costing me thousands of dollars to rebuild or buy a new motor!The pictures are from the first 10 or so flushes.

Installed on 01 GMC Sierra 1500. Solid welded coil spacers. Install took about 10 hours due to locked up tie rods (that had to be replaced) and upper ball joint. Had to use coil compressor to get coils back in after adding the spacer on top, wasn't enough angle on lower control arm to lift with jack. Initially installed rear lift blocks as shown in pic but removed them to get the level look i was going for. Made the ride a little stiffer but wheels don't rub inside fender anymore when i hit a dip and it's noticeably taller from in the truck too.  Added before and after pics from each side.

I never really had an effective way to determine the health of my car batteries. Now with the Solar BA9 the answer is only seconds away. For the first time I know with certainty if a battery is good, bad or somewhere in between. I previously thought that a good voltage reading was a great indicator of battery health. Not so! I now know that it is CCA (cold cranking amps) that provides the real answer. The BA9 tells you quickly if your battery is producing enough CCA's to be reliable and analyzes the internal plates for conductance at the same time. According to Solar tech support, any reading 20% or more below the rated CCA indicates a battery that is no good or will fail soon. Example: a battery rated at 1000 CCA is considered bad if it is producing less then 800 CCA. Knowing this information gives you a lot of confidence in the ability of your car to start. In addition the BA9 performs other useful tests, such as an alternator and starter test. This is a must have device. I also have a BA7 which is very similar except the BA9 has 3 additional but not essential features: State of Health, State of Charge and Internal Resistance. But the main difference between the 2 units is that the BA7 is using a 1 line LED display which is slightly more difficult to interpret due to the limitations of the LEDs for displaying text, when compared to the BA9 which has a 4 line backlit LCD display with plain English text. Some say the BA9 is easier to read in the sun which is a characteristic of LCD displays. For a great carrying case, see my photo of the Pelican 1060 Micro Case which holds the BA9(or BA7) the manual and cables perfectly.

These worked perfect to really bring out the look of the front end.  My jeeps yellow grill was just too much yellow.  Very simple installation that my 11-year old grandson did it himself.  The plastic inserts have tiny nubs on the them to allow them to snap in on your grill.  I have had no problem with them staying there and I even removed them at one point and then reinserted them when I painted the grill.  The help up perfectly.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. I've worked on engines for almost 50 years, and still work on classic cars ( meaning carbureted) . I've used the "plug chop and read" method all this time with fair results. I now live at 7500' altitude and like to drive from here to the mountains and back in a day or two drive. Some cars stall out on drives to 10,000+ feet from fouled plugs.This device along with the accessory tailpipe tool taught me in one hour what I'd be guessing at all these years. ( I did have to put a 24" extension tube on the tail pipe accessory to prevent it from reading reversion of O2 into the tailpipe, easy enough with some red silicone hose)I just dropped from a 240 main jet to a 200 on a Harley 120R motor with a CV 51MM carb. Runs better than ever, no guess work.Set up was 20 minutes, everything I needed ( except the extension hose) was included. Trimmed from idle thru WOTI'm sure my carbed sports car friends will want to borrow it......right Mark?

I'm only giving it two stars, because it did work out of the box. After four and a half months of use it failed. After some disassembly I found the relay has zero effective moisture prevention and zero vibration damping. One of the resistors completely corroded through and broke away from the board and the others all look to be in bad shape. If you live in a desert this product might last several years, but anywhere with even a bit of moisture and this thing will not last. That is a design flaw that the company absolutely has to be aware of. It could be solved with a nickel's worth of silicone sealant, but they haven't bothered.

Amazing... just installed on my 2010 C14 Concours. A tip the H4 has high and low beam in one bulb so you MUST install the bulb with the projector reflector cups facing up ...like tiny bowl facing up.Then you MUST adjust the C14 Concours headlights down lower to concentrate the low beam ...the reason is the light tips are a bit longer than original halogen bulbs ... I used my garage door to adjust and level the lights cut off on low beam.... high beam is off the dial bright and wider than original ... much needed... I live where deer are very active at night.I'll update on durability as time passes. If they last I'll give them a five star.Went riding at night on country road with no street lights or moonlight allowed me to fine tune the LED's for maximizing range and cut off on low beam... get the lows right and the high beams are even better. Take the time and effort to adjust them properly and they are now better than the lights on my 2015 AMG Mercedes. I'm impressed and now giving them 5 stars.

For price, awesome system.  Sounds about 3 to 4 times louder than stock.  Easy to install.  I was actually pleased with the alignment.  I was expecting it to be off before installing but on the first try, it is about 95% aligned.  Now for the bad, shipping package was horrible.  Box was all torn up and pieces hanging out of the box.  Surprisingly no marks on the exhaust itself due to shipping. One bolt was missing but Home Depot has that covered.  The mid pipe hangers don't seem like they are long enough.  Mine just barely fits on.  I will need to keep an eye on it to make sure it stays on the rubber hangers securely.

I was installing a few new upgrades in my car which needed 12V. I discovered there were already some wires tapped into the fuse panel but they were not done in a good way. See photos.Using this kit I was able to clean up the prior wires, and make a decent installation of the new 12V wire as well. Another bonus is there are now two slots for fuses. One slot is for the existing fuse that originally came in the car. The second is for the new added equipment.

This is a great product. Some reviews said it was cheaply made. I would agree but disagree because in the Bak promos the did say what kind of material their products or product is made. The reason for the four stars is because I received the package with no exterior damage but damage to the product itself. I think Bak should have an inspection sheet in their box when it is being shipped that clears the air about how the product was packaged and that it was shipped in good condition with no defects or damages. Luckily I am not someone that can't mend and bend things back to shape. Besides those issues, I would say that it was a perfect fit for my 2014 Chevy Silverado High Country. Also, I noticed that the right front end/ corner where the right rail was installed. There is not enough glue or sticky residue on the when to keep it from rising. I would like to know what can I get to stick or keep that down. Other than that I am most satisfied with how the product fit on the truck bed. The two first pics illustrates the damage parts of the rails.

We have a small Palomino popup that we had inadvertently screwed up the frame by thinking the rear stabilizer jacks were ok for leveling. After a serious mishap in the middle of nowhere in which the frame actually snapped and shredded a tire, there was the expense of frame repair and replacing a tire. If it hadn't been for an oil field worker in his Magic Truck of Equipment who actually bent the frame back into place and spot welded it and then swapped out the spare, I might have left that thing sitting on the side of the road to be picked over by the buzzards. After that experience, I realized we must have been doing something wrong for the past 3 years of owning this little camper. We knew we weren't coming anywhere near to overloading it, there's not that much room in it for stuff or people, two of us at most, on a few occasions adding a small grandchild. I came across this leveler while looking at things like jack stands... the rest is history. I have a 12 inch tire and it fits quite well, no modifications needed. We had a very level spot the fist time out and barely needed to level up an inch, if that, but it did the job. And my rear stabilizers did their job of stabilizing and that was it.. with the front supported by the jack stands I bought, we had no excess movement in that camper for the first time since we've had it. Live and learn... and buy this.

mixed and installed today so will take a good look at it in AM and from initial color is darker than the pic shows for the blue.  had enough in the kit to do the big brakes on the Mustang but not enough to do centers of rotors which I had wanted to.EDIT UPDATE 9-30-17  Some chips and places have shown up on most all 4 of the calipers.  Dropped my rating to 3 stars for these "chips-popped lose places."  I'm attaching a pic of the caliper thru the rim, this is after 8~10K miles, I bought it in Aug of 16 and installed it a few weeks later.  It was left to set over winter on my Mustang with rims off so should have been well cured..<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/G2-High-Temperature-Brake-Caliper-Paint-System-Set-Blue-G2162/dp/B000G28PPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">G2 High Temperature Brake Caliper Paint System Set Blue G2162</a>

I installed this in my 2006 Hummer H3. The old one was seized in pretty good, but this one came with some antiseize already on the threads. No more CEL and it's been almost one year since the install. Good product and good price.

If you are on the fence about this light bar go for it. The quality and light output are way above the level you would expect at this price range.It have had it mounted for 2 months, I run a lot of rough dirt roads and it has not had a problem with all the bouncing and bumps.The spot portion of the light reaches out across a 300 yard field and the flood fills in about 75% of the distance of the spot beam.I get no whistle from the wind but I can tell there is a little buffeting more so on windy days, but it is mounted above my windshield so that is to be expected.

The trim on my steering wheel, speakers, center console and door handles are from a different company and they suck. This trim looks great and bends very good into awkward corners. Good color and is much thicker than the trim from another company. Doesnt hold a shape so can be test fitted and refitted if need be.

Made out of heavy duty carbon steel? I don't think so! Everything besides the bolt and nut are made out of cheap pot metal. One of the outer flanges broke in half and the bolt stripped while trying to expand a 2" exhaust pipe. Also, the POS tool got stuck in my exhaust while trying to remove it.

I don't know whether to be impressed, or disappointed here.  In polishing two cars yesterday, I used three of the pads.  The orange pad for Meguiar's #105 Ultra-Cut compond, the green for Meguiar's #205, and the red for applying Meguiar's #26 yellow wax.  The orange pad worked well enough.  The red pad seemed to soak up an awful lot of the wax--I went through almost double what I normally do.  Not good.  I used the pad off of the orbital polisher to apply wax in the tight areas, and found there was plenty of wax still in the pad.  Worse, though, was when I went to clean the pad--a *lot* of wax was still soaked into it.  Given what good wax costs, that is an incredible waste.And I should add, the included spray did nothing to get the wax out.  Even after two applications of it where I let the pad soak, it didn't make any difference.  I finally had to go into the house and use Dawn dishwashing detergent--the wax came right out!  The pad is none the worse for wear.My worst issue was with the green pad.  It worked OK for much of the vehicle, but started vibrating a bit at one point.  Finally, the pad gave out and pretty much blew itself off of the polisher.  It wasn't that warm, so it wasn't like it overheated.  A fluke? Maybe.  But I can't say I have any desire to use foam pads anymore after trying these.  I am used to other materials that hold up better (microfiber or terry cloth based bonnets or pads).

I have 2 Honda 1985 V65 Sabres that "Purr" with this stuff!!!  Great Oil, even better Value at that price.  When I do the regular valve adjustments you can feel the oil film layer that stays on moving parts that is great because most other oils drain off, over time, and parts "dry" start.  I put a lot of miles on my engines and this stuff is cheap insurance that they stay running.  Engine temps stay nice and cool and that's good for a 32 year old motorcycle.

I ordered 2 of these yesterday and got them before noon today! They are solid aluminum and come with hardware for mounting for the front emblem. It does not come with double sided 3M tape for rear the "Tailgate". The rear emblem on the tailgate is on with double sided tape, so you'll need to get your own 3M double sided tape to put it on. These are heavy duty and slightly polished and might have minor scuffs but they are packaged and have a thick clear film over the front of the package they are in. No biggie but if you have OCD like me, just use a little Mothers metal polish and you can easily and quickly get it to a mirror shine. I highly recommend this Chevy Bow Tie Emblem (Part # 96195P) 2007-2012 New Body Style Chevy Silverado1500 / 2010 New Body Style Chevy Silverado 2500 made by "AMI Billet Styling".

Very nice material used. The cover fits very snug (in a good way) on my convertible 06 350z. Nice storage bag included. The only reason I took off 1 star was we had some rain and it soaked through pretty good and held the water under it. I will be spraying it with some water proofing spray for tents. This is not enough to not recommend it though, especially for the price. I would buy again in a heart beat.176-190" is what I used for the 350z. If you buy for your Z the small WILL NOT fit. So make sure you get the 176-190.

I put this on my Ford 5.4L Triton V8.  This idler seems to be better quality than original Ford one as the original idler is made of a plastic material and this one is metal.  My original idler had movement in it when you wiggle it.  The new idler also has some loose motion in it; however, it is not significant so I assume this is normal.

It's always in the back of your mind: I hope nothing happens to me on the road today. Especially in Southern California, with it's cornucopia of, let's call them "challenged" drivers, you feel like you're taking your life in your hands every time you hit the road. And while we haven't had a major incident in over 30 years, it doesn't mean one couldn't happen to us. But if it does, we feel a little more secure with First Secure's Premium Roadside Emergency Kit.Packed to the gills with almost every conceivable thing one would need in a minor (or maybe moderate) roadside emergency, it's 90 pieces of peace of mind all in a zip-up travel case. And while the piece count is made up of many multiples like multiple zip ties and a 48-item First Aid kit, it still has plenty of stuff you always hope you never need but feel better knowing you have them. A couple of the items are things you should immediately replace with better, stronger items, such as the gloves, headlamp and multi-tool, and the compressor is nice in a pinch but could take some serious time to fully inflate tires on anything but a mid-size vehicle. But it's still nice to know those things are there in a pinch. And some items are absolutely indispensable and I'm ashamed I didn't have them in the truck before I got this kit, like the roadside triangle, the tow strap, first aid kit and the bungee cords. The only item I have a major problem with is the jumper cables. While the heavy, 6-gauge braided copper wiring seem more than adequate, the flimsy plastic handles/covers tend to slide off or just plain break apart, leaving your bare hand essentially grabbing a live wire. It's dangerous and should be redesigned or replaced immediately. I replaced them with some other jumper cables with more secure handles on the leads.At $59.95, it's a touch over priced, especially considering that almost half of the items of the entire kit are in the first aid pouch. I would also like to see a basic flashlight and some road flares, but as it stands it's a pretty decent kit. There's also something to be said about the peace of mind one gets knowing that you're covered in a great many different types of roadside emergencies. Hard to put a price on that.I received the above product(s) free of charge from First Secure. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion. My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.

I have a 2017 Mustang and one of the forst things i did was upgrade the factory speakers to some JBl Stage 601 6.5in Coaxicals. Soon after inupgraded the Exaust to an MBRP Street Cat back and the lack of a resonator caused some nasty Metal on Plastic Vibration at 1900-2100 Rpms or whenever the engine was under load. Certian songs also triggered this issue. Fast forward to these and an afternoon in the back of the car and the speakers no longer vibrate under certain rpms or when certain songs are played. I took note that these kill bass so i just cut a cookie sized hole im the bottom of the boom mat and a slit on the sode for the speaker wires and everything looks like a proper install. Super thrilled to have found these!

I just found out this item can not be returned after only three months after [purchase. Not really sure if buying online Is really a good idea. One of the shocks came apart.  Never seen this on a shock. Well Gabriel was not my first choice but Monroe didn't have something for my Frontier. So I got the Gabriel. Not a good idea. Not recommending Gabriel products from now on. Amazon should start behind products and offer some kind of guaranteed insurance thing. After all the money they are making they should. Thinking of buying less products online...

I got this last week and had concerns about whether I could install it with the main top on. I took the freedom top panels off and simply passed the looped bungie through to the back between the hardtop and the soundbar - and it worked beautifully. In just a few minutes. Thanks RR and Amazon!UPDATE: I have had this for a while and maybe used it three or four times. One of the bungees for the side roll bar appears to be slowly ripping loose. It is looking pretty thin where it is connected to the shade. We will see if it continues to thin out.

These tires came so compressed and deformed that I was afraid they would never mount properly and my concerns were echoed by the tire installer.  However, I was relieved as they mounted just fine.  I have used them for a full day of trail riding over a very diverse landscape through mud, snow, ice, rock, and sand (the San Rafael Swell in Utah).  I was totally impressed with their handling. Great traction over everything we threw at them.  This is a great value so don't be afraid to order these if you are on a budget.  I only gave them 4 stars because their appearance doesn't scream "wow".  They aren't as wide as I would like them to be and the sidewall doesn't look as protected as more expensive tires but they are totally worth the price on Amazon.  I'm very happy with my purchase, and I ride a lot!

I didn't have any of the fitment issues some have stated on here. Mine fit pretty perfectly. But seeing as how it showed up without any real packaging I could see how it could get bent during shipping. It probably took me 45 minutes from start to finish to put it on. The only reason that I took a star off is that I wish the steel wasn't fully boxed in at the base of the receiver tube. I had to cut about half an inch off of the receiver of my bike rack to be able to get the locking pin in.

Takes a bit of time and patience to install. Fits nicely. Great that it comes with an extra set in case you really screw it up.  So far, been a couple weeks with rain and blazing sun, the rear vinyl is great, the front vinyl has like a powdery white on it.  Comes off with water, but dries and is still visible to me. Most people won't notice, in picky. I would still recommend it for a cheaper mod than replacing the whole piece that still looks good.

Great little device.Pros:-customizable display (2 lines at once)-changeable backlight color-changeable backlight brightness-seems to be accurateCons:-if the car is coasting at a high speed or if you gun it, it reads 9999MPG (see picture)-AVG MPG resets each time you turn your car off, which is a huge negative if you're looking for more than immediate MPG

It worked great! Before using this product, my 2011 A4 AC smelled like something had crawled inside the evaporator and died...This worked very well! For the B8 A4, I found it was easiest to route the house through where the cabin filter is changed under the glove compartment. It's been almost three months and the smell has not come back. The trick to keeping it clean is to turn off the ac compressor and leave the fan running for a minute or two before turning the car off. This will help dry out the evaporator fins to prevent any gross build up. I attached a picture of the evaporator after using the Klima-Cleaner.

Very easy to install most time consuming part was prepping for the lights. I would have given a 5 star but the kit does not contain an inline fuse. As a guy who just went through some electrical issues with my bike I found it's cheaper to be on the safe side and use a fuse for the just in case moment. Also the colors look nice I didn't use the entire kit just 4 lights for under my tank.If your wanting to do just the engine you can do it no problem.

I bought this hoping to have it work with my 01 Honda Shadow but it would not work. The plugs are the same but the diameter is different and it would require some customizing to keep it inside. The rim of the LED headlight is much smaller than the rim on the Honda housing. There were plenty of room for the wires and the look was perfect but it just doesn't fit right in.I will hold on to it and maybe work on a custom retaining ring in the future.

I already have a set of excellent seat covers by Covercraft on my Jeep. If I'd bought the Smittybilt G.E.A.R. covers for use as a seat cover only I'd be very disappointed. They don't make great seat covers. They do cover up the middle portion of the seats but don't fit tightly. I bought them because I liked the way they look and for the additional storage.I've had stuff scattered about my 2005 Jeep Wrangler's interior and was looking to organize things better. Now I have a place to put my assorted stuff ranging from my reading and sunglasses, flashlight, tools, towels, my extra hat and suntan lotion, etc, etc. Plus it all looks cool in the bags on the rear of the seat. I'm just hoping no one steals them but I guess that's the risk you run with anything when you own a Jeep and why I have a low deductible on my insurance policy.These seats are supposedly designated for a Jeep. They say JEEP G.E.A.R. seats so I woudn't call them "universal" but I don't know specifically WHAT Jeep it's made for. It's not specifically for a 2003-06 TJ though. I got it to fit and look good in spite of the fact that it's a bit "off" in spots.For example, they have this velco strap that goes over the headrest. Good idea but why didn't they make it longer? Just another 6" of material would've made it useable. They even say that for higher backed seats you can "tuck it in" but it won't fit nearly as well. Fortunately I had a strap of nylon with velcro ends and was able to put one end around the loop and attach it to the back end of the headrest so it almost looks as if it's made for it.The strap underneath has the cover is supposed to loop through the seat and back and attach to a velcro patch on the back of the cover. I wouldn't have been able to use this because I put this G.E.A.R cover over my Covercraft seat cover and wasn't willing to cut into my cover to slot the strap under the seatback.. but even so, the strap was way too far forward and too short to do what it was supposed to do, so I don't know what Jeep seat this was made for. Smaller ones I guess.As far as installation went, it wasn't that bad. The trick is to get the cover lined up on the seatback first. The straps can be adjusted both in front and back so you can position the loop where you want it and tighten both ends. It actually worked quite well. I made it so the cover was tight. It doesn't contour to the seat back so if you are looking for a custom fit, forget it. It just sort of hangs there.Once I got the seatback cover adjusted I was able to tie down the lower seat cover easily enough. The trick is to figure out where the bungees go. The bungees are pretty poor quality. One of the hooks broke off immediately but fortunately I have a series of small bungee straps that I was able to attach to the piece of the hook that was still attached and managed to connect everything tightly. Everything seems to work and fit pretty well, I'm just how well those bungee hooks will hold up. I figure if I have to replace with my own bungee hooks I will.The seat material and bags are nice quality though. They match the black parts of my Jeep perfectly. The bags attach easily enough to the back as well as to the front and sides of the seats. There are 7 different sized bags. One bag is a bit bizarre in that it opens to the side..why didn't they just have it open on top? I just stuffed my towels in that one. The others are pretty functional. I have yet to fill them all.All in all, I'm pretty pleased with it. I don't know how well it will hold up over time. The cover is a bit looser than I'd like on the lower seat and I'm wondering how long those bungee hooks will last. $100 is a bit steep for one seat cover. I think for the price and quality of this cover you should at least get 2 covers.If you are looking for a seat cover that fits like a glove and for protection I'd look elsewhere. If you want something that will provide extra storage and add a bit of style to your Jeep then I'd recommend the Smittybilt G.E.A.R. seat cover.

Awesome tires. I was somewhat hesitant to go with LT tires on my F150 from prior experience. I had LT tires on a '87 along with HD shocks that rode like a buckboard, they were load E. Fast forward 5 generations of trucks and they have all had P tires which rode smooth and offered decent mileage and good handling in non-winter conditions. When winter comes here in the upper midwest I have always cringed. Should I buy a set of dedicated winter tires? Where would I store them? Kind of a pain switching them out annually and worried about burning tread down for the days of no snow and clear roads which are more numerous than the "snow" days.A dilemma, I want decent traction in all driving conditions, clear, snow, rain, mud without having to switch tires.I weigh the options and find their are 2 or 3 tire manufacturer's which offer A/T tires with the snowflake symbol (aka RMA rated winter tires). Ah, what to chose now? I find Cooper, Firestone and BFG which I have always wanted to try, but was concerned with a harsh stiff ride and noise.That leads to my review of the BFG A/T T/A KO2 which I had purchased. My fears of a buckboard ride were unfounded. These tires ride better than the highway all season tread they replaced. Noise? Quieter than the highway all season tread they replaced. Cornering is much improved with a much better "road feel" than on my P rate all season highway tires.I have not been able to test them in winter conditions but am anticipating it for the first time. I feel confident these tires will deliver, and will post up a review when the snow does fly.As for now, these new BFG's make my truck feel new, even though it is 7 years old. Ride is fantastic, cornering much improved (stiffer sidewall) and are not noticeably noisy. I am expecting a slight mileage drop due to this tire being 7lbs heavier and the amazing grip. I will report the difference I've experienced.I hope this helps in your tire buying decision. I am as so far a satisfied BFG customer after riding on several other tires on my trucks (Michelin, Firestone, Hankook, Continental, Yokohama, Goodyear, Bridgestone, General and others (I've been driving awhile).One year update:Tires are still performing as good as when I had the put on a year ago. Very predictable and assured driving in all types of winter conditions from heavy slush to light snow and hard pack. They pull right through the heavy stuff and it is hard to break them loose of grip.Sand, gravel and rocky terrain are now no sweat to drive.Wear has been minimal, and I have rotated the tires once.

Great device, I use it in a way it wasn't designed for, however it covers my needs well.  I use it in the front of my truck to carry Kayaks with a 5th wheel.  It's solid, takes the weight extremely well.  I'm much happier with it than I am with the Thule setup to hold load bars into my truck.  Since going to this I've had less issues with my bars moving.

I cleaned two and a half year old tires which are kept outside in all sorts of Chicago weather. Never cleaned with anything other than normal car washes. Turned out really well. Smells like bubble gum

This saved my car!  I had the engine bay painted at a body shop and they managed to get a lot of overspray on the car.  This clay bar saved the day, no problems at all.  I won an award at a car show the day after using this.

How can it be cheaper to have this shipped to my door then buying at the store ill never fully understand but its wonderful! First I checked the fitment on my lowes brand 5x8 and then I mounted it to the side! I'm super happy about the quality and that I now have a spare tire.

How can you go wrong for so cheap? You can buy 10 of these for the price of a rigid. It installed very cleanly on my Grizzly 660 and puts out an intense white light making the stock headlights look like soft yellow weak bulbs. No more out-running the headlights at night. My concern is the longevity of it... so time will tell. But again, how can you go wrong for so cheap?BTW I recommend getting the wiring harness... it makes it very easy to install/wire and has a clean look when done.

Once you get used to it and adjusted, this foam cannon is amazing. I love the honeydew snow foam soap with it and always use this cannon anytime I get my pressure washer out to wash a vehicle.

These are wonderful! Only minor bug was that while identical to the Craftsman versions, they are shorter and can't quite get a few socket set to fit on these in entirety while the Craftsmans DO hold the longer sets.

I installed this in front of my Cummins thats connected to my block heater. The factory plug in was a pain connecting to each day and the NOCO port made plugging into the truck so much easier. Highly recommend to anyone that needs a waterproof 125v port.

I ordered this to cover up the only Chrome on my 2014 Edge sport. So far everything has been sticking and working fantastic. Extremely close match to the stock Grill, only way you can tell the difference is if you put them directly side by side. Definitely recommended using a hair dryer or heat gun when bending around tight Corners to ensure solid fit.

I couldn't be happier with these lights. It's so nice finally been able to see in the back of my SUV before the lights were so damn I could never find anything.  Installed these in 2010 Range Rover sport it didn't put up any air codes and none of them seem to flash if for some reason that changes I'll update my review.

Excellent tool, I don't even consider using a screwdriver or additional spark plug to test coils, a real test anymore. Coils sometimes like to get weak over time, and cause occasional misfires. You can't really test if it's 20% weaker than its supposed to be. It will still appear to be a good spark. Unless you use the OTC spark tester, it requires the coil to output a much higher voltage. Similar to under high load conditions. Sounds like I'm trying to sell this tool, but it saved me a lot of time today on a Ford 5.4 with 4 coils that didn't pass on the tester. They all had decent spark but not enough apparently. Replaced all 4 of the ones that tested bad, and now it runs great. There's no other way I would have known that.The only issue I've had with it is the end that snaps into the spark plug wire kept unscrewing over time, a little loctite should keep it in place though. Also the porcelain can get dirty, I use brake cleaner and a clean paper towel or q-tip to wipe it clean again.I bought this about 2 years ago, it's helped me a lot but really saved me today. I paid $13.84 here on Amazon. Paid for itself over and over.

You get what you pay for, as always, with this product for sure.  It is not nearly as quality as the pictures show.  The "Carbon Fiber" look is just painted on dots, most of mine are round silver dots on a black background, they aren't even rectangular to look more like carbon fiber.  Not terrible, I have never purchased or installed one of these before, but was hoping for higher quality than I received, but did not expect more for the price it is ok, and I will use it.  Hopefully the adhesive is better than the printing.  See my pictures for a true representation.

This is the third time that Ive tried to get this part and Ive yet to get what I want. The first time I thought there was a mistake in my order fulfillment and just ordered another one and kept the wrong one to have a spare part for the future. The second time I thought that perhaps they have the part numbers mixed up, so I ordered the other one. This is the third time and now I am pulling my hair out. They are all the same part and none of them are what I need. The picture for part number for 17910.02 is what I need, but not what was delivered twice. The picture and part delivered for part number 17910.01 is exactly what you should expect based on the picture. You can see in the attached picture that I have one opened and two still in the package and they are all the same, yet the part numbers are different.

They fit and they match!! I have a 2006 GMC 1500 with the extended cab. My year truck was smack dab in the middle of what would and what wouldn't fit. The key is the rims. According to the original window sticker, mine are "chrome-styled steel wheels". Obviously 6 lugs. Well pleased indeed! Now, if I don't run into another person who needs them more than I do!

Great tool for the hobbyist!  I totally love this thing.  I really like that you can just probe and see if there is voltage or a ground.  I absolutely love that you can through a ground or voltage to the circuit with the flip of the switch.  It ended up helping me today troubleshoot a back up camera I was installing on my wifes truck.  I hooked the whole system must to find out it was dead. I used the voltmeter and verified I had no voltage coming up to the head unit.  I used the power probe to throw 12vdc to the back on the radio on the reverse wire, which also gave power to the camera.  The camera came on and the display changed to the back up camera.  This told me I had no power.  I went back to the back of the truck and fixed that issue.  Then tried the system again found it was getting power, the head unit would switch to the camera but I had no video display.  Probed around and found out I was missing the ground now.  Made the troubleshooting super fast and a lot of fun.  I also like the two LED's at the business in of the probe, they put out a lot of light, right were you want it, very handy!  I cant wait to use it again.  I wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money of this since I had a very nice Fluke Voltmeterand I figured I could do pretty much everything I needed without buying this unitI am so glad I did buy it, and would buy it again.

Awesome running boards, with some notes that I haven't seen in the many other reviews I've read.  See attached pics for reference.I installed these on a 2010 Ram 1500 crew cab that I just purchased.  I needed something for my young kids, wife and elderly mother to get in and out easier.  After many hours of research I went with these cause I liked the full rubberized top, the 4" stepping surface and the aluminum material, which should hold up better than steel ones.A few notes:These rails can be installed two ways.  There are three equally separated hole locations on the bottom to attach to the brackets.  There is a "short" end and there is a "long" end.  I intend to install mud flaps to help protect not only my paint but the rails themselves, however in my research no one mentions this little fact, and the pictures I saw varied in how they sat against the front wheel well.  Some pictures showed them go into the well deep enough that you couldn't put on mud flaps, others showed it stop short.  In my pics you'll see that if you install with the short end forward, there is plenty of room to install flaps, and the nice part is that the extended piece on the back allows you a one-foot step up to get at the back of the bed near the cab.On 2009 and 2010 Ram 1500 models, you will need to drill two holes into the seam weld to brace the front driver's side bracket.  I can tell you that this is by far the worst part of the install.  After mounting and leveling the brackets and rails, I drilled a small pilot hole from the inside of the seam weld to the outside.  Then, I used a 1 foot long 1/4 inch bit and a high powered corded drill to drill the holes back through from the outside.  This alone took over 30 minutes, that is not an easy hole to drill.  When done, I had to clean up the metal on the inside with a dremel before mounting the brace to the bracket.  Even though not included (not sure why), I think I'm going to finish off the driver's front bracket with the second set of washer/locking washer/nut just for added support.  I think I'm also going to take off the brace and put a gob of grease in between the washers to prevent the new holes I put in the body from rusting.Last note, I was shorted one bolt for the rail attachment to the brackets, which required a home depot run.  All in all the install took me about 3.5 hours, and was a pain in the 90 degree heat, but I am very pleased with the end results.  The rail is sturdy and has no problem handling me at 6 foot 2 and 240 pounds.  It barely moves.  Now that I see the rail allows for mudflaps, I placed my order today.Hope this helps you make a decision, if you aren't afraid of doing some work, go for these rails.UPDATE 7/14/16:I installed the mudflaps I ordered (also from amazon, https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AX7O5XM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which I would HIGHLY suggest, and have attached an updated pic of the front drivers side for reference.

I purchased 2 of these and I have to say they absolutely help with the bouncing of the trailer. I put one in the rear and one at the front. I may purchase one more to put on the slide out as It will be tall enough to reach it. I got through a nights sleep with out feeling my kids toss and turn all night.  I absolutely recommend this product to help with stabilizing your camper.

Amazing lights! Crazy bright. Installation was straight forward, hardest part was getting to the lights without taking off the bumper (did not have the correct tools to do it). They are plug and play to use the "fog light" aspect of them but if you want the halos to work, you need to wire them to a hot wire. I wired them to the blinker lights so the halos turn on when I have the parking lights on. Check out "Spare Time Videos" on youtube for great instructions. Overall very satisfied with the lights.

This cover arrived on time and in good condition.  The fabric is heavy and waterproof.  Once you figure out how to put it on, it goes on the bikes easily, especially if you have a helper.  There is lots of room for my two expensive mountain bikes on the Thule bike rack.  The cover even zips around at the bottom and a velcroed pocket with a draw string covers the hitch bar.  The bikes are totally protected from dust, water and prying eyes.  The fabric seems heavy enough to not flop around in the wind while traveling.  Some have had concern about the cover interfering with the tail lights.  Probably an issue for some vehicles but on my truck or trailer the tail lights are wide enough apart that it is not an issue for me.  I will have additional information once we use it on the road.  Taking a 1700 mile trip and that should test the durability of the cover.  So far I highly recommend this cover and the price is very reasonable for a cover of this quality.

Product was obviously pre opened. It is the item mentioned but I would rather go to the parts store and pay $20 for a well packaged new item.The box for the item was in bad condition and the item was in a plastic bag and loose. I fixed the box to open. Just odd for I love Amazon but run into items like this once in a while.

Just a preliminary review, I just put it on yesterday. 1st, the instructions say two hours for install, with the exception of minimal help getting the hardtop off and at the end putting the new ragtop on, it was closer to 4 hours. Not a big thing, I had figured it would take longer for a 1st attempt, especially since  I was going back and forth between the Bestop video and the printed instructions. The printed instructions helped, but it's all pictures and very little actual printed instruction it really did require the video for help. My impression is, it is as quiet as the hardtop was, now if it stays as dry I'll be very happy. One thing I really like so far is the visibility out the rear window is way better than on the standard hardtop thanks to the rear window wiper. The Sunrider is very easy to open and much more convenient than the Freedom hardtops. Overall after one day I'm very happy. Waiting for the 1st rain to evaluate that.

Got the item today. Box had previously been opened and light stuffed back in. Looks like it was a return based on the scratch marks on the frame and glass. I read in the reviews that it leaks sometimes.  It's no wonder as there are obvious gaps in between the frame housing and the glass! I'll update my review once I get it hooked up and see if it actually works.

I bought this tool after a stout three-jaw slide hammer did not move the very snug balancer on my Mercruiser 350.  I thought rust was the culprit since so much is visible on this motor. I sought out a puller with a sturdy (i.e, not a simple casting) plate and a fat lead screw with fine threads.  This unit also boasts a nice thrust bearing for even less friction under load. The included parts fit the rather ordinary Mercruiser/GMC just fine, although I used my own three bolts to attach the puller plate to the balancer to get maximum thread engagement.  After I was done, I noticed three bolts under the foam liner on the lid side of the plastic storage case that probably would have fit fine.I carefully assembled the puller on the the motor, sprayed on a little Kroil to lube the lead screw and pulled the pulley right off.  No drama and with a decent, but not excessive. tug on the 1 1/2 foot long wrench.  In contrast the the 'one star' reviewer that wanted a coarse pitch lead screw to get the balancer off 'faster', the leverage of the fine pitch was just the ticket for me.  With the balancer off, the mating surfaces looked shiny and nice so I guess the stuck was just due to tolerances.  At least I now have a very nice tool to gently reinstall it!The only bother, but not enough to remove a star, is that the storage box is designed to only hold the included parts.  I had to just stick my own bolts in a random finger groove to keep them with the set.

Shipped fast, strong, opens up wide and extend very tall, good quality steel, powder coating, and reflective stickers.  I don't open it up in any direction and it's perfect height to my headache rack (backrack 145LV w/1" raised from normal height for bed cover).You will definitely need to find a good way to tension it left and right to your vehicle it will sway 4-6" if not.I use on my truck where I can also tow a travel trailer, I have a bed cover to ladder racks were not ideal. It's a great set up... the warning/marker flag is cheap, haven't used it, but wouldn't expect it to last one long trip without falling apart.

This is the third set I've purchased from this seller and for good reason. Excellent value for the money ! Now all of are vehicles have them to protect the original interior. I do recommend buying a can of scotch guard and spraying then good to give then some water and stain resistance. Although for the price who cares. Good quality and great price.

Item came well packaged and worked as advertised. Bought these motors to replace a bad door lock/latch mechanism on my 2010 Prius. The length on the shaft is 20mm which was needed. Though you have grind a flat side of the shaft to fit the plastic worm gear. The first motor was nice and snug, the second motor was on the loose side but there were no issues. The only major issues I had was once installed, the polarity was backward. When you hit lock, the door unlock, and vice versa. I spent a good amount of time taking the assembly apart just to see what I did wrong. But it wasn't installer error. To save yourself the headache and taking the latch assembly apart. Test it first before you button everything back up.I end up swapping the two thicker wires on the plug that goes to the latch assembly. Overall it beats paying $260 from the dealer when you can fix it for about $5.00 and an hour or so.

I had three people approach me in one day complimenting on how shiny my truck was, now I do maintain my truck weekly, but since using this I've gotten a lot of compliments on the shine. It doesn't take much about two shot glasses per five gallons and the suds stay foamy. For tires and wheels, I use store brand cheap soap and the foamy suds break down quickly, a total difference you see with this product.A lot of people in the detailing business give CG a hard time because of them being mostly over-hyped marketing using fancy keywords and too many products. So far for driveway and taking care of your own ride, most of their stuff is pretty good.

I purchased the KFI contactor to replace a Warn contactor on a Arctic Cat.... the KFI  contactor has 2 wires coming off of it that connects to the winch switch harness, the 3rd wire is grounded to the KFI connector.... as can be seen in photos below my Arctic Cat had 3 wires.No problem for anyone wanting to replace a 3 wire contactor with the KFI contactor for less than half the price.In pic # 1 you can see where I cut the 3 wires from my Warn contactor so I could splice into the KFI contactor and keep my original winch switch harness connecter in case I need to replace my winch switch in the future - easy plug and play...In the 2nd pic, I cut the ground wire from the harness as it is not needed as mentioned earlier because the KFI contactor is grounded to itself. I cut the KFI wire connectors off and spliced wires together, soldered and applied heat shrink as can be seen in pic # 3... best if you use the waterproof heat shrinkIn my case, green to green wires connected together and black to blue, if your winch pays in while depressing out on switch, you can correct by either swapping the green to black and blue to green or switching the yellow and gray cables at the motor connectors...Basically, I twisted wires together while letting contactor hang as seen in photos , then tested for proper operation before soldering wires. Make sure you disconnect negative terminal of battery after testing for proper operation to prevent damaging the contractor during installation..One last note, the KFI mounting holes did not match up to the Warn hole configuration, so I installed one bolt to hold contactor in place on mounting bracket and drilled a new hole in bracket through the other contactor mounting holeNot sure how to tell if your contactor is bad? If you're not hearing an audible click whenever you press both in and out on winch switch you have an issue... first ensure all your connectors are tight and free of corrosion.... if you hear an audible click on both the in and out - the contactor is working and you have issue with winch.No audible click - check switch by disconnecting or back probe with a volt ohm meter and check for 12vdc on both wires while key is on and switch depressed to on and out. If you have voltage the switch and harness are good.. To check motor, search for video on Youtube using jumper cables..Saved like $50 going with the KFI contactor instead of Warn...

This stuff is just the industry standard for trim paint. It's the perfect color, texture, and sheen to freshen up the black bumper and window trim on any old car, and it lasts forever. It's expensive as far as spray paint goes but man does it work. I'm adding a photo of my old Mustang, and every black piece of trim you see was painted with this exact paint. I can't say enough good things about it.

Seems to do the job! I bought the inline oiler separate as there appears to be issues buying this with the oiler pre attached. Had to order 2 1/4" ntp adapters as well.

This tail light made all the difference on how my cbr250r looks. Plus its very bright that when i signal or press the brake it catches the drivers attention especially at night. I didn't have any trouble getting the sequential signals or the brake flash to work because I kept the front turn signal light bulbs stock instead of LED eliminating the need for hyper flash resistors.

UPDATE: THIS BURNED UP THE 4TH TIME USED.NOT WORTH THE MONEY!I have had a few days to check this nice little power pack out and it works well with smaller cars and suv's, I was excited when I read that it could jump a diesel but if you have a full size pickup or diesel that is 18v it will not work only smaller cars like a vw diesel so disapointing but it works great on smaller cars I used it to charge my phone and it has a nice light, I also wanted to mention that it comes with the wall charger as well before buying this one I looked up several others that showed they came with chargers but did not, after looking in the reviews, it also comes with some other cords and a good case it looks like a cd case, the whole thing is small enough to just throw anywhere and go, overall you get what you pay for.  This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.

So far, so good. I wanted a slightly blue color to give it more of a custom look without sacrificing performance. The 8K-55W was exactly what I was looking for. The ballast and bulbs feel like they are made of good quality and the plugs all matched up to my factory harness just fine.

Super easy install, Curt hits it out of the park (fits better than my neighbor's who went to Toyota for his) perfect for attaching my superbumper safety device when I'm not towing. (Tight fit with spare but works great)

I finally got mine!  It seemed like it took forever, but that is because it was coming from china!  It took my husband and I about 2 1/2 hours to get these on my Honda Civic, but we finally got it done.  We had to cut a slit in the back seat cover where the seat belt buckles come through.  It doesn't look like the other people who reviewed this had to do that, but for a 2015 Honda Civic, you will have to do this.  My husband was very careful while doing this though as to not tear it.  We also had to put a hole where the head rest go like everyone else had to do also.  Other than this, everything else went well.  We had to take out my back seat in order to put the seat cover on, which was not fun, but it was the easiest way to do this.  Once we got it all in it looks really nice.  Unless you are really paying attention, you won't be able to recognize that it seat covers.  I am happy with this purchase.  I just wish it came with instructions, but being as we had already put in seat covers once on my car, we already had an idea how this worked.  If we had not done this before, which they came with instructions, we would have had a hard time figuring some of this out.  This is why this is only getting four stars.  I definitely think this should come with instructions!

I own a 2004 F350 Diesel, this is the third filter I replaced.  The latest one lasted nine months before I had to replace it. Works great with the Sinister Diesel. Easy to install, worth it.  (All I do is Touch the blue house to see if its hot, if it isn't I replace the filter.)

This is a replacement for an existing Fan-Tastic automatic fan in the bathroom.  We did not like the automatic feature so decided to change the fan.  The new fan moves alot of air, actually too much on the lowest speed.  It mounts in the same hole in the roof, but the screw holes are different.  The motor was quite noisy; a high pitched squeal.  I called Fan-Tasstic and explained the problem.  They sent a replacement motor immediately.  There was a little work involved in replacing the motor but the end result is that it is quieter than the first motor.  It seems that Fan-Tastic changed motor suppliers so don't expect the new fans to be as quiet as the old ones (or as quiet as advertised), and no you can't use the old motor on a new fan, the mounts are different.  Overall I'm satisfied with this fan, but Fan-Tastic needs to do something about the noisy motors.  I also want to replace the fan in the living room but will wait a few years and hopefully Fan-Tastic will have addressed the noise problem by then.

these 12v led lamps are a great replacement for the old incandescent-style lamps in your car's interior lights. the led light is quite a bit "cooler" in color temperature, which provides a much truer color than the yellow-ish glow that the old lamps give off. their brightness is better than the old style lamps as well. the size is juuuuust a bit larger in diameter than the old lamps, which might cause you a bit of extra work installing them into tight spaces, but the base fits just as well as with the older incandescents.i had already installed another brand of led lights into one of my vehicles, so i swapped one of those out with one of these just to compare performance. you can see in the attached photo that the one on the right is slightly brighter than the one on the left. on the right is the yorkim, and on the left is another highly-reviewed brand on amazon, "only". yorkim wins the brightness test!these led lamps are a great replacement for the older, dimmer, and possibly even blown out lights in your car or truck. the 10-pack provides you enough to redo the entire interior of your vehicle, and probably leaves a few spares as well. the price isn't the best you can find on amazon, but this is one of those cases where you get what you pay for. i've yet to see another 194 led lamp outperform these. give them a shot! keep in mind though, that some vehicles will not operate these lamps correctly unless you add a resistor to the circuit to "load" the circuit correctly. i didn't have this problem with my '03 silverado, but my '04 jeep did.disclaimer: i was provided a complimentary product from the seller, in exchange for an honest review.

You can get a preview of what these horns sound like from YouTube, but basically they sound like a domestic car.As Tom A. Rider says, these horns have only a single spade connector, which means the horns are always grounded and are fed power via the horn button. These horns draw less than 10 amps. Thus they can be "plug and play" for cars which have a single wire connected to their OEM horn and if they already use a 10 amp or larger fuse for their horn.HOWEVER, as Robotic says, you CAN use these horns on cars with two wires connected to the OEM horn, by using the included relay. Fiamm describes this via a tiny diagram in their packaging: - connect relay terminals 85 and 86 to your OEM horn wires (polarity doesn't matter, because these terminals simply energize the relay's coil) - connect relay terminal 30 to a feed wire with a 10 amp fuse inline fuse (not included) and feed this line from a constant +12v source (like from the car battery) - connect relay terminal(s) 87 to the Fiamm horns with more wire (not included) - mount the Fiamm horns to your car, ensuring good ground contact at the mount pointsUsing the included red covers and/or the silver grills is optional. It's a good idea to mount the trumpet outlets pointing somewhat downwards to allow drainage and prevent moisture from pooling inside the trumpets.These horms are a good value and they sound good too!

Installation kit comes with a control box and is fused for 20A. White light will be approximately 24W. Yellow light will be approximately 10W.  Keep in mind that these lights are typically installed in pairs, so you will need to double those numbers.  The advantage to installing 2 smaller light bars, as opposed to a large 52" light bar, is that you can aim 2 smaller lights in different directions.  High, low, left, right: so that you can illuminate what you need to see.To put that into perspective, your halogen headlights are 55W, halogen high beam are 65W, and those old, big, round off-road lights which were so popular back in the 70's are 100W.Watts - the amount of energy a light bulb uses. LEDs have a lower wattage than incandescent bulbs, but emit the same light output.40 Watt incandescent lamp produces only 380-460 lumens and uses 40 Watts of energy per hour.100 Watt incandescent lamp produces 1700  1800 lumens and uses 100 Watts of energy per hour.Direct sunlight is around 100k lumens and uses no amount of energy per hour.A 40 Watt incandescent is now replaced with a 9 Watt CFL or a 4 Watt LEDA 60 Watt incandescent is now replaced with a 13 Watt CFL or a 7 Watt LEDA 100 Watt incandescent is now replaced with a 32 Watt CFL or a 15 Watt LEDA lumen is the amount of light a certain lamp gives off. If replacing a standard 150 Watt light bulb which gives off around 2600 Lumens, using a 42 Watt CFL or a 25 Watt LED is about the equivalent. This lowers the needed power of the light by over a quarter of the required power to produce the same light. A 70 Watt LED fixture can produce 7000 Lumens or more and replace most highway and parking lot lighting fixtures to a more efficient and cost effecting light. This is becoming more efficient every day.Wiring harness integrates a remote control, and a control box designed to dissipate heat and cool. Fused for 20A. Ring terminals and disconnects are pre connected and insulated. Multiple attachment angles are possible with the mounting kit.Candela is the base measurement for describing luminous intensity. It tells you how bright the light source is which shows how far away from an object you can be and while still being able to see it. Any light source eventually becomes too dim to see the further away you are. This is different from lumens (a total light output) because its the value of light intensity from any point in a single direction from the light source. Laser pointers or spot lights have the highest candela rating since the majority of their light is focused in a single direction. A simple comparison is that 1 candela is roughly equivalent to the light from a single candle. If you have a light bulb generating 1 cd and block part of the light, every direction not obscured still produces 1 cd. This is because the same intensity of light can be seen from any non-obscured direction at the same distance.Lux (lx) measures illuminance, which is the amount of light on a surface per unit area. A single lux is equal to one lumen per square meter. If the lamp displays its brightness as a measurement of lux, it usually lists a distance from the bulb since any change in distance or bulb type changes the lux level. As an example, if you place a 100 lumen bulb in a flood light that shines on only one square meter of surface, that surface will be lit at 100 lx. However, if you back the flood light away to shine on four square meters, the surface is now lit with 25 lx.Luminous flux differs from power (radiant flux) in that radiant flux includes all electromagnetic waves emitted, while luminous flux is weighted according to a model (a "luminosity function") of the human eye's sensitivity to various wavelengths. Lumens are related to lux in that one lux is one lumen per square meter.The lumen is defined in relation to the candela as1 lm = 1 cd  sr.A full sphere has a solid angle of 4 steradians, so a light source that uniformly radiates one candela in all directions has a total luminous flux of 1 cd  4 sr = 4 cdsr  12.57 lumens. The SI unit of luminous flux is the lumen (lm). One lumen is defined as the luminous flux of light produced by a light source that emits one candela of luminous intensity over a solid angle of one steradian. In other systems of units, luminous flux may have units of power.The three primary types of color temperature for light bulbs are: Soft White (2700K  3000K), Bright White/Cool White (3500K  4100K), and Daylight (5000K  6500K). The higher the Degrees Kelvin, the whiter the color temperature.Color temperature is conventionally expressed in kelvin, using the symbol K, a unit of measure for absolute temperature. Color temperatures over 5000 K are called "cool colors" (bluish white), while lower color temperatures (27003000 K) are called "warm colors" (yellowish white through red). "Warm" in this context is an analogy to radiated heat flux of traditional incandescent lighting rather than temperature. The spectral peak of warm-coloured light is closer to infrared, and most natural warm-coloured light sources emit significant infrared radiation. The fact that "warm" lighting in this sense actually has a "cooler" color temperature often leads to confusionKit for installation will still require self tapping, self threading, metal screws, wiring disconnects, solder, heat shrink, split loom, cable ties, and of course, plenty of electrical tape. You will need a drill, wire strippers, a crimping tool, a soldering iron, a heat gun, your vehicle's factory service manual, and basic knowledge of your car's electrical system.Remote operated kit can short out internally. Remote control batteries can fail. Electrical interference may block remote control's RF signal to control box. All of this can be bypassed by way of manual switching.Lamps may also be installed with manual switching. Wiring lamps directly to power source, without harness and control box, the lamps draw a heavier load, so fuse accordingly. By switching manually, you will lose the strobe and flashing features. Manual switching will only allow for turning the lights on and off, and selecting the Kelvin temperature. Lamps have red, black, and white wires. Red = Power. Black = White Light. White = Yellow Light. This unit is designed for ground side switching. Color temperature will change with the selection of ground wires. You can accomplish this with a fused positive connection and a SINGLE POLE DOUBLE THROW switch.Plan your installation. Determine best mounting location with considerations for access points, wiring, type of hardware to be used, and actual illumination. Keep in mind that you will want to install behind the bumper, in a location where if someone backs into your car while parallel parking, they don't knock your lamps off. A higher mounting point provides greater visibility. A mounting point closer to the ground will illuminate more of the roadway. Rear facing installations allow you to see your truck bed, will provide a well lit work space behind your truck or van, and can provide a flashing strobe warning light for vehicles approaching from behind.Turn your head, look out your window. Can you see down that alley on your left or right? Mount these lamps on your roof, 6" forward of the B-Pillar, and now you have "alley lights" Also useful when the sun has gone down, and you're still field dressing your organically harvested protein.Mount the base to a magnet, and these lights can be mounted on any metal surface without drilling, and moved about to suit your needs.Remember that this is a direct current application. Always use due precautions when working with live current. Do not allow yourself to be a part of the circuit. Disconnect the vehicle battery and remove fuse from harness prior to starting work. Use personal protective equipment. And when working with electricity, wear the proper insulated safety shoes and arc flash suit.

You may be thinking this looks a lot like the Draw-tite hitch, but you probably think it must be a knock off since it's half the price. Well, it is literally the Draw-tite hitch with a sticker over the logo!So with that in mind, it's as others have mentioned: simple to attach - thirty minutes really is a reasonable estimate - and sturdy. This comes with four bolts and washers. They are the exact same length as the OEM bolts you remove (plenty long enough), and they're grade 10. Not sure what the grade of the OEM bolts are, so I used those provided. With the drawbar removed, you don't even see the hitch underneath the bumper.

Figured after using a $50 Wheelskins cover and have great luck with it I would give this cheap cover a try. Let me tell you, I regret going cheap. Before I even threaded the first hole the string started to fray and bunch up. Thankfully they supplied two separate strings so I removed the frayed one and started again. This time I got through about 10 holes and things were going great until the string broke with not a whole lot of force being applied to it. When I used the Wheelskins cover I used two hands to pull that string as tight as humanly possible and it never broke AND the string came pre-waxed. The string provided with this cheap cover was not waxed. Take my advice and spend a little extra money on a better wheel cover so your not disappointed like I am.

Wanting a hitch on our new 2018 JK Willys one wasn't installed when purchased and found oem option was $495.  Off to Amazon I went and found this.Probably one of the best quality, packaged items I've purchased on Amazon and installation couldn't have been easier.  Extremely pleased with the product and hats off to Tyger for supplying such a quality product at such a reasonable price.Didn't have to drop muffler or anything.  Tricky getting nuts on 2 middle bolts but duct tape on end of screwdriver fixed that.

I bought this to upgrade my tail/brake lights on a Toyota Camry. These are double filament bulbs. This comes two in a package. When all the diodes are lit, there's no doubt it is super bright. However, both bulbs were defective. One bulb was on at it's  brightest at all times. So, it didn't get get dimmer or bright when I stepped on the brakes or not. The other bulb was always dim and not all the diodes were lit. I put the original bulbs back and will return these LED. I emailed the seller, Hot Light Team, for advise and they sent me a pair. Both worked fine but after 2 weeks the passenger bulb is dead. I will have to find a better quality bulb.

I ordered this keychain so it would go along with my Honda lanyard.  It is slightly on the heavy side, but I like the fact that it is solid.  I have dropped and thrown this keychain  around several times on purpose as well as put it in my pocket daily with my lanyard.  It has some scratches, but has not chipped or dented.  I wish it was just a little bit lighter though.Pros: Chrome, Cold to the touch, Durable.Cons: Slightly heavy.Overall, if you love Honda's, then you'll love this.

Hello all, I figured I would put in my 2 cents on this product.  Well this weekend I detailed 2 of my vehicles I am selling  - so I spent A LOT of time into them.  On a blemish free paint job this product works fantastic!  On a blemished or in my case clear coat peel part of my Avalanche - it doesnt work worth a darn! I had to re do the whole truck with an old polish I have been using for 20+ years (Nu Finish).  Now on my car - it looks great......its a clean car for 1995!  My verdict is - get it if your paint is clean - if not - move to a wax n buff product.

Bought this for my 2500. As you can see from the picture this new part is very thin. I would say this is for a 1500 but not for a 2500 or 3500. It does save itself by having two ports for another smaller radiator but it would justify the savings of not initially buying a 2500/3500 radiator.Fitment is spot on and the product seems well built. Leaving statement: this is perfect for a 1500 but nothing bigger

Bars came well packaged, and faster than anticipated.Fit my 2014 CR-V without issue.Installation is straight forward but will take a little longer to install as the mounts will need to be adjusted to match the width of the rails.  Best to unscrew the one sides cover plate with a Phillips hard screw driver, screw one hole on one side and gage what final length adjustment is needed for a good matching fit.Have not judged for noise at high speed, nor mounted kayak rack as of yet. Will update if any detrimental items come up.

Every couple of months I have to change the low beam light bulb in our Prius. It's an issue that Toyota has never resolved on the model. The voltage regulator allows spikes in the 12 volt system which burns out the bulbs.I decided to install a set of JDM ASTAR 8th Generation LED Headlight bulbs. Wow! What a difference in the intensity. Since the LED lights have their own internal voltage regulator and is good from 12 to 24 volts the inherent problem should be resolved.The pictures show the difference between a "normal" halogen H11 bulb and the LED's.  Installation was a breeze and it's well designed model.I would highly recommend.

bought this plus the tint kit by BM for my 98 explorer xl. my intentions was to do the front window "eye brow" but after two attempts alone i gave up. later on i decided to try my trunk/cargo windows because they don't move and i don't have to make cuts for stuff in the way. for instance my front window i had to make cuts for my rear view mirror and my remote start antenna. was not happening. anywho, i watched a couple videos on youtube, mostly on pre-cut tints but i din't want to spend $$$ on them so i picked up BM tint at local walmart. i didn't bother with the instructions i just did what i had seen in the videos.1)spray down the window (the kit includes water/soap solution)2)use blade(not theirs, it scratched my window. try 1inch straight edge) to scrape window clean. and squeegee3)repeat #24)liberally spray window with solution5)apply and cut6)leave tint on window. go inside vehicle and do steps 1-37)remove film off the tint (very hard, very thin film)8)go inside your vehicle and apply tint, move around to get good fit, make other necessary trims to tint. spray solution as necessary.9) start from the middle of window and squeegee outward. then squeegee straight out(left or right) and then downward and upward. following this is key to minimizing bubbles as much as possible. you can lift tint up and spray solution on to keep it slippery and movable.i'd also like to note im a newbie at this but following those steps plus watching some DIY videos i was able to do it. one roll won't go very far but, one roll was enough for me to mess up twice on my front window and then do one of my trunk windows. this is a very slow process that requires patience, rush and you'll f%$# it up.

The 31 mm Cree 5W LED by Yorkim are very well designed.  They can be installed either way, where most leds must be installed a specific way.  The heat sink is large and much needed as they get hot quickly, but the light output is amazing!This item was shipped extremely fast and am very happy with my purchase.  I received this item at a promotional discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

Replace them together, don't just do one then walk away.This is the full assembly to replace the one currently on your car.No need to swap parts within the assembly, just one whole piece.My front right was leaking after 94k miles so I decided to get them both replaced.You are going to need to unplug your battery, just one cable pull will do.The ABS cable needs to be unplugged during install.If you forget to uplung the battery, to reset the ABS and possibly DSC(looks like a car on a crooked road) after the work is done, just drive for like 20secs and that should do it.Alright, I think that is all the assist I can offer.The car does sit a little high, like about an inch or so maybe less. No big deal, it handles goooooood now, the height will adjust in the coming weeks.I've got some before photos and after below.172264 is the front left172263 is the front right.

Awesome ladder. I installed it on a 2017 RAM 1500 Tradesman. Installing it in this type of truck is not that hard just a bit tricking trying to keep enough of the plate secured to the tailgate cover and drilling some extra wholes. I also had to add a make shift securing hook for it and installed the strap a different way from what the instructions said.

I bought these from the seller about 8 months ago. I also had to re sodder the connection on 1 of the rings cause it was emitting a different color than the other 3. Just had to change around the blue and green. Not a huge deal. The huge deal is that 2 are still working fine. 1 is missing 2 blue and 2 red leds that have burned out, cause they all worked out of the box. The final 1, is missing like 6 blue and 2 red. Wouldnt be a big deal if i didn't have to remove the bumper, remove my hid lights bake open my headlights again, remove and replace the faulty led rings and then have to seal the light housing up and put the bumper back on. I am going to wait a little longer to see if any more burn out. Also, the strobe function is the same as flash. Flash should stay on the same color and flash..

The Royal Purple HMX is an excellent oil, reduces consumption on really old vehicles, and is very persistent about holding viscosity even in very hot summer weather.  HOWEVER, the current version, for several years, is API SN rated, *as is stated in the product description*.  What I received was API SL rated (several years older stock, less rigorous standard).  Disappointing to say the least, especially considering the price.

Who would even think that a major improvement could be made to something as simple as a boat fender.  I like the Extreme Max BoatTector better than the standard boat fender because it takes up less room when it's inside the boat and it protects the top of the gunnel from damage from the dock.

This is a waterproof trash can for your car, supposedly. But with a little imagination, I found it to be much more!First off, when I got it, I thought it was too nice for trash. I put it in my backseat and I realized I don't have that much trash on the road. So I had the idea of putting my kid's stuff in it.  Put it next to his seat and all his action figures fit nicely inside, and even gave him a place for his water bottle.But then, I realized, he's only in the car a short time in the day,whereas I'm in the car all the time. So I dumped his stuff out and moved it to the front seat. I put my outgoing mail and packages in it. As you can see from the photos, that worked perfectly. Even giving the inevitable Netflix envelope an easy view so I don't forget to mail it. And it has handles to carry it with. As well as a flap to cover it all.This was great.  But it could go further. I found that ordinary file folders fit perfectly inside, along with my laptop (in it's case).  The pockets give me a place for mail, water bottles,etc.  I suppose if I used it for business I could black out the logo "Trash-Zilla" with a sharpie, but I don't mind it.As you can see, I really like it.  It's like the items sold very expensively by that company "Thirty-One" at home parties.  This could hold knitting materials on a trip, books to return to the library...it's almost like a diaper bag for adults to carry all their oddball stuff. And the waterproofing works in a reverse way: nothing in the car can spill on the insides.  For now, I have all my work stuff for Monday in it and ready to go. On Fridays I will bring it in the house to restock.Very inventive and nice as well as made sturdy and strong.  Big like!I rec'd a sample at no charge from the manufacturer to sample and review and give input on.

Hi, Just had the same problem this weekend on a 04' F150. Replaced cracked corroded FPDM with the Dorman 590-001.  That "white spacer" a few have mentioned, is part of the Ford female connector on the truck. It detaches from the end of the connector  and sticks in the bottom of the FPDM where the 6 male pins are. It's meant to align the pins and hold them tight in the connection housing and maybe help keep out dust dirt and moisture. *Make sure to pull it out of the old FPDM if it's stuck in there and reattach it to the connector end before plugging into the new FPDM. Starts quicker and intermittent idle issue now gone.

50 Straight-I am rating this lightbar 4 stars due to the fact that the shipping was completely awful and the box was all scuffed up on the corners when I received it.Turns out the lightbar did not fit where I intended it to go so I gave it to my buddy to mount on the top of his truck. Bright light but to me it looks like its been used and the shipping was the worst Ive ever had. I ended up purchasing a Rigidhorse lightbar and it was perfect.

No comparison to the old incandescent headlights on my 02 Vinson500. Lower two are floods and the handlebar light is a spot beam. I simply cut the old wires at the back of the factory headlight housings and connected them to the factory wiring. Take your time, manage the wiring properly and use the right connectors and you will be set for a long time.

Item arrived one day early. Seems to be made of very high quality material. Fit my class IV 2" perfectly. I did notice the bar was kind of big and slide around. For $1.28, I bought some garden hose washers from Home Depot and put them on both sides of the lock. Fits perfectly now.

So far, "Car Guys Best Wheel and Tire Cleaner" have been working out great for me. I have yet to compare it to washing/scrubbing a wheel without this cleaner, but it is definitely plasti-dip safe. I tried this cleaner on my black plast-dipped rims caked with brake dust and now i have my black wheels back!This product is recommended for those with or without plastidipped wheels and even though it does require some elbow grease to get those caked on brake dust off, it will make your wheels look clean once again! Just follow the directions listed on the bottle and scrub away!Like the bottle says, a little goes a long way. I will be uploading new photos as my former post was unable to make it up here.

It looks just like the one I took out of my 06 F-150  It is in the top rear of the pass side valve cover, I didn't know how to remove the large plastic hose from it so I took the hose off the intake by pushing out on a small green lever on the hose conection, I turned the PCV valve 1/4 turn counter clock wise and was able to pull the valve, hose and wire out far enough to unplug the wires, I also found out the hose comes off the same way as it comes off the intake.( small green lever )

I purchased these bulbs to replace my stock high beam halogens in my 2016 Accord.  I've purchased other Safego LED's in the past and have been happy with their products.  These were no different.  Very nice and high quality bulbs.  Very easy to install, just remove the old stock bulbs and put these in.  Did a quick test and found they are super bright and outperform the stock bulbs by a long shot.  They are right around a 6000k color which matches all my other LED bulbs on the front of the car.

Worked perfectly. I was hesitant to buy after reading some of the low star reviews but I chanced it and I'm glad I did. No more holding the gate with my head on cold days. They are smaller in diameter than my stock pistons but work just fine, even on a 35* night. Super easy install, took 15 min even with digging for tools. Remove and retain the 4 C clips holding the wrist pins in place, prop the gate with a stick and remove the pins, working one side then the other. Be sure to reinstall the upper pins first, it's easier to lift the gate up to get the lower pins to align then the uppers. I did have to take channel locks and compress (bend) the bracket on the lower piston side mount as the steel bracket is made from thicker material than stock. No big deal. I added pics, the stock piston is on the right with the larger chrome piston rod.

Definitely recommend! This is just a piece that goes on the DA tool, so my review of that pretty much covered my review of this, but the compound pack definitely provides the most obvious results of this group of tools/attachments from Meguiars. I put it to use today on my dad's 24 year old F-150 as a Father's Day gift/gesture, and had amazing results from a paint job I wasn't expecting to turn out so nice! I am by no means a professional detailer, so getting these results blew my mind! Being cordless is a bonus - just make sure you have a couple of charged batteries on hand so you can finish the job without having to wait on batteries to charge. Took his old truck from dingy to shiny! Obviously on a vehicle this age, it can't make it perfect, but it did make enough of a difference to draw some looks.

Great seller, with FAST shipping! I ordered them midday on a Weds and they were delivered by Friday mid morning even though the shipping info from Amazon say midway through the following week, so that was awesome!The shocks seem to be of good quality, and I bought them after doing tons of research and their reputation.  With that said, one point that I thought was interesting, is that upon taking off my STOCK shocks, and going to put on these aftermarket ones that are supposed to be designed for leveled trucks (ie sit taller) I was surprised to see that the shocks were the same length as my stock ones!  Anyways, after install (which went smooth on my 06 Chevy 2500HD, and only took about 1.5hrs for front & rears with air tools) the ride has definitely improved, especially in rougher terrain. Its still a 3/4 ton truck, and rides as such, but this was a great upgrade.

I started bicycling last Fall and went a few trips without a bike rack.  While I have a mid-size SUV, it was a pain to lug around my bicycle in this manner.  I ended up purchasing a Curt hitch because they are so solidly rated.  I then started looking for bike racks when I realized Curt also made a hitch with the specs I was looking for for a lot less cost than its competitors (my friend had a top of the line used one just like this and wanted $120 more than this one new - eh... no).  I compared it with a few others and I kept coming back to it because the reviews were so solidly rated like the hitch.  I'm so glad I stuck to my intuition and got it.  I love that this holds two bikes (I set them opposite directions of each other for an easier fit).  The adjustable arms are of a hardy, thick foam and lock down on the bikes well.  I also appreciate the large twist grips to tighten the arms because I have rheumatoid arthritis and they're easier on my hands to turn.  There are a number of ways you can store this while it's still attached to your car (I set mine like the fourth photo so it sits vertical with my trunk).  It is a little heavy but even with my RA, I can still easily hold the rack and adjust the threaded shanks when I need to change the rack's position.  I like the quality of the material as well; It's been in the rain a few times and there are no rust spots.  Like others have mentioned, I do secure my bike(s) with a 4' bike lock in the event that the bike(s) get shifted around while driving they won't fall off.  I have not purchased a lock to secure this to the hitch yet (my hitch has a 2" opening while this one is 1 1/4") as I don't leave it on the car full time just yet.  I'm sure when the weather gets nicer and I ride a few times a week I will do that but it's not a hard fix.  Yeah it doesn't come standard but for the price point and the quality of what you're getting, spending a few more bucks for a lock isn't a deal breaker for me.  Definitely consider this bike rack if you're in the market for this style.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  **UPDATE** For those noticing a wobble, ours also does this from time to time but if you tighten the rack with a tool to the hitch the wobbling will go away.  Using your hands doesn't always get it tight enough to get the job done.  Hope this helps.

These are a perfect fit for my 2006 Nissan Frontier NISMO.  My truck has one retention device on the driver side, and this product description was kind enough to list that small but crucial detail.  Several of the mat sets are outfitted for 2 retention devices.  The previous set I bought (Aries 3D) were one of these sets and I had to remove my single retention device to get the mats to lay right.  Even then, they didn't fit perfectly.  As soon as I put these Weather Tech mats into the truck, my OCD breathed a deep sigh of release.  Perfect fit and a reasonable price, they look like they were factory made for the vehicle.

This fits perfectly and appears to be well made.  I fit this in my 2016 Subaru BRZ.  I'm attaching a few pics to show the proper way to install this because it can be confusing with the arrows printed on the filter.  The arrow on the original filter is not the airflow but and orientation mark (this side up) however, the airflow goes from top to bottom.  There is an arrow on the FRAM filter that shows airflow so the arrow on the replacement filter should point down when installed properly in a Subaru.  If it's installed perpendicular, the arrow will be pointing to the center of the car.

The tray fits perfectly, like if it came with the car. It matches even the color of the oem armrest storage. The insert feels sturdy made with quliaty materials. The plastic is thick and shiny and the rubber mats are thick and flexible. I have been looking for something like this for the armrest storage since without it it is basically a square hole that is 15 inches deep. I am not surprised by the quality of the make as I came to expect that from Kust.

I installed the CURT Harness on my 2017 Santa Fe a little while back, the instructions are very complete and it's a very simple job, done in about 20 minutes.I was told a few weeks later that my lights weren't working right and after inspecting it myself found that the left rear blinker stayed on all the time (and didn't otherwise function).  I placed a call to Curt's customer service line and they gave me a test to do with my voltmeter and asked to call them back.  I did this and the results didn't make sense to them so they kindly sent me out a replacement unit (free of charge) and asked that I send the old one back to diagnose it.Upon installing the replacement I immediately found what was wrong.  The Santa Fe has a "faux/stylized tailpipe" in the bumper (the actual exhaust pipe is a smaller diameter pipe suspended in the middle of this meant to not really be seen).  I had routed the wiring over that faux opening thinking that it didn't actually touch the exhaust and wouldn't get that hot.  THIS.IS.WRONG.Curt has made a product that is very easy to install and works perfectly when you follow the directions, they are even very helpful when their end users do dumb things.  Don't do dumb things.  This wasn't the first Curt product I've bought and certainly won't be my last.

This was an essential item to take with me on the Transfagarasan road in Romania.  There are so many places to stop and get impromptu scenic shots, but with narrow and unimproved shoulders.However, what you see here is not a finish product, IMO.  There needs to be an easy way to deploy and retrieve the item.  I simply tied a string to it long enough to reach the left handlebar.  In order to orderly store the puck with the string, I cut two notches in it so the string can be wrapped around it.  I think for an extra dollar the manufacturer could do what I did and sell a completed product.

This organizer does what it's supposed to do. I am not what you'd call a neat and organized person. At least not where the trunk of my car is concerned. I keep a ton of emergency gear in my trunk at all times because I drive late at night a lot on highways in the middle of nowhere. Stuff like a rain coat, blanket, repair tools, gloves, flares, etc (Break down one time in the middle of the night on a desolate highway with no cell signal and you'll keep a ton of stuff in the car too)Until today all that gear was just tossed in my trunk. You can see the mess in the before and after pictures below. That left me little room for other stuff when needed. And it made it a severe pain in the rump to get to my spare tire.This carrier really helps clean that up. It's obviously not magic or advanced science. It's a box. You put stuff in it. Said stuff then becomes organized. Where this thing becomes cooler than a normal box is the handles that make it easy to pull all the stuff out of the trunk to make room for other stuff / give access to the spare tire / etc.It's well made. It's a thick sturdy canvas. The handles are well secured to it. I have at least 50 pounds of stuff in it and it doesn't seem strained at all when I lift it.The mesh pockets on the sides give extra organizing space for little items. The zippered pockets on the ends do the same.The thing does fold up into a small briefcase just like the description above says it does. I can't argue with how well it does that. But I can't figure out a reason why I'd want to do that.The cooler bag that's included is insulated, but it's not a cooler that will keep something frozen in a hot car all day or anything like that. The insulation on it is more like you'd see on a nice lunch bag, not camping grade Coleman cooler. It'll work to keep stuff cool for a couple hours, not a full day.Again, the photos below are before and after I cleaned up the trunk with this organizer. Everything that was in the trunk before is in the trunk now.I was sent a sample of this product for the purpose of reviewing it.

Looks pretty cool on my car. I needed a sunshade especially for the summer, having a black car with a black interior, and the CA drought isn't really helping the weather either. Anyway, I thought this would be fun to put in my car. Quality wise, I would say it's pretty durable. When you first open it, it feels really tough. It has the sort of bubble-wrap feeling to it. I like the suction cups that keep it attached to the winshield so you don't have to anchor it down with your own shades. But after about two months, one suction cup doesn't stay on all the time (not really a big deal for me). Putting it up and taking it down a bunch of times definitely takes a toll on the material, so there's some bends here and there, and it's part of the reason why the suction might not stay up that long. When it gets hot, the material gets a lot more flimsy, but when it's cold, the material is super hard. Usually it's difficult to wrap the velcro strap back on to put it away, but there is a velcro strap and buttons to fold it back up nicely. I don't expect this thing to last for a very long time, and overall I think it's good for the price

I had already installed a Tridon EL 12 on my Honda Rebel in anticipation of going LED, but the options just weren't there in the DOT certified categories.  I had to widen the holes that normally allow the turn signal wires to escape the rear electrical harness, but these did fit right in.They are very flexible compared to OEM stuff, but I'm thinking they won't have a problem there behind the plate.

If these mats we're correct I'm thinking they would be alright. They are very light weight. Ok on the driver's side but leaves me wondering about the passenger side. The entire back of the mat that is Prickly so it should stick to the carpeting reasonably well. I'm going to try and reorder these mats but if they send me another set for a Festiva I'm not going to be too thrilled. it seems to be very difficult to actually talk to someone to make sure I get the right match next time.

I have a 3/4-ton Crew-Cab truck (dark gray), it's a lot of surface area to wash & wax. I've always used traditional carnauba waxes and as everyone knows they are a lot of elbow grease especially if the wax hardens too much, double especially for large vehicles! So I did some research online and everyone seems to love this synthetic liquid wax, especially for dark vehicles. This also doesn't stain black plastic trim white. I bought this package locally and figured I would give my truck a wash & wax before the weather turned cold.WOW, I was shocked how easy it was going on & off. Seriously, even for my large truck the included microfiber towel was all I needed to wipe the wax off. Trick is to apply it THIN (as you will read on many many reviews). It will barely haze, and there is no rush wiping it off. All it took was a light wipe to make the haze disappear and shine up nice. I am a convert!I'm going to look into some of their other products to use in-between waxes, but seriously as quick as this was I might just wax on a monthly basis now. I checked the container before & after and was shocked how little product I ended up using! This should last me at least a dozen more waxes on my truck!EDIT - Never fails to rain the next day, LOL. Hood beaded up very nice, water was gliding off as I was driving down the road. Can't wait to see how it holds up over time.

It seemed to be missing the blue wiring harness that the passenger side came with but I contacted the seller and they shipped me the correct part. Installed it on my 2011 4Runner Trail Edition. Installation couldn't have been simpler. Truly plug and play!Edit: about a year later they're still holding up really well. Very happy with this purchase!!

Replaced my 2013 WRX cabin air filter with this and I immediately noticed a difference in airflow and freshness of the air coming from the vent. Old filters are nasty! Replace yours soon!

Like another reviewer, I got this at a local big-box store (in my case on clearance for a whole lot less).  The "short version" I don't think it's worth the full $50-$60 but I do think it has good value on sale.I haven't had the opportunity to test it starting a car but I have done a number of other tests and I have mixed feelings on the ratings although it seems well designed and safe from what I see.Battery capacity is NOT 8000mAh.  After fully-charging the battery, I used a low-power load (2A) to discharge it thru a current-analyzer meter while logging the voltage on a computer.  The readings when it dropped below 9V were 26.8Wh and 2.474Ah over a 1h15m time period.  I believe the 8AH rating is a "marketing gimmick" - to obtain the required voltage this would have about 3 cells in series to get the ~12V output.  If you divide 8 by 3 that's 2.6aH which is very close to my reading.  In reality putting cells in series does NOT increase the capacity, only the voltage.  This doesn't sound like a product-flaw but a marketing-flaw.  Assuming the "fuzzy marketing math" is to blame, that's actually very good to see the cells performing within about 7% error from the theoretical maximum.Some more good news, the USB outputs do provide at least their rated output.  There's one for 2A charging tablets and other high current things another 1A for phones.  When tested separately they provided 2.3A and 1.4A respectively without significant voltage drop.  I don't have the means to test both at the same time but it claims that you can draw a combined 3A.  This beats a few other phone-charger  packs I've tried although the capacity is a bit lower.The cables seem a bit thin for the advertised current but they are probably sufficient for a second of surge-power.  They are 10AWG wire and it looks like about 10AWG inside the case to the actual battery.  This is good, better than some of the competition (which I've seen with thinner wires) - but it's not going to give you the same power as some good old 4AWG booster cables at least not for the same amount of time.One thing I was very impressed by was the safety features.  The "brains" of the safety features are in the box on the jumper-leads, if you use one of the various "power socket" adapters it doesn't get the same low-voltage cutoff and other things as the battery is wired directly to the jack on the main unit.  When used with the included "battery clamps" though it has a variety of good protections including back-feed protection.  This means if you do start your car it shuts off to avoid high current INTO the Lithium battery (which can be dangerous).  I was impressed to see that.  They also have a low-voltage cutoff around 10V to protect the Lithium battery from over-discharge while jump-starting (which can be equally dangerous).The connector it uses for the "booster cables" is a standard EC5 with male (pins) connector in the jump-pack and female (receptacle) on the battery-clamps.  You can get "lighter socket" adapters to have a light-weight portable power supply for automotive gadgets (including power inverters) but do be careful to watch the battery level because it does not have protection against over-discharge when you do that.  This is what I used for my battery-discharge tests so I didn't have to have it clamped onto a car battery to "turn on".To use the "jump start" feature you connect the battery clamps to your weak battery, then plug them into the booster-unit.  After that, hold in the little button on the side for a second or so the green light should come on.  Then it's putting out power and you're ready to go.  Fairly simple and straightforward.  If it detects a fault, it'll instead flash some series of green or red lights indicating what type of fault (reverse-protection, short-circuit, reverse-charge, low-voltage, high-temperature) so you can tell what's wrong.I don't think I'd depend on this as my only option but I think it would be good for the majority of times when you need "a tiny bit more" to get going with a weak-but-not-dead battery.  I'd still keep some extra-heavy (4AWG or better) traditional cables just in case you find yourself with a really dead battery.UPDATE:I've increased my rating by an additional star after having more time to perform additional tests, this time on the 5V 2A USB output specifically (even my phone will charge at >1A so I am only interested in the 2A output).  It seems that there's something going on with the voltage converter that results in the output at 5V appearing to be more than 2.5Ah that I measured previously testing only the 12V output.  In connecting a 2.0A constant test load to the USB port it ran for 2 hours 35 minutes and measured a significantly higher apparent capacity of 5100mAh (25.5Wh) from a fully-charged to fully-drained battery.  This is significantly better than I expected so this unit would be much more useful than I expected for charging your phone/tablet, probably 1 full charge "and a bit more" based on my smartphone's battery capacity.  I'm not including a discharge-curve for this test because it isn't relevant; the USB output held at no less than 4.99V right up to the very end and the 12V output looks the same as the original discharge curve just stretched over longer time and cutting off the USB power when the internal battery hits 9.5V.So why the difference?  In all likelyhood it's related to the rate of discharge - while the load in both cases is 2A when this is consumed from the 12V output it's drawing 24 watts of power, on the USB output which is 5V the same 2A only consumes 10 watts of power - less than half the amount of power!.  Typically batteries provide a smaller apparent portion of their full capacity as usable power when drained at higher rates - and since we don't know what the discharge rate spec is for these batteries it's possible they can perform sub-standard in one use but meet the rated capacity in another use.  Whether that provides the amount of power you want the way you want it is another story entirely (as shown in my original test).I'm still not super excited at the lower-than-expected numbers measuring from the 12V output but these new findings suggest it will be much more versatile than I originally anticipated for a USB battery pack.  This absolutely increases it's value in every-day use, just don't run it dead playing on your gadgets and find yourself stranded needing a jump-start with a dead booster pack.UPDATE #2:So I have had the opportunity to try and use this for it's advertised purpose...and I must say I'm very disappointed.  I left a 2-way radio on in my car while I was off for Christmas and it ran my battery down enough that all my accessories, remote-fob, lights, fan, etc. worked but I couldn't start my engine.First attempt to start my car I checked and the LCD reported 100% (been sitting a month but not used since charged) so I took it out and hooked up per the instructions.  Except it wouldn't go green, the light just blinked a 4-red-flash code meaning the booster pack had too low voltage to attempt to use it.Second attempt with a different one of the same model boost pack only sitting for a couple days, it also said 100% on the LCD and actually lit up green when I tried to jump with it.  So I went around and turned the key - got about 2 seconds of slow cranking then 1-2 more seconds of very slow cranking and all my dash lights went out and relays were clicking angrily.  When I checked the boost pack it now was flashing low voltage shutoff.At that point I was pissed so I went and got some real traditional jumper cables and my roomate's car and mine fired up in under a second very easily.At this point I don't think I can recommend this pack for anything.  There are better options for USB power (such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/USB-C-Power-Bank-RAVPower-26800-PD-Portable-Charger-26800mAh-Faster-Recharged-in-4-5-Hours-USB-C-Input-30W-Type-C-Output-for-Nintendo-Switch-USB-Type-C-Laptops-2016-MacBook-Power-Delivery-Support/dp/B01LRQDAEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">USB C Power Bank RAVPower 26800 PD Portable Charger 26800mAh(Faster Recharged in 4.5 Hours &USB-C Input, 30W Type-C Output)for Nintendo Switch, USB Type-C Laptops, 2016 MacBook Power Delivery Support</a>&nbsp;which even supports USB-C PD for modern gadgets and has 4x the power capacity of this little jump start pack for charging stuff.  As for cars, a set of good heavy (6AWG or 4AWG, heavier the better) cables would be cheaper and more reliable than this boost pack thing.

First impression of the tool is awesome, looks very sturdy and a step up in quality from everything else. Its also fun to play with, like a Lego.It was delivered correctly as advertised, no parts missing and all brand new in a sealed case.First time doing this so not a pro, but im used to do all sort of mechanical work. I also read all instructions before use and watched some videos online before doing anything.I own a Kawasaki ZX10R and a Kawasaki KLX250SF, used this for the 1st.Since its a 525 chain, I grinded off the rivet heads as the very short and to the point manual says.Assembled the tool as it says and managed to break the chain without problems. However when I was dissasembling the tool the tip of the pointer was deformed which means I can no longer remove it from the guider (see pictures).Then to press the plates of the link. The tool worked perfectly and I was able to set it in place with much ease.Last, to seal the link. The tool worked fine. Its very easy to put it in place and point it correctly however you need to have some major hand strenght to get the job done. The tool doesnt help here and the included wrench is so thin it will make your hand hurt.To sum up, its good enough but don't buy it if you service motorcycles for a living. I would buy it again if I had to, I just wish the steel quality of the pointers was higher.

It doesn't fit my BMW 640i Coup perfectly because as you can see in the photo, it can't go in between the seat and center console due to carpeting. I had to raise it above that and mount it that way, only time will tell if it holds up. The quality of it is good especially concerning the price I paid and the tape they supply is 3M auto tape which is good. Dont understand negatives, as long as you clean both surfaces good, the tape will hold unless it melts due to heat inside the car.

I installed these in my 1999 Toyota Tacoma to cover worn/ripped cloth seats and am totally impressed by the fit and look. I have another Coverking set made of Spacermesh in my Subaru and they've held up well. I expect a long life for these NeoSupreme covers.Each seat cover is two pieces; a top and a bottom. Also included were matching headrest covers. They sent 3 different sets of headrest covers, two of the sets fit my headrests though the sets were slightly different. The third was totally different. I do not know it this was intentional due to variation in seat design or just a lucky mistake by the shipper. Also in the box was a long plastic tool to aid in installation and a one page installation guide.Installation wasn't bad at all, the seat backs take only a few minutes each. The seat bottoms took a little longer due to an amplifier that takes up the space under the driver's seat. The passenger side was easy. In total it was less than an hour. The other set I have were similarly easy to install. Instructions say to tighten straps after a few weeks. I expect doing that and a little time will smooth out the slightly wavy fit of the seat bottomsNote-->In the pics below you will see a covered armrest between the seats, this DID NOT come as part of the purchase.  I used some fabric from the unnecessary headrest covers and glued it to the existing armrest. I was pleasantly surprised by the result.

Garbage. Came with two thick molding inclusions blocking the opening (see picture). I am going on a five hour drive tomorrow and wanted to upgrade my old stock head unit on my 98 Jeep ZJ to have decent sound. Not gonna happen now. because this is going to look like garbage at the spots that had to be sawed.Nothing anywhere mentions to expect this so it's either dishonest advertising or whoever packed it was lazy or told to pack it anyway by supervisor.

Great product. I didn't receive the mounting brackets like advertised, but instead received the perfect ones for my 2018 Ford F150. Turns out I didn't have to trim the bed liner like most videos suggest, but it was too late when I figured it out. The Swing Case covers the area where trimmed I have to slam it a little harder than I would like to get it to latch.

Not what I had hoped to get. Clip specs absent, you had to guess. Rating is based on how poor the photo descriptions were to help one decide fit. I needed these to fit the front valance of a 4Runner and as one can see these clips are too long. Wasted money. Look at the pics, the bolt is 1-1/8" long and 1/4" wide UHL black(whatever that means)

This plate is mounted on my 2008 Toyota Rav4. I love this plate. Great design. I gave this a 2 star because, the metal is thin. All vibrations when driving is transferred to the fog lights causing flickering. I had to re enforce the plate with brackets and plates to stop it from vibrating. Yes, I recommend this plate, but you may encounter the vibration problem.

EDIT ..... They look badass on the truck to bad they won't last :/ .... Overall the lights look pretty cool however they are not sealed properly the weather striping rubber around the lights are all out of place .... Lights look nice worth the 20 bucks but if I where to buy them again I would spend a little more and get better quality " look closely at the pictures and you will notice around the light how the sealing rubber is squeezed out... Out of place

Update 8/24/16:My clamp melted at the electrical box section. I detached it and set it next to my other clamp and when I turned around they were on fire. Turns out the melted one was still burning internally then the plastic caught fire. Luckily I was there to put it out. I contacted the company via email and sent them pics and my receipt. Well folks forget about customer service!!!! I ended up spending $15 on some decent leads (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WAX4MZE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Even though the battery itself was great the leads being crap and the customer service worse I think I'll look elsewhere next time.Original review:First off I want to clarify I bought this for $79 from New Egg. I was skeptical on what it would do but figured 16.5 amps on a 3 cell Lithium battery might do the trick. I have an old 95 Power Stroke 7.3 diesel Ford Truck that the traditional power boxes consistently fail to start after there 6 months old. So I picked up the G06 to try out. I drained my 2 batteries in the truck by leaving the lights and blower motor on till the starter would only give a slight 1/4 turn of the motor then stop. The headlight where dim and my battery tester said 11 volts. To my surprise the G06 started it right up, repeatedly at least 3 times before I was satisfied. One caveat though is you diesel better be in good shape with good glow plugs or a can of starter fluid as this will not sustain a long start sequence without hurting itself! Now to the reason for 3 stars!!! The advertising is miss leading as I couldn't resist and opened up the unit. I fly Quad Copters, RC Helicopters etc and am familiar with LiPoly battery's. When I popped this open I inspected the battery. It's a 3 cell (3x3.7V) that when charged to 100% will give you 12V + voltage. But at 5 1/2"x2"x1" it is physically impossible to get the 16.5 amps out of this. For example on an RC sight a 3 cell LiPo 5800mah (5.8 amp) pack is 6.2"x1.7"x1.2". I was going and may still test this but my charge/discharge tester goes to 5000 mah. I have pics of the pak and video of the truck starts if I can figure how to link it up. Overall I am extremely happy with the unit, time will tell BUT am not happy with the Chinese sellers (most) that almost always highly overate capacity. On one pic you can see the size compared to a DJI Phantom 2 battery that's 5200mAh's. DJI is at the forefront of battery technology as it keeps a Quad copter that runs $700 to $2000 plus in the air. Does Bolt Power know something that DJI doesn't? Unlikely!

Perfect replacement for early R53 egg yokes, easy install, just reuse the nut from the old light housings. Don't forget to buy some amber or red turn bulbs to replace the white ones from the OEM light set, as in most states it's illegal to have white rear turn signals.  Otherwise plug and play for the lighting fixture. Great bling addition for a modern classic.

Product received as ordered.  Looks like a well made light.  I mounted it to my ROLA roof rack with some Brackets from Modify Street.I didn't give it 5 stars because the front glass seems to be a bit foggy on the inside, like someone had cleaned it and assembled it before it was completely dry, or left a haze.  I'm not certain if this will clear up or if it even causes an issue with the usability. But it made it not look brand new out of the box.  We shall see.  So far, so good with everything else.

I have bought LED and HID lights before this and I get that bulbs and styles of lights are going to be different. I do however expect the lights to be as good if not better than the stock lights. As you can see in my pictures they don't even come close. These turned my lights into accent lighting. If that's what you are going for then by all means these lights are perfect. The seller Was helpful but said these worked as described.

I own a sparking graphite BMW which has a tendency to show swirls more.  As a result I insist that I'm the only one to wash my car simply because I don't trust anyone else too.I bought a bottle of Driven from the Sacramento State Fair about 5 years ago and found myself immediately impressed with how good it was.  It either hides or buffs out minor swirls and leaves your car feeling silky smooth.  However the best trait of the polish is that you can apply it on a dark car in the blazing sun and it still wipes off with zero effort.  I recently ran out of this polish so I went to the local auto shop and bought Meguiar's Ultimate Polish to polish up the car prior to waxing it.  Almost immediately I regretted buying the product as I struggled to get the polish buffed out no matter how small I kept the area I was working on.  Admittedly I wasn't doing it in a shaded garage but it was also not that hot of a day.  Likely I've just been spoiled by years of using Driven Automotive Polish.  After about 1 hr of struggling with the Meguiars I took out my "empty" bottle of Driven and shook out what I could and was able to finish the entire car in less than 20 minutes (also used it to remove the pasty marks left by the Meguiars).  I was going to wax the car after using Driven but changed my mind as I was pretty tired from struggling with the Meguiars.  The cool thing is that I'm not certain you need to wax after using Driven (if the manufacturers could comment, that would be great).  I never have and it's always been fine...maybe wax would be overkill.After that I went back to my apartment and ordered up a new bottle of Driven.  This will likely be the product I use for the rest of my life on my vehicles.  It's easy to use, smooth, and leaves a nice finish, and protects the paint.  If you do it once you likely will only have to take your car to the spray car wash, rinse it off with high powered water, and dry it off with an Absorber.  Then in a few months, use the Driven polish again and your car will look as good as new.Honestly I think this is the best product out there.  I've tried just about every polish/wax and this is the best hands down.  I'm surprised that they don't carry this at O'Reilly's or Autozone.  If they did, the Driven folks would make millions.  Nothing compares...buy it, your car will love you for it.

The plastics on the original radiator in my 97 Legacy L were starting to deteriorate and leak, so I replaced it with this one.  It was a perfect fit, as advertised.  Included new bolt clips for the fans, but nothing else.  A couple of the fins were bent when the radiator arrived, but not a big deal.  Spectra offers a 24 month warranty according to their website.During a pressure test, the hand tightened drain plug was leaking, so I had to tighten it up with some pliers about a quarter turn.Some install tips:Install the ATF cooler hoses with the radiator out of the car.  Much easier to get the hoses on all the way.UPDATE 6/18/16: No problems so far, works great!UPDATE 8/26/17.  Still works great.  In fact, I've been towing up to 1200 lbs with this car, and I've had no issues.in the 76K this radiator has been in the car

The print quality isn't great. There are spots where the yellow background comes through the black letters.  See attached photos.This doesn't matter much to me at all because I'm buying it as a gag gift for my girlfriend, but if I wanted it for my 16 year old kid I'd like it to have a nicer print quality. However, for the price it's really not all that bad.

My review is from the perspective of a 63 year old male, in super shape, but never the less, 63 years old. Today, was the first time ever putting on a RV cover and I found it super super simple - about 20-25 minutes from start to finish. It's lightweight (30 lbs or so) and as long as you take your time, pay attention, and move cautiously (as you are up 12 or so feet), it is easy to do. Start with the front and lay the sides over the edges and work you way to the rear. After you climb down the ladder, you simply go around the coach and pull it down all the way from the ground level. While my coach is 37', it's fit so good, especially due to the two front and rear straps, as well as the five, well placed, under the carriage straps. You also have zipper access to the entry door, as well as the front windshield area and coach rear. You can access all of your exterior compartments and when done, walk the coach and secure the straps. Again, super simple and easy. I'm super pleased thus far. Time will tell how well it stands up to the Florida weather.

This sturdy trunk organizer packs a lot of thoughtful features. Way better than the plastic tub I've been using in my Grand Caravan. See my photos; I've illustrated as many aspects as I can.PROS:Buckles in collapsed position when not in use.Mesh exterior pockets along both sides (roughly 5x7").More mesh pockets on one side of the central divider.Hook and loop flapped pocket on one end.Dual zipper pockets on the other end, with hazard reflector on the inside wall.Separate aluminized soft cooler with handle.Internal dividers can function as floor stiffeners, for vertical segmentation or horizontally to provide a "hidden" lower partition.Hook and loop patches on bottom to secure on carpeted floors (covers provided in case you don't use this feature).Comes in a drawcord bag that can be used to hold junk.CONS:No shoulder strap (probably not a big loss).Handles are rather skimpy, so might not be comfortable carrying a fully loaded organizer.Being open topped, it won't be convenient to stack stuff on top.I gave it five stars, so you know that I was impressed with this product. But I'll probably stow more stuff now that I have room. Current cargo includes: vinyl poncho, space blanket, towel, camping towel, first aid kit, fire extinguisher, interior wipes, heavy-duty (and long) jumper cables, tow strap, safari cap, driver set, wrench set. ice scraper

The belt is decent quality and is the right length for "with AC" although every 3.3L might have AC, not sure.  The idler pulley had some wobble to it after 20 miles which can't be taken out by re-tightening.  It might not be a big deal, but the OEM original had no play at all (wondering if I should put the old one back on).  On the positive side, the price is definitely right for this kit.  Seperately, the belt and the tensioner go for ~ $80. Installed on 2006 Chrysler T&C minivan easily.  Still working after 100 miles.

This is invaluable for automotive restoration.  Rather than bead blasting small parts and hardware you can soak them in Evapo-Rust for 1-2 days (if really crusty) and they usually come out looking like bare metal.  You need to scrub with a brush and/or scotchbrite pad in water with a mild detergent, dry and oil after soaking in order to remove the residue from the rust and the solution.  You can final finish with a fine wire wheel, more scotchbrite etc.  Then leave bare, use a protectant, paint, plate, whatever is needed.  Larger parts can be done in cheap plastic storage tubs (under bed style) from wallyworld or other chain stores.  Really crusty rust will come off but the surface will be pitted and usually a bit dark.  This stuff removes gold cad plating and anodizing pretty quickly.  Doesn't seem to remove silver cad/zinc.

Initially I had some trouble installing this LED light bulbs in my Chevy Tahoe 2002.(The instructions here for installation should cover Chevy Tahoe 1999-2002, as I have understood those years share the same headlights)Please see all pictures, it may answer some of your questions for the installation.ISSUES:1) I had no clearance between the headlight projector housing and the black bridge bracket that mounts to the car.2) The first time I connected the light bulbs, they did not work.SOLUTIONS:1) I removed the black bridge bracket from the projector housing, and I was able to easily install the light bulbs, once installed there is plenty of space for the bridge without the light bulb being press or twisted in any form.2) For the light bulb to work I realized that I had to reverse the polarity of the plug, for it to work. The only problem with this is that the locking tab no longer works, so I had to wrap both ends with electrical tape to make sure the plug does not come loose with the road vibrations and bumps. For this SUV you will have to remove the black bridge for the lenses housing in order to install the low beam LED bulbs, there is no other way around. Check the pictures to see the screws that you need to remove, do not turn around the adjustments screws there is no need for that, and you may change the existing alignment that you have for the headlights.There is space to install the high beam LED bulbs, it will require to remove the black bridge and do a minor modification.The cooling fans for the light bulbs work great and it is a must to have. Once I turn off the light and the fan stops I felt some residual heat emanating from the aluminum heat sink /dissipaters.I can hear the fan if I am in front of the headlights (with the engine off), but they are not loud.In the pictures you will see that the left headlight is different than the right, that is because I have two sets, since I needed to remove the black bridge in order to install the light bulbs, I decided to try it first in the older headlights before I decided to do it in the newer ones.The only thing that I noticed is that this LED light bulbs do not lock as tight as Sylvania halogens, I will update this review as time pass to let you know about durability, of the LED bulbs, the fans, and if there are any issues with water entering the headlight assembly.I like the very white light that now I have with this LED light. I drive at night in dark asphalt roads, this is a welcome improvement.I hope that you like the review if you have any questions, let me know, I will do my best to answer you.I received these LED headlight bulbs, with a promo code form the vendor for me to install, test and review them, while I give my honest and unbiased opinion.

The opening from the original fill wasn't big enough. This one is a little bigger. I had to use an oscillating tool to widen the opening. As you can see from my picture, my camper is a little older. Not sure if it will bolt right up to a newer camper/RV better.Even with having to modify the hole a bit, it wasn't a bad replacement job. Added som butyl and some caulk to seal it up. Looks much better than my dry rotted, brittle original one.

These wheel locks are very strong to fit my 2015 Toyota Tacoma with Chrome Wheels.I really love this design that looks very nice with the chrome circle mirror at the centerand easily to be installed or removed.  The price is very reasonable !!!I would recommend this product to all my friends.

I really wanted this to be as good as the ratings indicated, but the two I received both had kinks upon arrival, despite the anti-kink claim.  The first was kinked just below the strain relief coil.  It wouldn't have completely blocked the flow, but would have reduced it somewhat.  And it's a weakness that would only get worse with each use.  I sent it back but the replacement hose had a kink further toward the center of the hose - see attached photo.  I suspect they're winding into too tight a coil for shipping.  I really wanted this to work - I like the machined fittings and strain relief coils, which are hard to find.  But I don't have enough time left to risk a third try, so I'm switching to a different brand.

Got this Smittybilt Gen2 XRC Front bumper in Oct 2015.  Really solid bumper -- looks great on my 2013 Jeep.  I have mounted some JW Speaker Fog lights and a Warn Zeon (10k) winch as well.  Caution:  The Zeon winch requires the grinding away of metal ears on both sides of the jeep body where the bumper mounts otherwise the winch will not line up with the winch holes on the Smittybilt bumper.  I used a metal grinder my friend let me borrow.  The whole setup looks bada$$ and works well -- haven't tried it on the trails yet but plan to go to my favorite Offload park to test out everything.

not as good as OEM of course but it will do the job. the air filtration is thick and material is good. i am sure you can find better quality part with higher prices but this will do the job as the others will do. I like to buy 2 cheap ones instead of 1 expensive and tap lace it more often. one little advice do not forget the clean the air filter box in the car with a wet towel to eliminate collected dust and particles when you are changing. it will make a huge differencemy car is 2003 lexus es300 and it fits perfectly

I used this in a 2004 ford ranger after taking it apart and trimming the bottom corners to clear the seatbelts. The fit, function and style was nice. See pictures on modifications.  I cut the center 20% and armrest off the original 60/40 seat and installed this one to because it was larger and taller.

I installed my 2500 awning on my new 2016 2500 express van by mounting it to 3 of my VanTech roof rack gutter mounts. It looks as though the racks and awning were meant for each other. I drilled  6 holes in the gutter brackets after centering and deciding the height I wanted. bolted it up and deployed it by myself in less than an hour. Now I have instant shade at the job site or parked on the causeway.

I've purchased and used this product before with great results , so when I grazed a green fencepost with my truck I knew which product to buy . It would be great to have the rubbing compound and scratch remover in something other than foil packets , but I save the leftover in a small screw top jar to use again . You have to be patient with each step; the more complete you are in each step, the better the results . I attached photos of before and after . I waxed the area at the end of the process (wax *not* included in kit).

I like these, they don't look cheap. It gave my truck the look I was after with the glossy sheen. There are concerns, This doesn't cover the edge so if you have a lighter colored truck you will see the paint on the edges. What I did was use a black marker to cover that up. Worked nicely.They're thick, especially with that tape on the back. Over an 1/8". The edge is cut at 90 degrees so it's kinda sharp. I use care when sliding my hand on it while shutting  the door.

For a 1/4 of the price of a on brand one this is a steal. I installed onto a borg Warner S252SXE T3 turbo on my 2006 STI. got perfect and once it got hit it shrunk to the hot side of the turbo exactly how it should. It did a great job of keeping heat down in the engine bay and away from my AOS.

Really nice material. But will say after purchasing this bag we found a samsonite bag that offers the same amount of cargo space and has better materials at Costco. Oh and cheaper too! The straps on the samsonite are thicker and much easier to adjust, the samsonite bag has a soft bottom to not damage your paint, the samsonite bag is also waterproof and does not have the same wind noise this bag has.10/13/16 UPDATE:I first purchased this cargo bag, didn't even use it and returned it. I went to a local warehouse store (rhymes with Bosco), saw a similar bag (Samsonite) for much cheaper and what looked to be better quality. Man, was I wrong. The water proofing material on the inside of this Bosco bag started to deteriorate after two uses. Luckily Bosco has a good return policy. Anyway, fast forward to last week. We needed to head up to Aberdeen for my sons baseball tournament and we were in desperate need of another bag. Figured I give this one another go. Even got bold and purchased an Amazon warehouse deal. Thing was practically brand new. Well Hurricane Matthew arrived and we needed to head out regardless. Like Leonidas, we will put the Keeper name to the test.On the way to Baltimore, torrents of rain came from all directions of the compass rose. The whole trip the keeper bag went through every kind of rain there is. Little bit of stinging rain, big ol fat rain, rain flew in sideways and sometimes rain even came straight up from underneath. Once at our destination, we didn't know what our luggage would look like. To our amazement, everything was bone dry. This bag is well worth every penny, light years ahead of the Samsonite bag and we hope it will stand the test of time. Upgrading from 3 stars to 5!4/17/17 UPDATE:While fresh and new this bag could withstand the hurricane/nor'easter types of rains, it has failed the test of time. After each use we would take this bag and neatly store it away in our garage. I saw creases starting to form but the waterproofing material on the inside didn't deteriorate. Man I was wrong. This past weekend we went on a 7 hour trip. On the return trip we ran into some rain. When unloading I noticed one of our suitcases was soaked. After further inspection, I find the waterproofing within the bag deteriorated. You can now see completely through the bag. I would not recommend past 6-8 uses.

This is NOT a neoprene Airhawk, the sellers description is WRONG!  If you received an Airhawk with a red air valve, like I just received today, that is new cheaper version of the Airhawk. It is polyurethane and are called Airhawk2. A real neoprene Airhawk has a black air valve and the material is thick rubber like a bicycle inner tube!I know what I am talking about as I still have my old neoprene Airhawk, and was hoping to replace it with the same neoprene Airhawk. You can easily tell the difference as the poly material is thin and the neoprene is thick.If I wanted a poly, I would have looked for and bought a poly!I demand a full refund.

Light and strong.  2 piece helps you carry, store and also get under car when it's on ramps as you can remove the back half.  A lowered Mustang easily clears the 56".  Make it a point to check that the pieces are back together before backing down.  Car sits stable when all the way at top.  Only 4 stars because the material is softer than competitors and if you don't hit it straight on, you'll alter the form - it is like a hard foam.

Word of advise. I read many reviews of this type of product where one of the visors (to be specific the rear passenger side) does not stick in place.The same thing happened to me. It appears to be a manufacturing defect (the passenger rear is not molded correctly).I tried several times and this particular side did not stick. I did follow the manufacturers installation instructions perfectly (all the other visors worked perfectly).I wedged some cardboard in the inside of the window pushing the glass "outward" to see if I get them to stick. I will let it be for a couple of days and will updated then. If it does not work, I will ask for a refund.They look great on my 2016 GMC Canyon with the short bed. But this may no be worth it.

If this seemingly sturdy visor had cost say $30 or more, than I likely wouldv'e given only 4 stars, for the reason that I ended up having to cut a piece of material to bridge the very noticable gap between the factory visor and this extender.  But since this extension only cost a mere $10.29, it is deserving of the full 5 stars for overall value, function, simplicity, and quality.It was super easy to install though I had to pull somewhat firmly on the velcro strap to get the tight fitting "U" hook fully over my thick visor edge.  But once positioned/centered properly, it's ready to go.I just leave my factory visor up all the time, and use only the tinted extension as the full-time visor.  The first picture is only to show the installed visor and gap piece (don't pay attention to brightness here).  The second picture is pasted from two different pictures to realistically show what my neighbor's driveway and house look like through this visor (again, don't pay attention to the over bright street itself - it's not true to the actual brightness...only the home, vehicles, and driveway).In summary, this visor is a VERY affordable and nicely-working item that I would highly recommend.  Why pay more for a similar item that very likely won't work as well, may break easily, and just plain is not worth it???Update:  After a weekend of my vehicle sitting in +90 heat, the visor would not stay in the up position - it'd droop in the full down position.  I was not happy and was thinking RETURN.  I then removed it and peered in the end of the hinge and noticed a Phillips screw head and just slightly tightened the screw enough so that it once again stays where you position the visor.  So for the reviewer who commented that it wouldn't stay up, this is the remedy.

I just put these tires on my 2000 Toyota Solara v6 size 215/50R17 about 1week ago. It just snowed in NJ and I wanted to see how they grip in snowy weather. Well I will tell you guys i have rode on Falkens, Toyo, Accelera, Michelins and tiger paw tires! These are quiet in dry and grippy in snow. I'm very impressed with these tires. These are very comparable to the all season Michelins tires for way less money! People remember to get a wheel alignment and Balance your tires properly or any tire on any car will NOT perform right! You can look at your old tires when you remove them and see if they are wearing EVENLY especially in front tires. Remember summer tires regardless of price or brand are NO good in snow, I learned the hard way sliding all around on fairly new summer tires in snow and slush, very scary! These are true all-season tires!

5 seconds out if the package as I push the ball mount pin into its hole, the coating on the pin scrapes off in a half in section. It just seems like Curt could do a better job on locking pin set that seems priced high as it is. I wouldnt mind paying a premium if I was to get a premium product. Also, the rubber boots that cover the key holes seem flimsy and not long for this world. It's probably not worth the time to send back but might if I can find something better.Update 2/4/183rd time using the hitch and like I figured the flimsy key hole cover broke. And more chrome was peeing off the pin. It's probably all gone now but so far no rust.

Love these bars! Got them for my 2003 Honda Rebel and they really changed the overall look and feel of the bike. Easy to drill into if you have controls with tabs that go into the handlebars (most bikes do). Do yourself a favor and don't cut those tabs off, take your time and drill into the bars and attach them properly.

Easy install and very secure. Would be 5 star if the package actually said what vehicle what bag of hardware is for. Pretty sure 2 out of 3 of the bags are identical. I just hope the finish last through the tough Florida summer.  Note of advice, in the photo I have the handle on the inside, this allows the hood to open a bit further but it blocks the windshield washer fluid spray a little bit so I flipped it around. Either way, you can open the hood all the way to prop with the OEM hood prop stick.

Opened the box and noticed the screen itself is much sturdier than I thought it would be. Overall I was impressed with the build quality. When I went to put it on my bike, the arms were not long enough as my bike has the speedo and tach mounted up in front of the bars. Turned out not to be a big deal, I went to The Depot and got some 3/8" steel rod and made my own bars to mount it. After a ride everything stayed put and kept all the wind off my chest. The downside is it moved all that wind to my helmet and had some serious buffeting at highway speeds. So I probably won't be using it like I thought I would, but still a well made product at a good price. My bike is a 79 Suzuki GS750 which has a pretty upright riding position, so this could contribute to my head being up over the screen. The box was well packaged with styrofoam and came early.

I bought this for an '08 Xterra. The good news is the pieces fit and seem to be thoughtfully and well made. The bad news is the instructions and videos for installation are for a Frontier, not the Xterra. While the two vehicles share a chassis and powertrain, there are enough differences between them that at some points of the installation, someone with an Xterra is going to find the instructions misleading and useless. Apparently, from what the company rep eventually admitted, the company tested the installation on a Frontier, and assumed the installation would be the same for an Xterra. But, it's not, as I found out the hard way.The problem I ran into is that the Xterra has an emissions evap canister mounted in the rear-most part of the left rear wheel well, which prevents the kit's outboard shackle bracket, which has the crush tubes attached, from being re-inserted into the mounting holes on the frame and spring. Nissan's original shackles have the tubes attached to the inboard bracket, probably for this very reason.After a couple of phone calls, mailing pictures to tech support and still more phone calls, the tech guy admitted they had not installed this kit on an Xterra so were unaware of the issue. Their only solutions were; a) remove the evap canister to provide the needed room or b) return the kit to Amazon for a refund. Since I had the kit mostly installed at that point the latter option made no sense to me. And the work and risk of possible additional issues from removing the evap canister, with all its cables and hoses, weren't very appealing either. At that point I'd already spent two days working on this install in my garage and didn't think I should have to waste more time and effort because of a mistake the company had made. I requested they send me a different rear shackle kit, one which conformed to the manufacturer's design, but they refused.Then I asked if it would be okay to cut the tubes off the outboard bracket plate to make assembly easier. The tech said that some of the kits they send out don't even have those tubes attached to the shackle plate anyway, so he didn't see why that would not work. So, that's what I did and it worked okay.So, after 3 days of struggling with this installation it is finally done and I just need to get the front end re-aligned. Some of that excessive time was because both lower rear shock bolts were frozen in place, would not come loose, and I had to cut them out and replace the bolts. When I look around at my garage and see all the tools I ended up having to use for this job, I concluded that; a)this installation is best left to a shop that can lift the vehicle high enough to work under safely, b) many home mechanics are going to lack the full set of socket and box-end wrenches, breaker bar, impact wrench, pry bars, cutting tools and lifts and jacks necessary to do this job and c) the installation instructions and videos clearly misrepresent the ease of installation for this kit - particularly for the Xterra.For this much money, the hardware in the kit is clearly over-priced, particularly when the company's customer support is so poor.

They work. I'm not sure how close they resemble the factory ones but they do plug in and do their job. The reason for 4 stars is they are not terrible snug when you twist them into place and if you are trying to wrestle the lift underneath they can fall out. Otherwise these are pretty much a 'must-have' when lifting your C7. Pics below show the use of hockey pucks to catch the pads and lift arm.

it goes on so easy and you can buff it off just as easy.  It has a silky feel to it.  I paid little more for it than the name brands but, it's worth it!  My 2008 Ford Mustang never looked so good!  Definitely  recommend !UPDATE:  I really do love this wax!  I have a lot of different waxes, sealants, etc and I find myself going back to P21S!  It's so easy to put on and buff off.  I don't know about longevity but, if your going out on the town, your car will shine like glass!  You don't have to apply very much.  Like I said, I find myself going back to this wax to make my car shine!  It's almost like a silky, soft paste wax, so a little more work than a spray wax but not as much as other paste wax's.  P21S doesn't stain your plastics either.  It's like Goldie Locks.... Just right.UPDATE:  I have been using this for some weeks now.  I have to say that out of all the waxes I own,.. Which a lot... I am constantly coming back to P21s.  I even sometimes prefer it to the spray waxes because I can control this better.  It works as good as the paste waxes but is so easy to wipe on and off.  It really shines my car!  If you could only have one wax in your life,  I would recommend this one.  Look at all the 5 star reviews!LAST UPDATE:  BUY THIS WAX!! OMG!! Yes, I had to go there...lol... Again, this wax is in a league of its own.  I feel unless you clay your whole car, this wax is show car quality.  Again, look at the totaltality of the reviews.  92% + love this wax!  I would do a commercial for them.  I read the reviews for products every time I buy on Amazon (current review scandal not withstanding) and this wax consistently receives 5 stars.  Like I said before...Buy this wax, at least once and you will see why all of us are raving about it! Peace

The rear fits snug and takes a few days to lay flat on the edges. Overall I am very satisfied.I read a lot of reviews on these liners and was concerned about the back seat liner not laying flat. Therefore, I waited about 1 week to see how it did before I wrote my review. It has been in the 20s here for the last week so not much heat to allow the plastic to take its original shape. But, after a week all three pieces have taken their desired shape. The pic of the rear that I am posting is right after installation, the second image of the rear is about a week after install. It does lay flat better. The back corner doesnt lay flat because I didn't open that does for a few days and the lip got above my doorThese mats do work with the under seat storage box seen in my last pic.

Got this for my mazdaspeed 6. It'll fit with some persuasion. A second pair of hands would make it much easier. You'll also have to trim the ends after you bolt it on. Other than that, it's pretty nice for the price.

So essentially I've learned that this product uses hydroplaning of the clay to pick up foreign fragments that causes your car's paint to feel gritty (even after washed).When I first found out about "claying" a car I was ecstatic. My pre-owned car looked nice but it didn't look or feel spectacular. I picked a kit up at my local AutoZone and watched a few videos to find out the best techniques for claying a car.I grabbed a kit,thoroughly washed my car but left it wet after the final rinse: got a bucket of water out and went to work. In about 2 hours my entire car was as smooth as glass to the touch. I was so amazed and in love with the results! My 10 year old car- YES 10 years old- looked and felt like a 2012/13 model! It was the very first time my car had ever been clayed so it only made sense to me that it would take so long.SPRAY:I found out that using water as lubrication instead of the spray that comes with the kit is generally a better choice (in my opinion). The spray left a residue and I couldn't work fast enough wipe it down after I used it. Yeah, that residue took 2 more washes to get off.Also the spray smells minty - in a weird way.after claying it I rinsed it again (to get rid of any water marks) then dried it and continued to polish/wax it.TIME:After this initial 2hr job I only needed to clay my car for 45 minutes or so every 4 1/2 months. I live in the city so my car is often exposed to airborne pollution and debris from construction.Tips:***EDIT: NOV 2016 Please Read-I suggest using a bucket of water or a spray bottle with NORMAL SOAPY water for lubrication (think bubbly, but not gobs of foam)If your water is too soapy the clay starts to melt, but yes, slightly soapy water does work better- I've experimented a couple of different times. Just don't use dirty soapy water. I still don't use the spray (I've now clayed about 6 different cars multiple times each), but find, as others suggested, soapy water to be a better fit.**You need to keep the area you're claying/barring, nice and lubricated as much as possible- if you're using soapy water have a microfiber towel on hand to squeeze water over the area after every few swipes of the clay.-Your car's body must be spotless before you clay it (wash the car but don't dry it) dry it after you clay it and rinse it-you can clay the windows too!-If you want to test the texture of your car's paint after it is washed run your fingers gently down the hood and on various parts of the body. If your fingers catch a little bit and you can feel debris you should clay your car. To amplify your sense of touch put a ziploc bag over your hand and then feel around.-get rid of any bracelets, belts,watches, rings etc when detailing your car; many times people do not notice that they press themselves against the body when detailing and thus run the risk of scratching up the paint.-Polish then wax your car after you have clayed it to seal out any debris and to bring out the best shine in the paintThe clarity and texture of the paint on my car was greatly improved after claying it :)- I don't think my paint could be clearer________________**1st pic of 05' Mazda clayed only, 2nd pic of '05 Mazda clayed then polished, 3rd pic is a '08 Sebring clayed and waxed, and finally the 4th picture is of a Porsche 968 95' after being clayed, polished, and waxed. All cars had glass smooth paint afterwards!

It works with a few small issues.  From another website they state it will work on a Wayne Dalton opener. It does, however, the laser stays on all the time. It does not turn off. The beam is a bit weak but once my girlfriend  found out approximately where she needs to be when pulling in to the garage then the laser will "bring her home".  No more pulling up too far!

I bought this kit for my 1999 Lincoln Navigator RWD as the 90006 kit for the Navigator had way too many bad reviews about the rear end sagging and not restoring the vehicle to a "normal" ride height. This 90010 kit was listed for a 4WD Expedition with 4 corner airbags.  My Navigator being a RWD only had airbags in the rear, the front already had coil springs from the factory. I replaced the system with coil springs because I had a driver's side rear airbag slowly leaking from dry rot. Being 14 years old, I decided to do the coil spring conversion mainly because I was afraid something else in the system would end up failing within the year like the lines or compressor.Installation was fairly easy on the rear. The front took some modification in order to use the coil-over shock that was included in the kit.I would advise for someone with my situation to just get the rear springs and shocks in the kit and order front shocks separately as the coil-over shocks for the front is not needed if you already have coil springs in the front.  If you decide to use the coil-over shocks, installation is a pain as far as getting the coil-over shock inside the coil spring. You will have to buy what they call a "shock relocation mount" for mounting the bottom of the coil-over shocks.  Factory uses a cross pin mount as to where the coil-overs use a bolt. I bought some 11 gauge, 1/4" thick, 2x2 inch wide angle iron ($7) and fabricated my own bottom mounts to adapt the Navigator to these coil-overs with use of the factory coil springs along with a couple of bolts, nuts, and washers ($15). A outer spring compressor was real handy for doing the front. Rented it from Autozone for about $55.As far as the "check suspension light", I have seen 3 different ways of disabling that. The method I used was to pull the #109 fuse (red 50A, air compressor power) from under the hood in the distribution box and then take the cluster out and remove the bulb for the light. It is important to leave the air suspension switch on after your install or your EVO system will not work correctly with the steering assist and steering will be real touchy at highway speeds.Using the 4WD Expediton Kit on my RWD Navigator gave me about 2 inch of lift in the front and 3 inches in the rear. The construction of the springs is nice, pretty stiff. So far, being only a couple of days since the install, I am very happy with product. Rides real nice. Again, this was converting a RWD air ride system to a 4WD coil spring system. Any questions, feel free to leave a comment.

Easy to paint. You can put it as far forward or as far back as you want. No drilling and installation maybe took 5 minutes. Mine is holding a 52" straight bar. Looks great and when tightened it's extremely solid. Thanks for a great product!

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:  In the photos you will see that the JDM ASTAR's have a whiter light.  Whiter light may "appear" brighter however the light does not travel as far.  This means a whiter light with a short distance versus a more yellow light with a further distance from incandescent bulbs.I have ordered JDM ASTAR LEDs before and was very happy so I decided to give these a try for my reverse lights in my RAM 1500. These bulbs are ENORMOUS!  They do fit my tail light housing but they look awful inside. I did a comaparison and and the stock incandescent bulbs are brighter than these. I'll be sending them back for a refund.

When it arrived the box looked pretty bad. Opened it up and it looked to be undamaged. After I had it on I noticed a couple of light scratches. It was really easy to put on the 2014 Edge. All you do is remove 4 push pens holding on the rubber weatherstripping. You slide the defector between the rubber and the hood and line up the holes. I used the factory push pens and it worked great. It would be a 5 star review if it were scratch free. You would need to look hard to find the scratches, but I had rather start with no scratches. I took a 2 hour interstate drive the day after I put it on. I seemed to get less bugs on my windshield than before. I would buy it again, and would recommend to a friend.

Doesn't fit very tight in receiver and fades quickly in the sun but otherwise works well as a step if you add some grip tape or something else for grip.... Don't think I'd trust it for a recovery point.

So the first one of these I got in the mail had a decent scratch on the lower left. The second one looked damaged too, but I rubbed the blemishes pretty hard with my finger and it came off. Not sure what it was. It was a residue of some sort.I bought some 3M extreme mounting tape from Lowe's rated for outdoors and up to 30 lbs, because I don't want this thing flying off on the highway. Aside from the first damaged one, and this one arriving dirty, on top of the weak mounting tape..... It looks great!

It fits great in my 2018. I already love it and haven't had the chance to drive with it yet!! lol its a snug fit so nothing will slip through. I was worried about it bunching up when the seats moved due to another review I read but it moves smoothly with the seats. One thing I noticed is the driver side hangs over the side of the seat, whereas the passenger side lines up-- shown in pics. I'll probably be buying one for my husband now, just love it!

FIts nicely on the passenger seat of my Mercedes 500SL. See the photos. The seat section could be a few inches longer to fully cover the front of the seat. But you kind of have to get down in the footwell to see the straps. The pile is nice and tall and comfortable. The headrest cover in the photos is not included. It is from a neoprene seat cover set.

Used this for my 01' Ranger.Looks good and is about a 20 minute installation. It also brings the radio up MORE flush with the bezel... so you have a less recessed look. I actually prefer it to be more flush so this was awesome! Looks less out of place. You have to do a little trimming on the upper and lower bezel but overall this kit holds the double din radio in VERY solid. It doesn't move at all once you screw it into the side pieces. The adjust ability is nice, if you prefer a more recessed look. I believe there are 3 positions for you to adjust where you can fit the front trim piece.Get this kit if you have a Ranger and want a pretty easy install and have it look good...The reason I took one star off was because along the outline of the face plate you can see a small gap all the way around. Not a problem for most and if they made it maybe 1-2mm wider this wouldn't be an issue and be more of a finished look. The inner part of the front face trim you can see casting marks as well... small piece of sand paper takes these off  for a smooth finish.-Nigel

On my car, on my sideview mirror, I noticed that the paint was quite faded the last time I washed my car, which was last week. I already had Meguiar's Ultimate Compound on hand so I grabbed a microfiber towel, poured some of the product on the towel, and rubbed in a fast, circular motion.Maybe like 20 seconds of rubbing, the finish was restored! I was happy to see that it indeed did work and wasn't a gimmick. I will upload photos to show the end result.So a week later, the finish is still as good as it was when I first applied the product.  Next up is my rear bumper!Great product and I do recommend it for restoring faded portions

I have purchased this kit based on the reviews.The good:Solid build qualityGreat packing and presentationEasy installation, plug and playThe bad:The main reason why I purchased this kit was to upgrade my visibility and have some nice looking headlights. Well stock is at least 3 times brighter than this, even my fog lights witch they are just led cree bulb, are way brighter and cheaper. For that price this is just a rip off, at this point I'm considering to return them. At this point I'm sure there is many fake reviews about this product,

This is a SOLID heavy gauge steel mounting plate that fits perfectly in the Rubicon's Hard Rock stock bumper. It took me a total of about 4 hours installation by myself. Pretty simple install process and I could probably do it now in a couple hours. I read somewhere that it took 2 dudes something like 12 hours but they must have been blindfolded and tool ignorant because this thing was a piece of cake.NOTE: It comes with all applicable hardware. Use the 2 big bolts for the sides and the existing bolts in the factory bumper for the front mounting position. The only thing you will have to trim / grind off is the front arm of the vacuum canisters original mount. I just reused the rear arm of that same mount to reinstall the vacuum canister. (You really only need one bolt to hold it in place and upright).Yes I think it's kind of silly to shell out a couple hundred bones for a piece of steel but it's made specifically for the Hard Rock bumper and this one is the lowest price point I could find. Others are selling the EXACT same thing for about $40 more... which is silly. You're not going to fabricate something better so just get the correct thing that fits perfectly. It's a no brainer.Easy peasy. I should have made a youtube vid of it but didn't bother. I mounted a Smittybilt XRC 9500 winch which fit perfectly.

I've been using Wheel Wax for about a year now. For the first application, I applied two coats.  Now, I apply one coat every three months when I wax my Camaro. I recommend clay baring and polishing to a high luster before using Wheel Wax. But it does have a polishers built in to keep your wheels looking great for months. It is easy to apply and leaves a very slick surface.Does it keep your wheels cleaner?  No, and you shouldn't believe that a protective coating will keep brake dust from settling on your wheels. However, cleaning brake dust off your wheels is much easier. It provides a barrier of protection so contaminants don't bond to the clear coat.I notice that as long as I keep a coat of Wheel Wax applied on a regular bases, my wheels look great with no need to polish or clay between applications.  The gloss is fantastic and seems to last for months. Highly recommended, especially if your wheels are already clean and polished to a high gloss. In this condition, application and removal is super easy.

The plastic key case for my 2004 RX330 had a hairline fracture that was compromising the structure of it over time.  I was worried that the metal key itself wasn't T-shaped.  Luckily, it was.  The transmitter guts and metal key fit perfectly, and the case closed snug and tight.I went on ebay and bought some small lexus emblem stickers to finish it off.  Only thing that would make this OEM looking is if they added the "UNLOCK" and "LOCK" inscriptions, just like in the original keys.

The fit was good. The color matched good. Cutting the inserts for the switches was easy. Just use a sharp utility knife and do multiple scores with it to cut through, if not then you might cut through an area that you don't want to cut.  There is also an up side and a bottom side to the inserts.

I rented this OEM 27031 kit from Autozone.  The puller tool, that removes the pulley, worked OK to remove an old damaged, power steering pulley that I needed to replace.  But the pulley installer tool broke when I attempted to press-on a new pulley.  The 3/8 -16 forcing screw bent severely and I could not complete the pulley install.  As with almost all Autozone rental tools - they show signs of wear and abuse.  And I have to carefully inventory the pieces while in the store.  I did not notice the thread damage on the 3/8 inch forcing screw - so I had to clean up the 3/8-16 threads before using.  After making repairs, I attempted to install the pulley and I discovered that the forcing screw was bending with more pressure - I stopped using this kit and gave it back to Autozone.  Out of curiosity, I checked the specs on the interference fit between the power steering shaft size and the pulley ID.  Wow, I calculated over 0.002 inch interference fit.  I also verified the shaft size and pulley hole inner diameter sizes by making measurements with Starrett micrometers - both parts were at their published, nominal dimensions ( or were correct in dimensions - based on the manufacturers specs).  IMO, I concluded that I am faced with a VERY tight press fit - offering an explanation for why the installer tool failed.  Based on some published data (design data for heavy press fits) and my experience, I would expect an interference fit of something about 0.0014 - 0.0015 inch interference fit.  In my case, the power steering pump  is made by AC Delco and DORMAN makes the pulley.  None-the-less, the OEM27031 did NOT work for my application.  So, I believe your success rate for using this tool will be very dependent on the details of the interference fit between the shaft and pulley.  The OEM 27031 appears to be intended to be used for lightweight interference fits.  Otherwise, don't be surprised when you bend or break this tool.Update 4/2016I built my own installer tool.  My first attempt was simply using some 3/8-16 inch all-thread with a nut and washer.  The pulley installed about 1/4 of the final depth before the 3/8 threaded rod bent severely.  And while tightening the nut, the 3/8 rod would unthread.  I severely bent the 3/8 inch threaded rod and stopped.  So, for my 2nd attempt, I welded a section of 3/8-16 inch all-thread rod to the end of some M14 -1.5 all-thread rod.  I also welded a nut on the end of the 14mm section  - to hold the M14 forcing screw during use.  See photo.  Both threaded rods were from mild steel threaded rods - no special alloys.  I bought a thrust bearing also.  This allows the 14mm nut used to press the pulley forward - and minimize friction at the pulley.  Without it - as you tighten the nut on your 14mm rod forcing screw -  the reaction force will unthread the forcing screw from the power steering shaft.  The thrust bearing is a critical component.  I modeled my installer tool after a photo I found of a OEM puller for my Ford Ranger (T65P-3A733-C w/ cost about $75).  This 2nd pulley install tool worked well and I was able to install the pulley smoothly and easily.  But you buy this OEM 27031 kit so you don't have to build your own tools!  No doubt that the pulley installer included this kit is a flawed design.  It uses only a single size 3/8 -16 inch threaded rod - and it can fail on tight interference fits.  Based on my success of building my own pulley installer - the OEM 27031 needs a much larger forcing screw diameter.  Bottom line - I don't recommend this OEM27031 for power steering pulley installations.Conclusions/Summary- your success using this kit depends greatly on the details or specs of your interference fit.  The number of positive reviews may be meaningless.  And these very tight interference fits means you risk breaking a pulley by attempting to remove it.- the point of building my own tool was not to demonstrate how clever I think I am - but I was frustrated.  I was left thinking "I have to spend $75 to get a quality tool that can install a power steering pulley?"  BTW, I calculate material cost me about $5-6 for my pulley installer.  And you have to factor in that I own welding tools (and everyone knows welding tools are expensive). I posted a photo of my installer tool.- if I can rent a tool and give it a test drive AND I like it - I will buy the tool.  It takes valuable time to travel back and forth to Autozone and stand in-line.- this is the 2nd OEM puller/installer tool I have broke.  In my opinion, OEM makes cheap, lightweight tools that break.

Had very little issues installing and it looks amazing. Pretty easy to drill and mount the frame and supports itself, however, I did see what other reviews meant by having issues putting back on. Normally, your grille just slides on the top once the bottom clips are secured. But with the support holding the insert against the grille this will hit the body and cause it to be tight. Not a big deal, I used a door panel puller (you can use a large flathead) to lift and place above the frame and held it there as I put the push pins back in. This was on a 2012 JK.

This is one of the best sets of auxiliary lighting I have ever used.  The beam pattern makes a perfect fog light to run all the time, it is wide and flat with a sharp cutoff to prevent blinding oncoming traffic.  The first set of these replaced the factory fog lights on my Dodge Ram, they fit the factory holes well with the Rigid brackets (dodge specific, purchased separately).  These are much brighter than my factory fog lights were.  The second set is on my Bronco, where the 29 year old plastic lenses are junk and these supply most of the low beam for regular driving.I have been impressed by all of the Rigid Industries product that I have used: 2 sets of Duallys, 1 set of D2 driving, 1 20" SR combo bar, and now 2 pairs of these Dually SAE fog lights.  I don't necessarily love the price compared to the Chinese made knock off options, but the Rigid products are made in USA, specifically AZ where I live.  Side by side the Rigid products significantly outperform the fakes, my 20" SR bar is brighter and has better throw than my buddy's Chinese 30" dual row bar.

I have mixed feelings about these bags. I replaced a set of Dowco teardrop shaped sport saddlebags with these. The Dowco's held more stuff and were fairly waterproof, even without the rain covers. I bought these bags in order to match the tail bag I had purchased, since they were a "system" but let me tell you... these things are not nearly as "water resistant" as they are advertised to be. In fact, without the built in day-glo rain covers (which ARE nice to have), these bags allow even the lightest sprinkling of rain in. You better use a waterproof liner if you have anything that needs to be kept dry. IF you have enough forewarning to put the rain covers on, you're good but get caught in a sudden down pour and your stowed gear is damp, at the least. Over all, for the price (and for the fact that all my soft-sided luggage now matches) I'd say it was a good buy. Just be aware of the weather and if you even THINK it's going to rain, deploy the rain covers.

This replacement has worked very well for me and allowed me to refurbish both of my existing FOBs, both of which had disintegrated.  These FOBs were for a 2010 Chevrolet CamaroFive stars would have been if the swap involved no modifications and was a drop in replacement.  These have worked well, and allowed me to use my original blade and board, but that required some modifications of the shell.I originally tried to use the OEM back to maintain the Chevron on the FOB, but that ultimately failed, as the back was not a snap in replacement to the new FOB.  I have had no issue since reverting back to the new back.

I am an auto dealer and I purchased one of these for my personal 08 Ducati 1098, and everything seemed ok until less than 100mi of use, the filter ripped the threads off the nipple on the engine and dumped all the engine oil all over the bike during riding.  Upon further inspection, the filter was only catching 1 thread and had actually ripped that single thread off the bike!!  Contacting K&N for warranty as this is an obvious manufacturing defect and a known problem, they refused to warranty the failure and damage to the bike and will not return my calls!!! K&N actually even acknowledged that it would only engage 1 thread!  Shame on you, K&N! My customers and I will NEVER waste our money on k&n again.  Totally unacceptable!!  You are literally risking your life using these filters and you will need a lawyer when they fail as K&N will do nothing for you.

These LEDs look somewhat cheesy on an older vehicle during the day, but they light up the road ALOT better than the old sealed halogens. While these LEDs are bright they also throw light all over the road, somewhat like a spotlight even after adjusting the aim conservatively. While my set still function(mostly), I seem to have lost low beam on one of my lights(very dim). The same defective LED light works fine when I hit the high-beams though. It's just annoying after only 5 months I have an issue with one of the LEDs, I guess that's what comes from GENSSI having most products being rebranded Chinese lights..I have some pictures below but my phone's camera doesn't show in person justice.

I love my new license plate frame... I actually got all 3 colors because I love metallic finishes, but I just couldn't choose. I really like how there is just enough bling from the rhinestones that it's elegant, but not over the top. I may get it engraved too because there is space at the bottom so you can personalize it.

NOT ALL METAL!!! The handle itself is plastic, and will fail exactly like the factory ones do, where the plastic arm breaks off.However, this wasn't me reason for failure. The metal retaining bracket on mine bent. That said, I was able to disassemble mine (which had previously been replaced with a Dorman which IS completely metal, including the handle) and combine the new internals with my existing metal handle. Also, see the attached photos of the gouges on the plastic handle. This handle arrived with these scratches and gouges already there.I ordered this based upon the SELLER'S DESCRIPTION that this was an all metal part. That was a LIE.The part will work, but I'm rating one star because the seller is dishonest and misleading in their description.BTW, I have over 25 years of automotive repair experience, so I know what I'm talking about...save the hassle and buy the Dorman ALL METAL handle. Mine only bent due to someone using excessive force to yank on the handle.Two of the pics show the damage to the cheap plastic handle.One pic shows the handle before I disassembled/combined the parts.Last pic shows the rear of the each of the handles themselves. You can see the obvious mold lines in the cheap plastic one compared to the metal one. Also note the irony in the plastic handle lying on it's own packaging that clearly states "METAL" in all caps.

These tips were beautifully crafted and were a perfect 7" long and 4" diameter as described; I hoped they would fit my car, but 7" was too long so I had to regretfully return them.  These may have worked great for an IS250 or IS350 with the ground effects (GFX) rear bumber, but my car has the standard bumper and needed a shorter tip.  Note that the actual product DOES NOT MATCH THE AMAZON PHOTO.  I will upload an accurate photo showing the actual tips.

This type of bulb is typically used as side marker lights on vehicles or other types of clearance or running lights. My camper has a total of four side markers lights. One bulb on the front and rear corners of both sides of the camper. There are also two more marker lights across the back of the camper. Two of them were burnt out and I decided to replace all of them with LED bulbs. I ordered these from Bulbeats because I know they make a good product. I recently replaced some of the interior bulbs in my camper with Bulbeats LED 1156 bulbs and am extremely pleased with the results. I also replaced the tail lights in my camper with Bulbeats 1157 bulbs. Why should I not be just as pleased with their 194 bulbs? These tiny marker lights have two tiny LEDs inside the end of them as well as four more around the outer sides. With this configuration of the LED chips light is distributed in all directions. The bulbs are very quickly replaced. Simply pull the old one out and push the other one in.  No special tools required in the installation of the light unless you need a screwdriver to remove the lens cover. The lights are a really bright white bulb. In comparison, the old incandescent bulbs are a yellow color. They show really well through the red and orange lens covers. I am super pleased with these bulbs. I knew that buying Bulbeats bulbs, I was getting a very bright, quality, bulb. I am very pleases, once again. I received these Bulbeats 194 bulbs at a discount, or free, for my unbiased testing and review. You cant go wrong with Bulbeats products.

This kit was exactly what I expected.  Extremely easy to install for somebody who has mechanical skills it is simple enough that someone who isn't mechanically inclined could do it. Overall very impressed have put about 50 miles on it so far. I also upgraded the Jets and the carb aftermarket air filter new CDI box and ignition coil and spark plug running full synthetic oil.  now the scooter is a beast compared to what it was. Definitely recommend this kit to anybody I am considering buying another kit for the wife's scooter.

Works as advertised and provides much needed (if not interesting) information about your devices and the charges they consume.  I also recommend the Smart Charge Data Block USB adapter... read my review there.  Both products work as advertised.  I also like how compact and storage friendly this is.  The cable wraps around the back of the unit and tucks neatly in.Two concerns with the quality of this product.  It arrives wrapped in a plastic bag, but the digital readout screen is badly scratched up and dulled.  Most products have a plastic rip-off screen protector (which I LOVE to remove), but this did not come with that protection and should have. SEE BELOW...I was wrong about this.Also, the vinyl insulation on the USB cable isn't tucked completely inside the housing so the internal USB wires are exposed.  There is no bare wire exposed, so it's not a safety concern, but the quality should be better in those two areas.

Work great, brighter than factory bulbs. I ordered wrong ones for backup lights, so these went in the stop lamps.  My bad. Will need resistors to solve the fast flash.**UPDATE** 7 months later, both are dropping out LED's and one even has a handful that flicker.  Yeah, don't want to get pulled ove for a flickering brake light.  Sure they will warranty them, but want me to send both back at the same time, then 2 days or so later they will ship out the replacements.  Meaning, I need to go to the store and buy 2 regular bulbs so I can drive my car while I wait for the replacements.  I used one old bulb for another car, and places here sell the bulbs in pairs, so yes, will need to spend some dough.  Went from 5 star, to 3 star in 7 months.

Looks goods on the truck. I'm not a fan of the 3M tape to be applied to the front edge of the hood. Water, Salt, and Freezing weather has the potential of doing more harm than good if trapped under any crease or bubble. Other than that it snaps on in about 5-10 mins. The OEM seal between under the front of the hood has a little bit of a gap, but not very noticeable unless you give it a close look. The AV stick on emblem is crooked, but unless you're ocd like me, it's not a big deal. Note: install the 4 metal screws with square fittings before the 2 plastic press-in fasteners. Pull the plastic screw out as much as possible before inserting it into the holes and use a screw driver to push them in, trying to thread them in will not work. They need to be pushed in. Overall I'm happy with the look and even more happy that I have a defense against bugs and rocks. Only negative is the 3M tape, time will tell if leaving it off does more harm than good. it looks like the very front edge is clear of the shield, but with air pressure while driving down the road, I'm not as confident.

1 Year old update: chrome underneath clear plastic trim has deteriorated; bubbling and peeling. (Garage kept vehicle; rarely parked outside)1 year ago: Looks good except for the scratches it came with.  I am very disappointed after I had installed three doors and the last one came with fine buff marks. I used a wet towel to clean them when I was done installing and it made them looks worse. The quality of the tinted plastic is poor.  I'll have to go with it as much as possible.

I bought these and installed them on a 2000 toyota rav4.  I mounted a straight 42" led light bar.  The fit isn't perfect but it works for my car.  But if I had a curved light bar then things would fit much better.  The only main issue I have is that I have to slam my door to shut it.  I'll probably have to shave off a little bit of metal from my door edge so that it doesn't come in contact with the brackets so I can close my door without having to slam it.

I was not thrilled with this product at first, however after making the correct adjustments I am very happy with it. I would give one piece of advice that will be the difference between it working and it not working. Don't be afraid to adjust your rods far back into the cleats/ clips. Placing them in the same position as they came stock left my tailgate still opening with the Pop & Lock "locked". The hooks that pull on the springs/pins of the tailgate should travel a distance before they even start to engage with each other. With these properly adjusted the Pop & Lock will lock your tailgate.

So this is the 2nd time i put a graphic on my rear window.  The last one, different brand, was on for 8 years, it had faded some and part of that was due to using too strong of a cleaner (just use regular soap btw).  I have been wanting to upgrade for sometime.#1 CON - One issue I had with this was that i was putting it on a rear window of a SUV, the glass is curved.  I had help putting it on (This i HIGHLY suggest) from someone that does a lot of work with decals.  Even so, we found putting it on the curved glass definitely had it's issues.  There is a spot that i just couldn't get it to lay down right, so there is a bit of a crease in it (actually, 2 small ones towards the bottom right corner).  This was when we already had 85% of it on the window, not much we could do to fix. We did work on it long enough that our arms were starting to give out: I'm old, my Dad help who is even older.So why did i give 5 stars when i still had that issue?  On a flat window, i'm sure this thing goes on perfect.  And, if you are standing back a couple feet, or 40 feet away, this looks awesome.  I really love the vintage style of it and with my Jeep being 18 years old, it's just perfect, love it against the Red paint (which is the original paint).

This helmet is rad! Especially for the price. The finish is nice and it fits like a glove. My noggin measures 58, so I bought the Medium per the sizing chart & it's perfect. I own over 20 helmets (different brands & styles) and the sizing of this one is right on. I think I have a pretty neutral head shape so I don't feel any pressure points at all with this helmet.For what it's worth on the fitment/shape, the newer Bell brand helmets don't fit me well. I believe they have a more round head shape. With a Bell, It's tight front to back but gapped on the sides above the temples. This CRG does not have that issue for me.With the shield wide open it whistles a bit, but not a big deal. Probably something to do with the wind blowing across the inside forehead vents. The chin strap is plenty long and has a little retaining button on it so it's not flopping all over the place; a thoughtful feature. Also, the CRG does not lift when riding and when I turn my head, it doesn't feel like the wind is going to snap my neck.The one thing I really, really disliked was how impossible the shield is to lift off the pin lock. Fortunately, I came up with a super simple, FREE fix that takes about 30 seconds and completely eliminates the only negative thing about this helmet. (Do a quick search on You Tube for "crg visor fix". It should be right at the top.)I bought a tinted shield for it & that isn't the greatest. It's not optically correct (at all) and it's slightly hazy. But, I ride a rigid Harley and I haven't ever seen anything clearly while riding it because my eyeballs are bouncing in their sockets! lol! I don't know if the clear shield that the helmet comes with is less distorted because I haven't used it or removed the static film protector from it.All said, I'm very happy with this helmet and would love to have another one in another color.

Recently I order 4 pairs of 20w run-D.2 flood and 2 spot, the problem is that I receive 3 flood pairs and 1 spot pair.Beside that I love the spot light. Is just the spot, doenst waste light around that could blind oncoming traffic, to bad i only receive 1 pair.Flood was specting to be more brighter but its ok.Will wait to hear from run-D support team what have to say about sending wrong items.Flood its ok but if i could go back on tiem will order only spot lights.When I install them will update on waterproof and mudproof test.UPDATE; JULY 10, 2016Support team contact me and give a free pair of spot led for the mistake of wraping the wrong pattern of light on a spot box.At the end I bought 4 pairs of spot pattern and 3 flood pattern.My recomendation is flood use for back up light or something at short distance.But the spot beam pattern you will love that lights.So far I have only install 1 pair of flood and 1 of spot and they do can handle a lot of mud and water (crossing rivers they got summerge and they do not have moisture) they do are waterproof.

I really wanted to give at least a 4 or a 5, but I cannot.  Here's the reason why (I've uploaded a few photos to show)Everything works, just some bad QC on their product.  One of my lights (h3 bulb) appears to be pointing upwards causing bad lighting.  You can see this on my photos where there's like a hot spot on-top of the beam.  It's quite annoying as I can't lower it or raise it.  It does not match the other lights pattern.  Since I have installed this item already, I do not know what Amazon's replacement policies are so I have contacted Hella directly on their website possibly for a replacement or ??? Let's see if they respond.  We'll just have to see.EDIT UPDATE 3-19-2013Updated to 4 stars, So Amazon has sent me a replacement unit, this time the lamps work correctly, no defective output.  I was surprised Hella responded back and said the warranty is honored at the purchasing retailer, i'm glad it was a NO HASSLE as usual with Amazon's service.5 stars now because it does the job, provides a lot of lighting for the money.  I also looked at similar lights from PIAA and they were not cheap.EDIT UPDATE: 7-7-2013I've been finding that the buss fuse burnt through the fuse holder and it melted (2 times!) and would my lights just just shut off (a good thing it didn't burn my wire and my car!). After some testing with my friend, we replaced it with a 15AMP regular fuse line.  I also switched the power (black) from the lamp back to the relay to a 10guage wire.  I think stock was more like 18guage (piece of junk!)as the stock black wire got pretty warm quickly and could also have possibly melted.  Our testing showed there was a slight drop in amperage so the relay and the fuse was taking a bit of a hit (thus heating up).  I think it's safer now and I was able to leave the lights on for  a much longer period of time this time without it burning out or melting the fuse.For $70+ this is some shotty engineering work on Hella's part.  Dropped Stars back to 3 for poor QC and Engineering work.

Nice and (White)bright as expected from JDM!  Almost too bright, lol.  I planned putting tint over the marker light I used it for, just haven't yet.  Once I do that it will be perfect.  JDM's lights are always White, if you buy other cheaper ones, they tend to have a blue color to them.  You can see the difference in the pictures, with led, and with normal OE bulb.

I used it on my Audi, and it brought out the shine nicely. Next day it rained, and it beaded the water nicely. I washed it the next day, and it still shined very nicely.

I actually used these AGPtek Grab Handles for the back roll bars to give me something to grab onto when climbing into the back of the Jeep.  I used them on a 2016 Jeep Wrangler 2 Door. The roll bar back there is pretty side but these still fit.  Since the grab handles have three Velcro straps it makes them super strong.  The material is a good quality nylon.  They were really quick and easy to install.  I'd highly recommend these grab handles to any Jeep owner.I received the product at a discount in return for my unbiased opinion.

Absolute junk. First time I tried to install, I was tightening the nut used to connect the bolt to the arm, and apparently I tightened it too much (which I really don't think I did at all). However, I should note that this did not happen with the other side and it looks like I would have to purchase an entire new set in order to remedy the situation. I can't even fabricate something new with having to pull the mirror apart. Ridiculous!!! I would return, but I have passed the allowed return date. $67 down the drain. Nice......

First and foremost, if you're looking for a dim bulb, look elsewhere.  You want bright???  Read on...Everyone takes pictures in the night for a bulb's luminosity.  My pictures show you how bright they are in the daylight.If I could promote a brand on here, JDM ASTAR put me on your payroll!  These bulbs are going on my 2012 Hayabusa.  We motorcycle riders have to be seen or we die.  This is my third brand of 7507 turn signals, I wasn't happy with the lumen output of the other two, my search is over!!!I like to check all LEDs are working before putting things back together.  DO IT WITH VERY DARK SUNGLASSES!!!  That dot you see after taking a very quick glimpse at the sun, these bulbs have the same effect, it's worse, you get multiple dots.  I'M BEING SERIOUS, and AM NOT putting other two on until I buy very dark sunglasses.  Yes, they are that bright!Camera and picture information:  Samsung Note II, Daylight setting, 8 pix/sec, taken Saturday morning 06/13/2015 around 7:20-ish in daylight while it's sunny out, and no photo enhancementsJDM ASTAR, keep it up!

Works perfectly as expected.  Used this to put a BOSS Audio BVNV9384RC Double Din Head Unit in my 2009 Pontiac G5. At first I thought the Front trim wouldn't fit with the head unit (which I had purchased at the same time so it was new to me), but then realized the BOSS HU had a front trim piece that was removable so it fit then.  Fits great.

I spent the time to cut each one out so that I could leave the backing on and slowly remove it as I placed it?.. Did not work lol... I ended up just removing each one fully then attaching.Went on fairly easy and looks good. Just take your time.Make sure you clean before each piece and one thing I did was made sure the overlap went in the direction of travel. If that makes sense. So there was only one connection that wasn't covered by the last as the wheel goes around. Probably not anything that would make a big diff just my thought process.The only reason I didn't give a 5 star was that you have to install 6 pieces per side. Not sure you could do it any other way without a screw up but you can kind of see the laps if you look. But at night they sure are bright when the lights hit um!

Best out there, simple as that. Used a lot of products but this is the best.1. It does not create a sticky texture at any point.2. The leather literally absorbs gel like a sponge.3. Minimal (if any) wipe-down after applying.4. It revives old leather and makes it feel plush, soft, and flexible.5. I use it on my Benz seats, leather jacket, couch, shoes etc.. Any leather.6. Example - Pic of my leather jacket; I globbed the gel on the whole jacket like frosting to a cake and did NOT wipe off a single bit. It feels like a whole new jacket.The stuff works. If I could 6 Stars, I would.

The locking pin completely sheared off within 3 months of very light use, maybe twice a month. Right where the lock attaches.  Submitted a complaint on Reese's website and received no response within a few weeks, now months.  I'm not sure how many trips I had made with basically no pin lock in place, but if you own this POS you need to replace it ASAP.**bought this at Wally world*****

From what I can see it's a well built fuse. It comes with a loop of 10 awg wire that you will have to cut to even begin stripping it and using it, so it's obviously for someone with tools, and knows what they are doing.No fuse included, but that's expected.Seems fairly water RESISTANT, but obviously don't leave it out in the rain. More for a humid, foggy day.

Thanks Rough Country.  Compared to the other kits that cost more, I'd have to say this was well worth the $250 price tag.I put this 3" lift on my 1997 Toyota 4Runner and it really made a difference in how it looks.  This was installed by a small town mechanic that only charges $50 an hour and he did a brake job for me at the same time and together it only cost me $300 for the work, also including an alignment.  I say that because I can't weigh in on what it was like to install the kit, only the after effects.But, the truck looks great and came up about 2" in front in 3.5" in back.  It's been fun to have a bit more height and clearance but not be too obnoxiously up in the air. She's driving stable and has made driving the 4Runner more fun for sure.- Jeff

WARNING!! DO NOT BUY THIS CLUB!!!! I read the bad reviews first and many said the put it on an then it was locked on and could not remove. I figure the majority reviews were good so I like the dark blue because they are hard to find. It arrived today. Took family out to Olive Garden for a night out to eat. I TRIED THE CLUB OUT FIRST!!  I extended it then unlocked it. Cool. We go inside to see people sitting on the floor and out the door a 1hr 30 min wait to eat. So we go back to the car and now on my brand new car i can't get this damn thing off!!! Tried every way possibe. Placing tension, removing tension while trying to wiggle the key. After 30 min off trying. A lock smith will run you anywhere from starting out at $100 up to$250. I had premier AAA membership and it covered a lock smith. Great! Except nearest lock smith is a hour out so total time sitting here will have been 2 hrs. DO NOT TAKE A CHANCE.

Not only are they stylish and unique (we haven't seen anyone in our area with anything similar on a Ford Fusion), but they also emit a beautiful, natural daylight that is indeed noticeable during the day. We haven't noticed any type of flickering with them. As you will see from my husband demonstrating them in the video, they look like they came with the car because they go so well.We thought that we'd have to get the whole bumper removed to install them, but luckily, a friend was able to install them without doing that. Instead, he put them up on a car lift (I don't know the technical term) and was able to get them in underneath the bumper. It took around an hour to get them installed (yes, we got a pro - didn't want to mess it up ourselves).The only ONE tiny little flaw we could find was that the lights don't fit the actual fog light area perfectly. You can see a tiny little gap on the ends (which I TRIED to show in my pictures) where they seem to be just a tad bit off/short. It's not at all noticeable, though, unless you're right up on them and even then, you wouldn't notice unless it was pointed out. It's no deal-breaker and certain doesn't affect the lights or how they look.We've had these on our 2015 Ford Fusion around 2-3 weeks now. If you are looking to change up yours, these are a great choice! Cool daytime running lights and a little extra brightness at night. Plus, the actual fog light is still there to help on those extremely foggy days.A free item was provided for evaluation and unbiased review.

i bought one of these to use in a diy radio project. originally, i thought the addition of the rocker switch cover would give it a more industrial feel, but i eventually opted to remove the cover and go with a bare switch. the cover comes right off, so its removal was no problem at all. the switch itself is also very easy to install. depending on your application, you can adjust the depth over 1/4" by moving the inner nut.wiring was pretty simple. i'm still convinced the labels are switched on the terminals, but there's only two possible ways this can be wired so it's easy to figure out. when i wire the switch up according to the labels, the led always stays on, but the switch still functions like normal (just upside-down). when wired the opposite, everything works as you would expect. the addition of the led at the end of the toggle is a great effect. since i'm using this to switch power to an amp and some circuitry, the lighted led lets me know if the unit is receiving power (and therefore, drawing on the battery).you may be able to find this item for cheaper at a parts store or other online retailers, but the convenience of free prime shipping and invoice tracking available through amazon makes this an easy purchase choice. i will definitely buy this item again when in need!

The package came on time, and was as expected. I ordered the 38-40ft and it MOSTLY fits my 39ft.There are two problems with this cover:1. Install. The directions say it is pre-rolled to move from front to back. This is important because it's very dangerous to be walking around on the roof trying to sort things out. Mine was not rolled that way. I had to throw it off the roof, unroll everything on the ground, re-roll it, and then head back up top. Once I rolled it up how it should have been, the install went much more smoothly.This is a two man job if you want to do it safely, by the way. My process took 90 mins.2. Quality. As you drape it over the rig, you're tempted to pull on the straps to tighten it, adjust it, or get the whole thing centered.  The straps are not manufactured sturdy enough to do that. So, if you're a foot off, you'll need to go back up top, walk over obstacles on the roof, and adjust it from there. Much more dangerous.To attach the straps to the tie down hooks, you have to run them through a bungie and tie a knot in the strap. No hook? No clip? That's just cheap.Instructions were lacking and didn't explain where the extra tie downs and straps were to go. I just winged it and added some of my own bungie cables to tighten everything up.Typically, Camco items are good quality. This is not one of them.

Nicely made, lightweight ramps.  Handled my KLR650 just fine.  I bought two so I could walk up one while pushing my bike up the other.  Using the included strap to secure the ramp to the bumper of your vehicle is a must as the fingers that rest on your tailgate don't attach to anything.  The ramp could slip off if not secured with the strap.  I like these ramps because there is metal across the entire surface of the ramp, as opposed to some slightly less expensive ones I've seen that have only the rods welded between the side rails.  The metal "mesh" across the surface of the ramp makes it smoother to roll a tire up the ramp.  I will say that the metal surface did bend somewhat from weight of my bike rolling up and down.  However I don't think it's a big deal.

This little parts washer is almost worthless because of the pump.  The solvent comes out way too fast and splashes everywhere.  I spent $20 modifying it by putting a flo-thru brush and a couple of brass fittings to make it work.  Solvent still sprays out everywhere. Think back on all the times you were in a restroom and turned the sink on to wash your hands and got doused with water because of the pressure.  Now imagine that instead of water it's mineral spirits running down your pants, face, the wall, and everything else within 5 feet of the parts washer. It's also very flimsey metal and I've already bent the bottom tray by putting a large part in there.  For me it was a big mistake to buy a little washer with an overpowered pump.  I was trying to save space but I should have purchased the 20 gallon unit at tractor supply. I've never owned Torin products before but I will never own another Torin product. Since I use it mostly for working on my cars and motorcycle, it's really quite worthless.

Do not buy this battery, i bought it because on the description it appears to be well made,(800amp peak, wow thats amazing) when i got the chance to test the battery for the first time it was just a bad experience. as soon as i hooked up the wire that came with it to the Eveco jump starter it popped and a cloud of smoke start coming up from the wires and the battery itself, it melt the wires and the battery connector, thus, i didn't have a chance to even connect it to the car, im wondering what would happen if i did!+ the seller didn't even respond to this matter!

Picks up signals great after install. The set screw supplied for it to adapt to the car was too short. I added a tiny bit of Loctite to the side going into the antennae then screwed it in with the right amount of threads exposed before the install.

Failed in the middle of a road trip, lost turn signals all together. complete waste of money.Update: turns out I was sent the entirely wrong product.

It works well and looks good at a fraction of the cost of the O.E.M switch. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is it does not fit as well as the original switch. However, I solved this problem easily with a bit of 3M strip caulk on the switch's backside to hold it down. Even with the extra trouble and expense, my total cost is far less than using an O.E.M. part.

Install was easy with an impact. However, use a thick long screwdriver or handle of a crescent wrench in my case to seesaw leverage the last bit up and over the bolt. I think it was purposely a bit shy going over the bolt. They fit a lot better than the other same styles generic sliders from another manufacture on my two door!

I use these for front turn signals in my Subaru with a TapTurn programmable flasher module.  After trying various LEDs that crapped out or just didn't have enough output, I've settled on these. They are EXTREMELY bright and highly visible, even in full sun.  Been running for months now and they still work fine.  I applied acrylic conformal coating to the LEDs before installing them to keep vibration and moisture from damaging the chips.

First off let me say, I have installed many running boards and this pair is by far the best I have ever done. The dimensions of Height, width and depth are absolutely 99% perfect. They are arrived fast (with prime) and were flawless. Not a single scratch or blemish. I inspect all my products before I use them. I installed these in 45 minutes then waxed them (always wax running boards after install).These were a perfect fit for my 2018 Toyota Tacoma SR5 Double Cab. Everything (mounting holes) lined up perfectly. No problems. Highly recommend.

Most of the other racks I have looked at a re not very heavy built and very plasticy. It was also easy to put together.I have a 2006 Jeep Wrangler with a Smitty Bilt bumper hitch. I have a 35" tire mounted on the tire carrier. The front bike is right up against the tire. Rack will not fold up on this setup without an extension.ProsEasy to put togetherbuilt heavy dutyholds my Stump Jumper 29ercomes with hitch lock and bike lock with matching keys. 6 keys total.Built in repair standcam system to tighten unit in hitch so it does not wobblecame with all tools to put it togetherpackaged very nicelyConsLocking cable is not long enough to fit through the wheels and the frame.Price - while expensive, you do get what you pay for on this one.

Because of the previous reviewer's bad experience, I was a little nervous using these because they are definitely a little bit different in the area of the points when compared to other pliers made for these types of CV boot bands. However, I had no trouble at all today when I used them for the first time. These pliers allowed me to effortlessly install the factory Toyota CV boot bands on a Lexus ES300 (of course, Toyota uses two totally different types of bands in their factory kits, this tool obviously only works on the ear-type).

These things are garbage, I spent time to crimp, solder, and use glue lined marine heat shrink with these connections to expensive cable for a winch and jumper cable system, 8 of these ends total, 16 connections,  only to find when I needed my winch they don't conduct power, I thought my winch was broken... because it couldn't be the new connectors I just painstakingly crafted to new wires, I was wrong. Wiggling the connections doesn't help , the contacts are not tall enough and  or the spring metal holding them up isn't powerful enough, or the plastic is exceptionally weak not allowing the contacts to be pressed together, either way they don't work, and by the time I figured this out the return period is over and hours of labor and materials have been spent.

Shades fit well and cover the majority of our class C windshield..  I like the two-piece design as it is easier to install/remove and  allows for fitting around the mirror or curtain. They are easy to use once you get the hang of bending the outer spring to make it fold up-we're hunters and do it all the time with pop-up blinds. I wish it has a bit more reflective surface on the silver side. It is silver color, but not shiny-reflective like a survival blanket, which I may attach to them to increase their heat reflectiveness. Or I may just spray them with another coat of silver paint. VERY GOOD product for the money.

Heads up, they don't do well in a focused reflectors.  Several small LEDs don't do well with focused reflectors.  Plenty bright and fit/finish seem fine.  I used them in the cabin floor pan instead.  Much whiter than most aftermarket LEDs that have a blue tint.  Color is very near to daylight.  Photo is with item on left and factory on right.  No discredit, just doesn't do well with a focused reflector.

I always double check parts before doing any job, but this bottle makes no sense: "Type B - 10WT". The sku matches up to the Maxima website for 10WT however the "B" isn't helping.  Type B is 5WT oil. I understand this to be a label typo that went into production, however how can I be certain this is 10WT? Seems this seller bought a pallet of mislabeled product on the cheap. I am very disappointed with this purchase in more ways than one. ZERO RATING.

I went with the stick on Ventshade for the Dodge Journey, because I didn't want the in channel type that I have on my other car, I just wanted the window in the channel and not the vent. The front visors work great but the rears are kind of useless . . not so much on a dry day, but I won't crack the rear windows if any chance of rain. On the Dodge Journey (same situation on my Mercury Mariner / Escape) the most rearward part of the top of the rear window angles down and rearward . . kind of reverse of the front window. When you crack the rear window the window separates from the weather striping or window channel and would allow rain to enter the car at that point. However, with the rear deflectors the car looks more complete. Just know when you order them, look at the rear windows FIRST to see if you will be happy with them.I also like the looks of the stick on type better on a black vehicle vs. any other color as the blend in vs. having the smoke color of the visor on the colored part of the paint . . . if that makes any sense to you.For some reason the picture I included rotated  . . . . the bottom of the photo is the right side.

I'll start by saying I have no connection to Genssi at all. Just looking for better lights on my 97 jeep Cherokee 4x4. These lights are awesome for the price. Great build quality, and extremely bright. Low beam pattern is very wide and actually very nice. Not very blinding to I'm coming traffic. Even though it doesn't have a sharp cut off line. It's still a nice light spray. And the middle drl looks great. Here is my biggest complaint. And I am ging to email genssi about it. I bough the lights because I love in East Texas out in the country a little bit. So I do alot of back roads driving at night. So I needed something bright with a good bright beam pattern that reached down the road good. And there's DO NOT spray light down road at all. It just makes a huge hot spot in the middle of the low beam pattern and does not project down the road. So if they could fix that. Just to, make the high beam go futher it would be a 5 star light. Yes I have adjusted the lights every which way. And still sucks. If I adjust them up to were the high beams look good I blind the crap out of on coming traffic. Because the low beams have to be wayyy up in the air. And that makes the low beams almost useless. So if they contact me back and we can fix it. I will change to 5 star. Pics of led vs stock. Then low beam and high beam. And will try to post a vid as well.

Great kit for a great price. Installed it on my suzuki m109r and it looked great. It was nice that when you turn off the remote with one color .. the same color will return when you turn it back on. It does come with to extensions but I strongly recommend you buy at least a 4 pack . I purchased a extra 8 extensions ... after I finished the install.. I only had 2 left.

So far so good, haven't got a flat yet but I will be ready.  Super easy to load into a tube tire and I can actually feel the difference with the balancing of the tire while driving at higher speeds.  Cheap insurance for that next nail that gets picked up.UPDATE:Just a few weeks after installing the ride on I noticed something shiny in my rear wheel tread, I pulled this 2 inch nail out of my tire with a pair of pliers.  The ride on sealed the puncture in my tubed tire with no issues, I am really not sure how long it was in there.  It is holding 37 lbs of pressure just fine no issues whatsoever.  This is proof that it works otherwise I would have had a flat tire!  Check your tires often, you never know what you just might find.

Got my delivery from China today. They look pretty decent, seem to be made with metal bases, have 3M adhesive backing... but they don't fit the recesses in my wheels - they're too long. Now, my wheels are BMW knock-offs, but should absolutely have the same dimensions as the OEM wheels. So whatever you're thinking of putting on, measure first before you order. They were so inexpensive that I'm not really crying over it, I just wanted future buyers to be forewarned about the size.

First off, like others said the default picture is not the right product. I've included pictures of what it will look like.The quality of the plastic is high, and the fit is pretty good. I can notice a very slight gap at the top, but its small, and there may have been a gap with the stock dash piece, I don't remember.It fits perfectly with my double din Pioneer head unit, does not get in the way of the motorized screen in any way.Installation is easy and includes everything you need in case you go single-din. It doesn't include any mounting supports for your head unit, which is good, as you don't need any. You use the factory head unit mount for your new unit, keeps it secure and sturdy compared to other dash kits I've helped install on other cars.The only downside is the trim clips. I don't know what they are actually called, but on the stock piece they are white, on this piece they are black. Seems like these black clips are slightly inferior as if you try and take off the new dash kit some of the black clips won't come off with the trim as they should and you might lose a few behind your dash as I did. I replaced some of my lost clips with the stock white clips from the old dash trim, so no biggie.Overall this looks great, fits well, and at a great price.

This is a great battery reviver!

I'll tell you why:***Wonder why this charger has bad reviews? You can't just slap it on like duct tape and expect it to work instantly. You must understand desulfation takes time and it's hard to tell if anything is good is happening if you have a battery that still works. You battery will be improved, you just have to have a good way of measuring it, or, just go ahead and trust it. I tested both units with two very abused batteries that were connected in series in a 24 volt system. They were off-brand, not charged for years, dead, and allowed to freeze over several winters. Several dumb chargers wouldn't even start charging them. Perfect candidates for worse case de-sulfation testing!Pros of both chargers:1. Charges and maintains 12-Volt flooded lead-acid and AGM batteries.2. Desulfating pulses3. Same results after 45 days of testing on two similarly dead batteries (see attached chart).4. Both chargers have wildly inaccurate percentage indicators! <b>Do not use them at all!</b>Unique to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pulsetech-Xtreme/dp/B00BPF0Y64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pulsetech Xtreme</a>:1.

Input Voltage: 100-120 VAC2. Optima wants you to select a battery type every-time you power up the charger, but if no selection is made after 10 minutes, it will automatically default to a safe charging mode.2. Poorly designed display. Looks cool but mine (as well as several other people on Amazon) have lines missing on the display so it's nearly impossible to read. When it's cold out, the LCD doesn't even work. On the plus side, you really don't need the display at all!4. Clamps are really unnecessarily plastic-y but should hold up unless you are rough with them.5. The case feels delicate. Looks cool though and great cable management. There are several reports of the case breaking open if you drop it.6. Do not use with Gel or Lithium batteries!7. The green indicators are blindingly bright. If I had to interact with this charger everyday in a shop, I wouldn't.8. 3 Year WarrantySsssooooo.... in summation, why would I recommend the Pulsetech?1. Cheaper2. Better build quality with Army-proof setup.3. Both chargers restore the battery at the same rate, i.e. same results.4. Longer WarrantyAs you can see, it will be a while before the batteries will reach their maximum potential but desulfation takes time.

I just finished the installation on a 2015 Jeep Willys (sport). First of all installing something like this you will need to have understanding of wiring and automotive knowledge.This job was the hardest I ever done in recent memory. This is an excellent kit but the Jeep has exactly zero space to put your hands, swing a wrench or to simply lift the item into position.The tank has on the bottom a screw which is the drain port. I made my life easier by adding an adapter fitting then a 6' air line which connects to the rear bumper. I then placed a drain petcock to the end of the hose so I can drain the water out of the tank after use.I installed two hot lines coming off of the battery. I didn't put anything on the original wiring because if something happens they could void the Jeep factory warranty.I have it switched under the hood and each hot line is fused. 25A and 3A respectfully. There is a relay provided and used.Some complain of the wiring is hard to understand. Yes the instructions are not the best. But re-read it a few times and it makes sense. Remember + or - on every connection.See my attached wiring schematic.Remember that the horn solenoid has 1 positive and 1 negative (the posts do not matter how they are wired).On the horn button, one side is grounded, the other side connects to the horn solenoid. (It don't matter which posts are used on either).The tank pressure switch has 1 positive and 1 negative (the posts do not matter how they are wired.)It took about 14 hours to install but I like the Kleinn slogan. TOO LOUD, TOO BAD! Yea it's worth the effort. The next texting nut in front of me will get a horn full :)

Well, Wow! What a nice surprise as to how nice this windshield works. With the stock shorty my 2015 FLHXS Street Glide Special at 80 mph I felt a fatigue producing head buffeting and problems enjoying that great Boom Box. BUT NOW with the Memphis Shades 6.5 in. Spoiler Windscreen at 80 mph and even above there is no, YES NO - head buffeting! Gr8 fitting - easy 5 minute installation - can't say enough - gr8 riding- get out there and a Ride!

This is my initial impression of the Curt Roof Rack.Pros:Build qualityLightweightMakes my fozzy look more rugged (still adding parts slowly but surely)Cons:Received with scratches (box was not damaged from shipping so therefore I presume it occurred in the production/packaging processScrew openings do not give enough space/margin, you literally may need 2 people to install the screwsMy own 2 cents on this, I did read about complaints with rusting and honestly for a 1/2 to 1/3 cost of a Yakima or Thule setup (factoring cargo net and extension) the fix/prevention to this kind of issue is a pretty quick fix.  Get black silicon and black trim spray paint, all sections where you have to conjoin the pipes and thread screws I would recommend that you apply the silicon liberally and wipe off any excess.  After the silicon cures a bit you can spray the screws and joints with the trim paint spray to get that matte finish and also to put a seal over the screws as chances are you may have removed some paint while torquing down the screws.If with this attempt my idea fails completely, I will simply dry the setup out and look at redoing it with either Plasti Dip or truck bed liner spray

Installed the light bar on my 2015 Wrangler. I read the reviews, but didn't bother with the directions I unstand people are having issues with installing the nuts. My solution was using crazy sticky dots from my wifes scrapbooking stuff and placing them on the end of a flat tip screw driver. One from the top and the other from the bottom. It took very little time. It may be frustrating for the novice shade tree mechanic.  Other than that, on my 2015 Sahara Altitude I did have to trim a few inches from the plastic filler plate between the grille and the front bumper that sits on the frame rail. It is held on by two plastic trim screws and could have easily ben received and left off, but I like that it cover the opening there. Bar is sturdy, but even torqued down can be shifted with force. It is sold as a light bar and nothing more so it is totally fine.UPDATE: After about a month I really didn't like how high the bar sat above the bumper. I removed the 4 nuts/bolts that hold it on and pushed the bar downward. I aligned the top hole on the Mopar bar with what is the bottom hole on the frame or number support and bolted it together. Now the lower hole on the Mopar light bar is too low to use, but I will drill a hole through the Mopar light bar bracket and the frame to have a second secure location.  Add pics with the lowered car (I did also swap tires...still the same Jeep.)

Have used original Por 15 and have had fantastic results so I decided to give this a shot. I've done all the prep work and applied like the instructions said. Then painted my whole exhaust. Half the exhaust closest to the engine is peeling off and the other half stayed on and looks good. Eventually it will all probably peel off. Complete waste of money and time.

This is an excellent light bar. I purchased the 20" and installed on my Warn Trans4Mer GrillGuard. Fit perfectly without having to drill. The light was securely packaged and include quality mounting hardware, but unfortunately NO INSTRUCTION. There is a chrome screw on the left, rear side of bar that appears to have a purpose but since i had no instruction, i have no clue whats it is. The only other negative is that no lens covers were included or offered as an option, as it is illegal in some states to drive on streets with lights uncovered. After spending hours researching lens covers, I found a lens cover on the web but can't post location due to Amazon rules

Installed a set on my 2017 Sportsman 850 and on my 2016 570. They work as described. They are a must if you ride in the trails and you want to keep track of your surroundings. I keep hearing people say these are cheap, but what do you expect for 35 bucks. They are all metal except for the mirror itself. They are adjustable. People are saying they keep coming loose. You have options to lock the mirror down in the position you want. I'm assuming people are not doing this and just screwing it to the handlebars and calling it a day. They work exactly as intended.

the felpro valve cover gasket is a mirror image to the oem honda one that was leaking however the spark plug tube seals are not. the oem honda tube seals have 2 small breather holes for condensation to escape, the felpro ones do not. i will sadly be reusing the original honda tube seals for fear of trapping moisture may cause problems later on.

For true plug and play bulbs (Without ballast or other cord) I am not sure you can get a whole lot better. These fit perfectly into my housing and took all of 5 minutes for both, if that. Mine function as both DRL and High Beam so it is run at different voltages and it functions just fine with no flicker! The DRL (6-9v) is plenty bright for DRL and fills the housing nicely with a bright cool white light. The High Beam (13-14v) gets the bulb even brighter but doesn't function like a true halogen bulb. The LED light scatters and isn't focused on the road but instead illuminates all reflective surfaces like my LED light bar, very bight! I knew that this would happen going in but something to note. When compared to some "60w" H7 bulbs these outperformed them with ease! Would recommend in a heartbeat!

These are some really nice LED Bulbs.  The only issue I had with them is that I ordered the H10 for the Fog Lamps on my 2005 Chevy Colorado which are supposed to be H10, but the tab pattern for the bulbs that I received were for a 9006 Bulb.  It isn't a big deal though as both patterns are almost identical other than the big tab.  The 9006 bulb will fit you just have to put the small tabs in first, leaving the big tab out of the slot, then slightly twist it clockwise then push the big tab in and continue twisting.  They are pretty bight for a LED.  I wouldn't by no means say that these are bright enough for actual head lamps, but for Fog or Aux lights, the work great.  I have driven at night down the back country roads by the house with just the Fog Lights on to see how bright they really were, and they were bright enough for me to see, but I have extremely good night vision die to my eye eye color and I worked nights for 2 years in the Marine Corps while in Iraq.  The 6000K color is a true white with a very slight blue tint.  The blue is so miniscule, that you can't even notice it when you just have the LEDs on.  You have to turn the head lights on in order to tell.  I have Philips Crystal Vision Ultras for my head lamps, which are about as close to  true white light you can get, so you can see a difference.  I will post some pictures of later to show the difference.  Overall I am extremely happy with these, and if I ever need to, I will buy these again, though I don't plan on it for some time since they are LED and should last at least 5 years.

***Update:  After having used these for nine months, I noticed the other day the vinyl covering has deteriorated, exposing the cloth backing.  They're not even going to make a year, apparently.  Being a little UV resistant would have been a nice feature!  Minus one additional star.Original review follows:My experience with tire covers in the past has been that they're typically a little undersized, and I wasn't sure which size to order with these.  My tires measured 27 inches in diameter, but I figured that these would be better off too big than too small as some previous covers had been.So I ordered the 30-32 inch covers, and they fit my 27" tire closely enough that I can't imagine them fitting a 32" tire well.  So if you're on the fence, err on the larger side.  The really nice thing about these is that they have a web strap on the back with a quick-release buckle, so there's no way they will blow off in a windstorm.Despite a scarcity of sizing information in the description, the box comes with a comprehensive list of tire sizes that you can use as a guide; I will upload it to the photos and see if it's legible.Regardless of some other reviewers commenting about the covers being too short to not protect the bottom of the tire (my pet peeve!) these are so long I actually had to turn them up to the inside.  Overall, well made and very much worth the purchase price.

The parts depicted are NOT the same as the ones I received. The head is a mock Phillips style, the body/shank is 7.92mm, not the 6.35mm as shown on this page and you'll have to break the part to remove it in the future because of the fit and style of push pin that comes with it. If you plan on keeping these wrong parts, you'll have to drill out the hole in your car to get them to work correctly.Update: seller apologizes for their mistake and only offers partial replacement costs. Wrong pictures are still listed for this part.Second update: seller refunded cost. Wrong part STILL shown on the description.

Perfect match in my 2011 GMC 1500 Sierra W/T 4x4. Instructions were not as clear as could be. Use the lowest bulb for the lowest on new assembly. Unscrew 2 screws each side on bed inside tailgate. Pull gently.  Unscrew all bulbs. Lay under truck follow light harness, unclip from block between spare and bumper. Pull out old light harness. Install new harness and plug into block. Pull out 2 on each side, plastic plug holders.  Then install new lights into plug holes.  The new lights have new keeper plugs.  Reinstall 2 screws each. Check all the lights with help. EnjoyUpdate: having trouble with driver side parking light, going to try calling customer service, hope to get an answer and not negative. Should have lasted longerUpdate: doesn't look like Spyder Auto is the company I thought they were. I went with more expensive tail lights for no reason apparently. All they are saying is contact amazon about the faulty tail light. After 2 stops and warnings, I guess I'm stuck with bad lights................

I have leather conditioner for my leather seats, but it is minimal. This is my second leather product and I am very happy with the results. I had some old boots that I never took care of and have used heavily over the years. I have a picture of them cleaned and they were in pretty sad shape. I put some of this on and it helped bring out some of the lost color. I have several leather products and some of them I plan to have around for the rest of my life, like my leather bound books. Putting on some leather moisturizing conditioner about once a year is supposed to help your leather product last significantly longer. If you have valuable leather pieces than conditioner is well worth the investment.The product is a gel and the leather seems to soak it up. I had to use a couple quarter size drops on a rag per cowboy boot and I probably could have used more. If you do a large piece like a couch I image that the bottle will get pretty low. On the second leather piece in my attached pictures shows how shiny the leather became due to absorbing the moisture. The product suggest that it will take one hour for the product to dry. The product has a slight odor but is gone within minutes after application. After the product dries, the conditioner is supposed to help against future stains, cracking, and waterproof the product. If I had used this product I would not have the water stains on my boots as seen in the picture. The price is fair for the quality you get.I am not an Amazon or company affiliate. I am an Amazon Prime customer who writes reviews as a hobby. I received this product as a promotion.

Makes the impossible Possible!!! This says it all! Spray it on the decal mounting side, spray it on the vehicle mounting surface, position decal on vehicle, spray Rapid-Tac on top of decal to lubricate for squeegee, and begin to squeegee out the air bubbles and excess Rapid-Tac from trapped between the decal and mounting surface. Do this quickly as there is about a 2 minute window before the Rapid-Tac begins to grab. Wipe surrounding overspray off using microfiber towel and wait approximately 1 hour before peeling off transfer paper at a sharp angle to the mounting surface.

The part looks great and fits as it should. Doesn't seem to create the airflow needed to keep the smallest of bugs from hitting the windshield.If you like the looks of a truck with this kind of windjammer on it, buy it!  The part fits great and will keep rocks and other garbage from hitting the hood.

Perfectly white light matches my DRLs and fogs perfectly.  I must say even though they are 65 watts I believe they are not quite as bright as my factory low beams (55 w).  I used these harnesses so I wouldn't have to alter my original wiring: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CYB90UO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  .  Quite simple with just a bit of trimming on one of the tabs on the bulbs and one of the sockets on the new harnesses. In the pic, original on the right and this H9 on the left.  2017 Tacoma TRD Sport.

Works pretty well.  I used this along with the Noico foam and it did a great job reducing sound on an old VW bus.  Very easy to install/cut and use in tight spaces.  It has minor issues with part of the backing not coming off great when you pealed the paper away which is why I gave it a 4 star but I would buy more.

Receive the item really fast UPS. Big cover went on nice and easy sticks EXCELLENT! However, the handle is not sticking properly at all. The 3M tape is not sticky. I tore of the old 3M tape and replaced it with new 3M tape. Sticks just like the other now. I only gave 4 stars because the handle was not sticky at all.

Its nice to have it on my truck but this one came in all scratched up. From the box, the bug is wrapped on plastic and no foam to keep in it place. Though I noticed in addition to the scratches that it had deformity on top left but it wasn't that bad. I was thinking of exchanging it but I didn't bother because of how it was packaged. Im on the fence on really recommending this but it is up to you if you wish to add this to your Tacoma. I wouldve given 5 stars if the guard was properly packaged and had their QC handled. Other than it should serve its purpose.

Great wheel locks. used it for my 1995 Acura Integra. The outer part of the wheel lock (the circle part) will spin freely and then you would use the lock key to tighten down the wheel locks. This prevents people from using pliers or vice grips to try and spin off the wheel locks. Get it. Sorry for the dirty wheels. it rained

I have been using this on the soft top of my Miata and looks incredible. A friend that does a lot of detailing recommended this to me as he uses it for interior detailing and the tonal cover of his truck. It is a great product that definetly works. I have been applying it every few washes and my soft top looks better then new and the car is 25 years old.

Easy install, remember to get orange bulbs to be legal, takes 2 bulbs per sideEditAfter having them for awhile, they both somehow sprung a leak and got condensation in them, bad enough I ended up pouring water out of them. I used a non hardening silicone to seal the bulbs in that way I could disassemble them when they needed new bulbs. Now I have what use to be nice clear and chrome lenses that are black and clear. Don't really match the scheme of the Jeep any longer but I can't return them because I need them to drive my Jeep. If you decide to get them I would recommend you seal the bulbs or possibly replace the sockets so it seals real good.

I bought these to replace Westin nerf bars and update the look of my 06 Dodge Ram 2500. I love them! The fit/finish was superb! While two people would make the install easier, it can be done by one. Just take your time and read the instructions!

I received these about a month ago and finally got to installing them today. I didn't even bother with the hardware that came with the guards and used the factory tail light screws over other reviewers suggestions. I had no problem with the provided spacers (about .375in long). I simply painted them with a black sharpy and the whole install took less than 5 min.  I am not sure how they will hold up in time with the salt used for the snow but they look good and for $30 I can't complain.

Great lights, easy to install. The only reason I give 3 stars, is the fact that 2 of the lights had a burnt bulb in them. Not worth returning and going through the hassle.Mounted on a Jeep Rubicon.

After purchasing numerous jobsite radios over the years and being less than satisfied with the overall sound quality and features, we decided to just build our own.  So far it is holding up well.  We mounted this to the top of our stereo project.  So far I have had this power an 18 amp hour sealed battery and a car stereo on a moderate level for 48 hours.  I left in one spot with only about a half day of sun and it ran no problem for 48 hours.

Many of you are like myself, reading reviews looking for con's on the item, is the reason why I gave this product a 3 star hopefully some of you might read it so you can learn by my ignorance.First this wiring harness works awesome on 2007 Harley Ultra Classic, does exactly what it says, low/high beams passing lamps remain on.  You can turn off lamps with your factory toggle switch also.Here is the problem I had.  The wiring connector is immediately below the radio between forks.  I had to move some wires to find it.If you have big hands, which I do, its difficult to grasp the connector and get it to release in a tight area.Mistake one,  decided to use a flat screw driver to push in on protruding nipple on connector trying to release while pulling.  WRONG - I pushed down to hard and broke the end.  All you have to do is use your thumb and push down while pulling.  I thought the nipple needed to be pushed inside the connector, it does not.  Same connector is right above the factory radio if your wanting a better view.  I'm not a mechanic and after several hours trying to get this broken piece out, using small flat screwdriver pushing down on the broken end while trying to pull in a tight area, near impossible.  My 33 yr old son came by, asked what I was doing,  getting ready to trailer this to Harley shop, said no problem dad, these connectors have been stuck together since the bike was built more than likely, so take a heat gun on low heat and warm up the plastic connector, it should come right off.  The heat causes the grease/plastic to soften.Bingo in a matter of 10 seconds of heat the connector easily came off.  Looking on Youtube there is no video on "Kuryakyn or Harley wiring 5496" to give idiots like myself a visual of not turning a 5 minute easy task into hours of misery.

I have a 2016 JKU with a 3.5in lift on 33s. I also have a 5 year old littlw boy, so having to pick him up and help him out everytime was starting to get a little frustrating.  These look absolutely amazing on my Jeep, and my 5 year old loves being able to get in and out on his own. They were easy to install, however some of the bolts were to thick to go threw some of the holes, but it really wasn't a biggie.

Super bright!!! Much brighter than stock halogen bulbs or cheapo Chinese leds. Dual LED brightness is awesome for taillights. I'm very impressed with these for the money. Only time will tell how reliable they are. Be mindful that these are longer than halogen bulbs so you will need to make sure they fit your housings.

The floor mats fit fine and look good on the 2015 Corolla LE.  Should fit any 2014-2015-2016 (11th generation) Corolla in any trim automatic or manual. Comes with front and rear. They work with the twist latches/clips on the driver side. The bottom has a texture so they won't slide around. As you can see on my pics and have heard from other reviewers there is a gap that will be a problem. Most other mats will have the same problem. Dirt and snow/water will fall onto your carpet at the left footrest in the automatics, CVTs, and manual transmissions. Other than that these are good all weather floor mats. These would fit fine in a manual, they would allow the clutch to be pressed all the way down. The driver and passenger sides fit fine but are not as long as the carpet mats. They don't extend up as far. No big deal. The rear mats fit fine. See pictures attached.These are a good product (not great) they could and should have some sort of flap that covers the footrest and flows down onto the rest of the mat. I recommend these mats. They are OEM shipped from a dealer. You can get custom mats that cover that footrest if you really want them.I think these genuine Toyota mats will be fine. Just vacuum under the mat in the gap area between the plastic left footrest and mat at regular intervals.EDIT: After 1 year of use I thought I would give an update. These mats protect the carpet like they are made to do. The ONE problem is the obvious. The gap between the edge of the mat where it comes about 3/4 inch from the footrest.I have to park on dirt unfortunately. Every time I get into my car I am very careful to not get any dirt into the car, but however careful I am my shoes always pick up small stones and dirt, grass, etc. It gets deposited right into that gap. It works it's way under the mat. If you park on concrete or pavement you will be fine but if you have to park on dirt, you will need to take the mats out once a month and vacuum under the mat and around the trunk/gas levers.dirt seems to find it's way into those areas. They would do the same with any Toyota mats. To avoid this you will need to go with a custom fit company. There are 3-4 out there. They are more costly. I have decided it's easier to vacuum once in a while. It is also good since you can get the dust and debris from the other areas in the car while you're at it. It only takes a couple of minutes and 50 cents at any car wash.I still highly recommend these mats. They look great. The have COROLLA printed on them! Take them out every 6-12 months and wash them. Maybe give them a quick spray and wipe with a rubber protectant. It makes them look new again. WAY better than carpet mats I have never tried custom made mats so I cannot compare them to these mats.

Vehicle is an 05 350Z.The item was received on time and well packaged.  The bulbs seem pretty sturdy. I installed with no problem by removing the base and attaching it first with the spring,  then inserting the bulb and fastened.  I decided to try out the blue tinted cover, if they prove too troublesome I will go to clear ones later.The throw distance is decent but not the greatest due to the 8000k cover and the horrible projectors on these models of 350z. Its nice to know its a direct plug and play without the need for a ballast as these cars have little space. The bulbs fit with the dust cover without the need of modifications. The only time you will hear the fans is if you are in front of the car with lights on and car off.  No radio static. Beware,  they do get hot.Pro: Much brighter than my halogens on low beam.Con: The base that holds the bulb in place.  Its made of plastic and not metal like regular bulbs,  they get really warm and kind of worried the heat may melt them. I will update if it does happen.So far Im liking them. For those that say the lights are too dim,  adjust them.  Mine was dim on drivers side but once adjusted it lights fine.The picture is on a hill and does it no justice,  will try to get better ones.

UPDATE 10/14/2017:  Everything's still 5X5!  No issues!UPDATE 06/24/2016:  No complaints!  Rainy night pic attached!These are exactly the deep-yellow fog light bulbs I was looking for!  They work very well in my 2014 Chevy Impala LTZ's projector fog lights.It's a fact, yellow is better in certain seeing situations.  Ever wonder why many people--myself among them--prefer yellow shooting glasses?  Ever wonder why "blue-blocker" sunglasses are "yellow"?  Ever wonder why you'd want to block the "blue wavelengths?"  Ever wonder that while spectroscopically speaking, white and black are exact opposites, "yellow and black" appear to show with greater contrast?Ever drive through a business park at night, and notice that the blue-lit signs have the least contrast?  Ever wonder why none of the big-name laser manufacturers like LaserMax, Crimson Trace, Viridian, Surefire or Streamlight make a blue targeting laser--they're always red or green.  All of this is because of the way the "human eye-brain" processes light and perceives its surroundings; it's a fact of our physiology.And its been demonstrated time and again that "yellow light" reflects less harshly off of falling rain, snow, and suspended water droplets, i.e., "fog".  In fact, falling snow seems to "literally disappear" in the flat yellow beams of my car's deep-yellow fog lights.This popular trend to "blue light" is silly.  Blue is the worst choice you could make for night illumination--at least to navigate by.  There's a reason aircraft cabin lights and astronomer's flashlights are red--because "red light" is the least damaging to our night vision.  The "warm wavelengths" work best for the way we see in the dark.  That's why our Impala has dull red interior cruising lights.I'd considered LEDs for this application, but IMO, the technology and product selection just isn't quite there yet (and I did not want electric cooling fans mounted so close to the ground, with our sloppy and long Wisconsin winters).Anyway, while I can't speak to longevity yet, these PIAA Plasma Ion Yellow fog light bulbs are ostensibly perfect for what I bought them to do.  The quality seems first-rate, and the illumination and color are excellent.RayB

Great switch love the look on my TJ I have two of them. Fits right in the factory spot without problems. comes with wiring diagram. There's a small light that comes on when the switch is in the on position. This light does not distract me at driving at night at all. Came with wiring diagram. I took one star off because it doesn't move much from on and off positions. Needs a little push to get it on so you can't easily "accidentally" turn it on.

After removing the product from the packaging, applying some lithium grease on the rails can't hurt.Remove the door panel, tape the window in the up position, use painters tape to hold the glass in the up position.Remove the two bolts far left and right of the rails that holds the glass. If they are stuck, pull the holders down some.Unplug the power to the motor.Remove the six bolts that hold the rails in and lift up slightly and turn horizontal and remove.This replacement has two bolts at the bottom attached to the rails and the they supply the nuts for them.On the rail with no motor, the second bolt from the top, the mounting section is missing, but it still functions without.You can reuse the OEM bolts or use the ones that come with the product and they already have lock thread on them.Install, snug the bolts down, plug in the power connector, using your switch again, push up the glass holders up to meet the glass, tighten those two down.Tighten the remaining bolts. When the bolt meets metal, give it another turn and a half, they can loosen over time.Put the door panel back on and you are done.Tools needed:7mm deep socket (door panel)10mm deep socket (window regulator)Ratchet with extensionFlat head screwdriver (door panel)First time install - 20 minutes maximum

I was embarrassed and quite peeved when I backed out of the garage and snagged my mirror on the garage door track. I mean I completely obliterated that mirror, with it getting wedged between the door track and door frame. I just knew it was a $300 mistake. Fortunately Amazon came through again with this TYC mirror, coming in under seventy bucks. I also found that I am in good company as I saw that there are plenty of other guys that have done the same thing.Appearance wise, this mirror is basically identical to the factory mirror. In my case the only difference is that this one isn't splattered with bugs yet. The mirror feels like very good quality and functions perfectly. The only functional difference I've noted is that the gimbal motor makes slightly more sound than the factory one, but it moves just as quickly and smoothly. Installation was a snap - it took about 20 minutes to swap it out, and that was while entertaining my 3 year old daughter who insisted on "helping".Some reviews state that it does not have the little "heated mirror" emblem. I don't know if it is a permanent change, but the mirror I received on 6/18/2016 DOES have the heat emblem, which is a nice touch. I included a picture for reference. Note that the little horizontal lines that show up on the glass are just reflections off of my damaged wall, the mirror glass itself was flawless.

They fit my 2015 - 2500 ram that came with factory steps. I was concerned if they would fit the front because of how the long the steps are but they fit just fine. I would have like them to be about 1" wider but I am sure they will work out just fine.

Awesome light bar. I'm 17 and have minimal knowledge about working on vehicles and their electronics and I was able to mount and wire this light bar to the roof of my 2001 ford ranger in about two days. I used the stock brackets and just drilled into my roof and used some liquid nails as sealer. Have not had any leaks since I put it on and its been through a number of severe storms. Lights are plenty bright and I have had zero fogging on the inside of the lens. Amazing product for the price.

I always seem to have things all over the back of my car and needed something like this to be a little less messy and organized. I like the size of this because it's big enough to put what I wanted to in it but not too big where it takes up a lot of room in my trunk area. The size is roughly 19 1/4" in length x 11 3/4" wide x 13" high. This comes completely flat and collapsed and only takes a few seconds to "put it together." It unfolds open, place the bottom piece in the bottom, attach the velcro for the divider and you're all set.There are 2 carry handles (one on each side) which makes it easy to move around if needed. The other thing I really liked about this is there are 2 pieces of velcro on the bottom of it so it grips to your rug in the trunk and won't slide around or move from where you place it. The top lid folds over nicely and attaches on the front with velcro to keep it closed. There are 2 mesh pockets on the outside (one on each side) and also a mesh pocket on the inside right compartment.This is perfect for putting your groceries in when shopping, storing your reusable grocery bags in so they are handy when going to the store, first aid kit, umbrella's, extra sunglasses, small ice scraper, gloves or whatever it is you keep in your car. I have everything in here I want plus I still have room to spare for more things. This organizer is nice because now everything is in one place and not all over the back of my car. It's nice quality and should fit in pretty much any type of vehicle.I received this product at no cost in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.

This one is for the Rubicon 10A, X, Hardrock.  Works as designed and not too hard to install just takes time.  Looks great once installed.  I have a winch on my bumper so it took twice as long since the bolts are hard to access to remove the bumper but the Blue Ox part of the install was a flash.  Hardest part was just drilling a few holes in my frame.  It's a genius design.

bought the Stanley branded version of this to charge 2 12v mobility scooter batteries. i connected the first battery and pressed the charge button and it started charging at 14-15 amps and after 6-7 hours dropped to less than 2 amps and showed 100%. i connected the second battery and pressed the charge button and when i checked it 7 hours later the amps were still at 15 and the battery was so hot i though it would explode. the entire top of the battery it rippled from heat and two of the sealed plugs on top are leaking. needless to say the battery is ruined !UPDATE : the manufacturer (Baccus Global) stepped up and paid for the ruined battery :-)

I have a set of very expensive, polished, uncoated aluminum,Work Meister S1 3 piece wheels.  After looking very closely at the label of my current wheel cleaner, I realized that it wasn't appropriate for cleaning these wheels.  Most standard cleaners are designed for wheels with some sort of protective barrier (paint or clearcoat) which help prevent corrosion due to the environment.Polished wheels are beautiful, but most don't have this protective barrier.  This means that if you use a corrosive wheel cleaner on them, they will oxidize.  This wheel cleaner is made from a more gentle, aluminum friendly compound that is safe for these types of finishes.On my Work Meisters, they do a very efficient job of cleaning without oxidizing the finish.  A couple sprays onto the wheel face, and a quick rub of the brush and I'm done.  So far I'm very happy with this product.  One tip I would give is to make sure your wheels are NOT HOT when you spray this stuff on them.  Hot wheels facilitate chemical reactions and while this is a friendly compound, spraying it on hot wheels will greatly increase the chance of wheel damage.  Make sure your wheels have cooled off after a drive before you use this on them.

love how this sunshade blends into my red car and gives it a fun look.it is slightly bigger than my windscreen, with the bottom corners folding back a bit, but holds it's position well and does a great job providing a full shade for the windscreen.I especially love the two suction cups that comes pre-attached. It just means that i only push each onto the windscreen and can leave my sunshades alone... they come off easily too, without too much effort if you pry the edge, they will pop right off making it easy to remove.The fan fold actually has THREE straps... one button clasp on each end (to stop it from fanning out) and a larger one in the middle that holds it all together.Alll in all, happy with product, would recommend for something a little different from the usual sunshade !

TRASH!!!! First you have to mount it different then said because their mounting system come loose and bores out the tail gate hole. I accepted this and used a real nut inside the tailgate so it wouldn't loosen. But in less then 2 months the shock itself blew out... Literally blew out so it does nothing now.... What a waste of time installing took over an hour and a waste of money....

Bought for 2004 F150 Heritage. The box says they are for my truck as did the Amazon part checker. I believe it is for another mirror style (image with red mirror). My truck has a mirror like the first image (all black mirror).Not even close on fit.  the adjustment knob is either about an inch too short or the spacer bar is way too thin.  do not fit any where near flush with the window.  the original mirror does not fit neatly aligned with the cut out in the towing mirrorLooks to me like CIPA designed a universal fit extended mirror, adds a mounting kit, and now it is a custom fit.Returned for refund.

I ordered these to replace the stock bulbs in my 2008 G37 Coupe and my wife's 2014 Equinox. These are by far  the brightest automotive LED bulbs I've ever used. I even went and purchased a third set to put in my mother's car because I was so impressed with them.

If you are using these with CargoSmart branded tracks, note that those track openings are 1/16" smaller than brand name e-tracks and these clips will not close. I ended up filing down each clip with a metal file and then they all worked fine. These do fit name brand e-tracks as I have a mix of each. Other than that, they are solid and well built.

This product works great as a gas tank ventilation breather on the Predator 420 sealed gas tanks when upgrading from the stock intake to a performance intake. With the performance intake you no longer have a connecting point for the evaporated gasoline fumes to be burned in the engine on next startup, so this is a cheap and easy alternative to allow the tank to breathe while keeping gunk from getting back up inside where the evap canister is.

So far so good, I really like the stance of my 2003 Grand Cherokee now!  I put these in with fresh springs and shocks (I wanted to be able to go back to stock height if I sell it) and what a difference!  Alignment is absolutely necessary ASAP.  If I was more patient I should have gotten new spring isolators as well.  My factory ones are rusted and crumbly, but the rubber wasn't too bad so I used them.  No issues and I have the QuadraDrive II (AWD) for those wondering as I was.  Instructions are clear but the install was so simple I didn't need them, I just looked them over to point out anything I may have missed.  If you can use a spring compressor you're pretty much set.  Time will tell how good this plastic is, and I will update IF I have any issues.When looking at this picture keep in mind I also put new (OE style / height) springs in at the same time.  It hasn't settled enough for me to notice but it may.

Installed for a 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix GT. The car has dual climate (perhaps they all have dual climate?) with slider controls. The actuators are identical so don't worry about mixing them up.Installation is fairly simple and straight forward. For me, only 1 wasn't working which was the passenger side. I decided to install the new one on the driver side in hopes that it lasts a long time and I don't need to replace it again since it is harder to access the driver side actuator. The driver side is accessed by removing the piece that's under the steering wheel and above the pedals. The passenger side is accessed via removing the glovebox.I have included a few pictures of my "stock" (it's an old car, not sure if "Woory" was stock) actuator. It was the style with a metal gear that's visible and plastic on the inside. As you can see in the picture that has it opened-up, the large plastic gear is broken (but the motor is still good).

Very pleased to open up the package and find not the 9,000lb WLL rated shackles but the 9,500lb rated ones!  The are the plain silver hot dip galvanized ones I ordered.  I was ready to pay a bunch more to get the ones advertised as 4 3/4T WLL, but decided 4 1/2T was plenty -- so this good deal turned into a much better one.  All smiles from this buyer!

I got this for my dog who rides in the back of my SUV when we travel.  So far it works really well.  It's very quiet which I like for our sanity and to prevent scaring our dog.  The clip, cord, and air adjustment are all great features.  The air adjustment has a blue light to it so you can see it and there is also a small blue light on it so you know it's on.  Will update review if I run into any issues.  So far, would recommend!  **UPDATE** After two car rides, this clip fan makes an irritating racket when it first starts.  It takes between 7-30 minutes for it to eventually go away.  For the cost, I would not recommend this fan at this point.  Good idea, but the product just isn't built to match.  Docking 2 stars.

After 10 years, the negative battery terminal on my 2005 Hyundai Sonata had corroded so much that it began cracking and looked like it could break apart at any time.  I ordered this DB Link BTN1 Negative Battery Terminal as a replacement.  It worked great (looks impressive, too) and allows for a tight fit on the negative post.

These tires are amazing! My car rides quieter, I can't get over how nice the ride is. Great handling!The price was unbeatable I had been waiting for the Costco sale, where they give 70$ off a set of four tires, and few installation. But when they finally had the sale, not only was their price 30$ more per tire than Amazon, completely negating the "free install"... they were sold out immediately!So with two day delivery, and a few bucks per tire for install. Hands down a solid deal!

The threaded bolt insert broke in half after 3 years regular use opening/closing the liftgate.  The Monroe liftgate shock shot up and wedged into the liftgate.  I'm just lucky that it didn't hurt my son or myself when it let go.Every Monroe shock I've ever bought has been a disappointment.  I'll just add this to the list.  This will be the absolute last Monroe part I will ever buy.

I have had a 99 F-250 7.3 since I bought it new. I read up years ago about the modification to install this in the bumper for the block heater cord. Well almost 20 years later I decided to bite the bullet and get this part. The only hard part is cutting through the bumper with a hole saw. Why did I not do this years ago?!

Just got it installed. Very happy with the size of the trunk, it looks great and I can't wait to load it up and hit the road. But there are some little things I thought others should know about.First, the lock is pretty flimsy and feels cheap. It'll keep the trunk closed, but I wouldn't trust it to keep it secure.  I might upgrade the lock at some point, though I don't know how yet.This reminds me, the mat that comes with it for the bottom is cheap foam and came stained with grease/oil. I'm going to use it as a template to cut some automotive carpet to fit instead.Third, the instructions are about as helpful as your neighbor down the street wandering by and saying "hey, have you tried this way yet?" This might have more to do with being a universal part, but they were more vague than I would have liked. I still have about two dozen washers and nuts and i have no idea what they are for- maybe for trickier installations?Lastly, because this is a universal part installation might border on a custom affair. In my case I had to drill four new holes (well, six because I screwed up) to make it fit my bike's luggage rack. This isn't my complaint, but I wish it had no holes in the bottom from the factory so that it wouldn't have so many holes in the bottom after installation. Others may not have this problem: if your bike's rack is just straight bars, you'll probably be just fine. Mine was just fussier.This shouldn't all be taken to mean I hate the trunk, its just that these are the things I wish I had been told before i bought it. I'd have still bought it, but I wanted to know what I was getting into. The rest of the trunk is so good that these little issues stick out is all.

They are really bright! I purchased them to replace my OEM Halogen bulbs in my TOYOTA Prius 2017 because the original rear signal lights were really poor. I love them! but be aware you will need the 50W - 6Ohms Resistors with these lights, to prevent the hyper flash error. They were not that difficult to install, but I do recommend to get help if this is your first time. These bulbs connector only have Green and Black cables, so basically you connect the resistor in parallel to them. Make sure it makes full contact to the cables or it won't work correctly.

So far so good. Only thing that I've noticed with this set they get very hot, compared to others!! My advice keep an eye on them.My LEDs went out so I thought I'd get a cheap set is HiDS instead of paying $100 for LEDs. Get what you pay for. I ordered the 1000k. Thought they would be a bit more blue then they actually are. So if you want more of a light blue tint get the 1200k. Easy to install. Took me about 10 mins after I took my grill off.

I initially installed JDM ASTAR Super Bright 194 168 175 2825 T10 PX Chipsets LED ("JDM Super Bright PX LEDs") in the rear assemblies. However, I stumbled across these JDM ASTAR Extremely Bright Canbus Error Free 3014 Chipsets 194 168 2825 W5W T10, Brilliant Red LED Bulbs ("JDM Brilliant Red LEDs") and elected to make a switch. Big difference in what is being illuminated in the assembly. While the JDM Super Bright PX LEDs did a nice job, the JDM Brilliant Red LEDs are more crisp and vibrant!Within 24-hrs of install, one JDM Brilliant Red LED's burned out while driving up to Vegas. I contacted JDM Astar via email and they were prompt to resolve this issue with a (warranty) replacement. As with JDM Astar's products, the folks (a special shout out to Jose) at JDM Astar are top notch.

The first thing you need to do is be realistic about these lights.  If you are expecting some insanely bright flood light power out of these tiny things, then not much out there will satisfy you.  For their size though, they are a great way to add a little extra light down a dark road or trail for a Dual Sport or Enduro style motorcycle.  Aim them where you want a little extra light in conjunction with your main headlight.  Combined into one spot they are about the same brightness as my high beam.My biggest complaint is the mounting system.  The one little tiny screw that holds the light to the mount where the bracket attaches makes for a somewhat loose feeling mount.  If you plan on actually using them off road, then it might be worth using an epoxy like JB Weld or Alumabond to connect the body to said mount for a more solid connection.  Definitely use some thread locker on that little screw otherwise.

Its cheap and gets the job done.  Although trying to install it was a mess.  Why did VW make it so difficult?Update after 1 year.  I bought the same exact Fram Air Filter 1 year after buying a previous one.  The new filter didn't fit and I had to cut off some of the orange rubber on the ends to make it fit.  I am updating this to two stars because the size of the filter changed slightly (approximately 0.1") from one year to the next. I uploaded a picture of the new and old air filters next to each other to show approximately 8,000 miles/1 year of use.

These are seriously crappy, the filter element barely reaches to the ends of the cone. HOWEVER, I purchased these with the sole intention of modifying them (to fit in the frame of a CB650C). For that, and as a temporary filter, they do just fine. Eventually though, they'll be replaced with something much nicer.

Ok here is the deal this is the only review you need, I am 5-9 230lb and with a jacket underneath it is great, I got a xL and if I had gotten a XX it would of been huge, built very well has draw string in hood and can fit the face tight,  it also has the little visior on hood that sticks out to keep rain off glasses also has draw string in side on each side to pull tigt against back, two coat pockets, zipper and button in the front, leggs long long but you can always work around that it will pertect boots frommrain while fishing, materal could be thicker but then you would loose the flexablity of it should last a good while but it would not take a lot of abuse but I have not had it that long so that may not be afair statement.The storage bag know way you are going to get that rain suit in that, find a walmart bag or something. It also has some vents in it but it is pretty much air tight so put on in rain take off soon as you can so all in all come on for 30.00 I do not think you will beat it, I am so sick of those yellow ones I just though a brand new one in junk, this does not stink like a lot I have had so there you go hope this helps

I have just applied RejeX to my paint. I'm waiting for it to cure, and then will apply a 2nd coat. I'm enclosing a picture of a new chrome piece I applied RejeX to yesterday. It's like a mirror! I should have taken a before photo to compare as the shine was already new, although it appears to be much more reflective than before. I'll be applying to other pieces so I'll be able to compare better.So far, my game plan is to apply RejeX to the paint and chrome which does not get any engine heat. For the chrome which gets engine heat , I'll apply CorrosionX. I'll await a response from CorrosionX to confirm.I'm giving 4 stars as I just applied RejeX and I'd like to have some time pass, and if all's well  I'll definitely give it 5 Stars.

WOW! What a difference.  I saw the before and after photos and expected a little bit of marketing was going on there, but take a look at my OWN before and after pics.  The unit extends a little further back than a typical bulb and I had to move a few wires around inside the headlight housing to get it to fit but it was well worth the effort and money.  I feel much, much safer riding at night AND in the rain.

No need for a lengthy review as I can only highly recommend this product.  I was contemplating making this purchase for a week or so because I didn't know if it would be worth it and it was over $100 but I am glad I purchased it and honestly should have done it sooner.  This garage mat literally transformed my one-car garage into a functional room that I plan on using as a workshop. Granted I installed some LED lighting to brighten the space up but you have no idea how much covering up a less-than-perfect garage floor with this mat can transform that space for the better.  I used to hate walking into the garage because I didn't like the way the floor looked but now it looks much nicer.  The space actually looks more inviting.The mat is easy to vacuum and it has a fairly durable backing that helps to keep it in place.  I recommend using double-sided tape for at least the corners so that when you open the garage door, the wind does not flip it up.  The mat is thin but it is definitely durable.  It ships all folded up in a box that was surprisingly more compact than I thought it would be.  When you first lay it out, it appears to have some folds or creases from the shipping but they go away after just a few days of walking on it.  It fits my needs just fine and I see no reason to spend three or four times as much for a higher quality mat.It's such a great product and well worth the money spent.  I'm very happy with it and I highly recommend it.

This thing is awesome! She's already puked twice and the weathertech catches and contains every last stinky drop. The lip around the edges hugs my interior perfectly, leaving little to no room for messes to sneak through. Thanks to Weathertech for the great product and to Wheel Counter for the quick delivery and good service!

Well I am very surprised how this went AND IT WENT GREAT !!!!! (ASIN # B00W4NPVJQ HAS THE GUITAR PICK IN IT) + (ASIN # B00L4HZHKQ this has the EMPTY KEY SHELLS)  Please see photos.  -------VERY IMPORTANT--------- Read and follow all instructions EXACTLY .... DO NOT USE A DRILL !!!!! This kit has the necassary components regarding the battery replacement. PLEASE SEE PICTURES.  In my situaton I damaged the BACK of the fob assembly while trying to take out the old screw ( the very tiny screw ) had a very tiny  amount of thread lock on it which I conclude was the primary reason the very tiny screw got striped when I tried to remove it.  In the pictures you will see a set of hemostats {those are NOT included in any of the kits I am reviewing here}  upon completion I was able to replace the BACK of the KEYFOB and now have a brand new looking back with a HEX screw and extra screws if I need to replace  the battery on my other key.  Let me emphasize this "it would have cost me over 10 X the amount to have this done at the dealer AND a lot more of me have the KEYFOB key recut".  -----  I did not need to replace the front of the KEYFOB --- only the back, so for me I did not have to consider the key being recut --- you situation may be different.  As far as I can tell the cut part of the key CANNOT be separated from its housing --- you milage may vary -- AS FOR ME I AM EXTREMLY happy with BOTH products (orders of photos will be reveresed in other review)

I got this cleaner to use in my 2001 Mercedes leather seats and door panels.Using a scochbrite sponge/scrub, I sprayed the product on the scrub and it cleaned off the debris, dirt, and possible sweat from my seats.The BEFORE AND AFTER pictures do no justice because i keep my seats well cleaned, but my towel was dirty from the invisible grime.Pros:- Comes with a soft, white microfiber towel- Works well on REAL black leather- Did not pull the color out of my seats besides the obvious dirt and grime- Cleaning action can be seen when the glossy leather becomes dry and matte to the touch- Makes my seats feel less slipperyCons:- Smells weird but hey, its a cleaner that does its job- My white microfiber towel got dirty from the buildup :)In the end, my seats felt clean and I like the matte look/texture it gave. I then followed up the cleaning with some "Meguiar's 3 in 1 Leather Cleaner, Conditioner, & Protectant"I was afraid that my seats would feel too dry but in general one must CONDITION AFTER cleaning to protect the seats.

I am 100% satisfied with my purchase of the Auxbeam 4" led spot lights. They arrived early and were well packaged. Auxbeam has a lot of positive reviews and the lights  are very affordable. I ordered the "spot" to supplement my Jeep Wranglers head lights and I am very pleased with their performance. Even though they are "off road" lights they would work great as a driving light or fog light. I have them positioned so the beams are focused just below the headlights and the passenger side light is also slightly pointed to the side of the road. It makes navigating at night much easier and oncoming traffic doesn't seem to care. In the spot beam pattern these lights are well focused and it's easy to adjust were they shines. As for quality. All parts included were well packed and finished. The power and ground leads were soldered and ready for connection. In the past three weeks here in the Northeast they have been in driving rain, 60 degree sunshine, a snow storm then a few more days of rain. The lights worked great and there  are no signs condensation or dust behind the lens.I will definitely be ordering more of Auxbeam products

Having a cutoff for any HID retrofit is necessary, and these offer that at an affordable price. Like any retrofit, one needs to take apart their headlight housing in order to install projectors, and these didn't make that any easier. Like many others have noted, the threads that hold the projectors into the housing are not the greatest and tend to get chewed up very easily. Unlike other reviewers, the shrouds came with screws but I decided to follow their recommendations and use my own hardware to mount the shrouds. Over time, the projectors would start to droop and mess with the cutoff alignment, and this goes back to the fact the threads on the projector are pretty flimsy and can easily be overtightened. After having to remove the headlights a couple of times, the drooping issue was rectified by essentially gluing a small block of steel between the bottom of the shroud and the bottom of the headlight housing. Regardless of these headaches, having a cutoff is amazing since I no longer have to worry as much about glare or blinding others on the road. Moreover, having these installed resulted in a beam of light that is spread wider and farther than without projectors. However, the cutoffs are not consistent and give off a different diffraction color after using the high beams, but this usually fixes itself after driving. It's not perfect, but does the job well.

This rugged, reflective cover is by far the best car cover I've owned. I've used car covers for years, always to protect my cars from snow and debris that falls from the annoying trees over my driveway, but I've never had a car cover that also reflects solar radiation.After putting on the cover for the first time (by the way, I use it on my Volkswagen Jetta Sportwagon, but it looks like you can get the cover for just about any type of car via the measurements guide), I waited until the afternoon to see if the cover had been reflecting the sun. On a hot sunny day when the inside of my truck had already heated up like an oven, it was cool inside my VW after being covered.So yeah: I'm sold on this car cover. It's easy to install and cinches up nicely on the bottom. You probably can't see it, but there is even a little expandable bar sewn into the cover that comes down under the hood and helps you get a good seal on the cover. The cover itself snugs on using some pull strings that are simple to tighten up. The case is also nicely sewn into the cover itself, so I added a photo of the cover wrapped up in its case.Added benefit: if you ever stop using this car cover, you can get someone who knows how to sew to make you your first space suit. :) But seriously: the stuff this cover is made out of is high tech!

I too have factory remote start but the switch must be in a different place on the '15 because I didn't have to alter anything.Installation should have been easy but the outermost two screws spun the nylon nut which came as part of the kit.  Suggest that you run the larger screws through the larger nuts a couple of times before installing them so that there isn't so much friction to cause the nuts to spin.

Installed in a fairing for my motorcycle. Allows me to keep an eye on the battery while the engine is off. Looks clean and built with quality.See bottom right of my motorcycle fairing to see install.

great weights , tried them on a pair of nail clippers first to test the tape, after a few minutes tried to pry them off with my fingers, could not get them to move, didn't wipe the clippers on purpose to see if they would stick on the metal that sets out side on my porch and finger oil and probably dust on them, they still stuck hard, will use them in the fall when I change my Harley tires, going to keep on trying them over the months setting in the weather. I see if you put them on be careful to get them right or pry them off with a tool and do it again

The screw on the stubby antenna I received needed to be filed down a bit, as it didn't screw down all the way down as the screw was too long and left a visible gap. (see the attached photo). After filing it down it now fits snug and looks great! Unfortunately you do lose some reception, I'd go as far as to guess 30-40% less than the stock antenna. But it sure looks great!

Seem to work good. Used them for turn signal/marker lights on jeep TJ with Barricade flat fenders. Had to bore out the hole in the fenders as they were a little bit oblong from the factory. My only qualm is that they are a little bit different colour than the actual turn signals (JK style) I also added.

Had been considering trying these for a while.  I wanted to convert the filament bulbs in my steering wheel buttons to LED, but the real estate was limited, so I wasn't sure about fitting an LED/resistor combo in there easily.  The SMD form factor, and the built in resistor of these was the perfect solution.  There was plenty of room to spare, and these are VERY bright!  Definitely recommended

My husband and I have a ton of electronics and gadgets that we like to take with us when on-the-go. This power inverter is the perfect little power supply because we can power just about anything from it in the car. We use it for our laptops, tablets, smartphones and digital cameras. We've been able to power and charge all of our devices without issue and at top speeds thanks to the powerful outlets and ports provided on the inverter.This is an extremely portable and versatile charger. It's about medium-sized and can fit conveniently in many different places in your car. Right now, we just have it on the floor on the passenger's side and it's not in the way at all, but my husband soon plans to mount it somewhere just to be safe.It's also very quiet. I never hear it running when I'm in the car. With all the outlets and ports on it, it's great for the entire family and will really come in handy for long trips. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine.

Stuff works really well,  I was concerned that when I taped it off it may bleed into the area I did NOT want to paint.  However, when all was finished and I took the tape off the line was perfect - no bleeding at all.  After about a week I took some rather strong detergent to my boat seat to clean the unpainted area further and just to see what would happen I also cleaned the painted area. There was no effect on the painted area at all - this stuff is pretty tough.  Would highly recommend.

##### Update 1/10/2018: #####After using this wiring harness with remote in the real world I have to downgrade my rating to one star.  This product just has too many issues.If you don't put a kill switch in the circuit it will turn on and drain your battery.  Even with a master switch to the control wire it blinks and flickers sometimes when starting the vehicle.  I'm in Alaska and it gets cold.  At about only 20 degrees F and below (even with the master switch off) it will go into strobe when I try to start my truck as the voltage drops on initial cranking which causes the truck to not start because of the extra drain when power is needed most.  This along with many other flaws simply makes this a bad choice out of the other available harnesses out there.  Just get anything else.  This is tantamount to paying for a headache.##### Original Review #####Okay.  I have a few things to say about this product.  I purchased OPT7 14 Gauge 380W 2-Way LED Light Bar Wiring Harness with Wireless Remote Switch.  The pictures are misleading because this doesn't come with a remote dash toggle switch.  There is not a stitch of copper in the wiring.  It's all aluminum.  I wouldn't trust this with more than one LED light bar but the model I got has a splitter for two.  It should be fine for two as long as its not two 50 inch bars.  Probably good for two 22 inch lights or maybe even larger.  That is not the point of my review.  I digress.I just installed this so I don't know about longevity of it yet but it works well so far.  Now I haven't had the issue of it turning itself on from RF interference and I won't because I wired it so that it won't happen.  I DO NOT suggest wiring it so that you can use the remote to turn it on with the vehicle off or without a kill switch because I understand this product to have this issue from many other reviewers.  OPT7 doesn't supply any wiring diagram or anything of help so this is the point of my review.This comes with 3 fuse taps of different sizes.  You will only need the one that fits your fuse box.  The others can be discarded.  What they don't explain is that the white wire coming from the harness connector is a control wire.  It can be used with the fuse tap or used with a toggle switch you can run to your dash (Again NOT INCLUDED with the wireless remote model as in the manufacturer's pics).  I connected mine to the fuse under my hood that goes to the bright lights.  This way RF interference won't cause it to turn on accidentally and drain the battery unless the brights are on in which case it would drain the battery anyway and you would know it from the lights being on.  And you won't need to run a toggle switch to the dash because you can control it with your high beam control thats already on your steering column.  (To use the fuse tap you simply take out the fuse to the circuit you wish to use and put it in the receptacle on the fuse tap and push the fuse tap into the fuse box where you removed the original fuse.)You can connect the white wire to the positive terminal of your battery (along with the red positive wire) if you want to risk draining your battery if this thing gets interference and turns on by itself (for the purpose of using the remote to turn on and off the lights while the vehicle is off).  It's not worth the risk, however.  Do this maybe if you live in Antarctica with no garage door openers or wireless routers around you.Ive included pics of how I used the fuse tap to control it with the high beams.  You can tap into other fuses if you wish.  It will only power up on a fuse circuit when that particular fuse gets power.  If you plugged it into your AC fuse then it would only work when you turned on your AC for example.I was also lucky enough on my 3rd Gen 4Runner to completely leave out the Y-splitter as I had just enough but barely enough length without it for only one light bar.  There's no need for extra wire length if you can manage it.Overall, its not the worst wiring harness and its not the best.  The wires should be thicker and copper.  The connectors should be better.  But it works so far.  I will update this review if I have any issues down the road.***Update***  I'm actually not sure how to rate this because it works as I intended for it to work.  I understand others frustration with lack of wiring diagrams and instructions but It works.  I think other reviewers may have thought it didn't work because of the white control wire not being hooked to anything.  Again, lack of instruction by the supplier is the fault.  So far it's actually working well.  So I'm upgrading my 3 stars to 4 and that's being very generous.  It would have been 5 if they had only included instructions for wiring.  You shouldn't have to contact them for it or do a day of Googling to find the information.

I love these floor mats they are cut perfect to contor the floor and then are tough. They use the factory pegs to lock down but also have small spikes that grip the carpet so they don't slide around unlike my last set of weather techs. If you want to keep your carpet nice for resale these are a must

It seems some folks are receiving knock-off filters that are not B&S.  That's a shame.  Amazon should be doing something about it.  Luckily, mine had the "Briggs & Stratton" stamp with the OEM part number.  An exact replacement for my original filter.  That's why the 5 stars.

This product is well worth the price, cheaper thank the GM ones, they look great, fit perfect and makes your truck pop. Took me a little over an hour to put in only because one of the clips fell into the rocker panel. That is my only issue with the westin products! They do not include ANY spare bolt, nut or clips. I had to use a normal bolt and nut for one of the clips instead. But over all it was well worth it!

Hubby was wanting some car wash sponges, so car wash sponges was what he got.The picture indicates you get 5 different colors, I received 3 different colors, so guessing the color options are a little pot luck.  I received 2 apple green, 2 bright pink and 1 yellow.  It is here nor there to me, a sponge is a sponge is a sponge.I love that these guys come individually shrink wrapped in a heavy duty vinyl bag.  There is a loop in the tops of the bags so you can hang the excess, or store them. Given that they are pancakes when they arrive, really they barely take up any room.The sponges are in what I would call a peanut shape, so you hand can fit around the middle for easy grip.  I have noticed that even since taking my pictures, I have wrung the sponge out that I wet and it has continued to grow, it is around 2 inches deep.I can not help but think these would make for great bath time fun for little ones, I did not notice any weird smells being emitted from them.These are definitely ideal multi use sponges, and while most of them will be assigned to car washing, a couple of them are going to be making an appearance around my house for odd cleaning jobs, washing walls comes to mind.These are a budget friendly option for me and could easily be cut in half  to get the most out of them without feeling like you jeaopardized their cleaning abilityI received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my review

Best wideband gauge out there! I wanted to monitor my AFRs especially when I was doing pulls for my etunes. After much research AEM is pretty much the most accurate gauge/sensor combo out there. Im a big fan of the black face with green LEDs of the x-series since it has a good balance of stealth and visibility. SMY also makes a vent gauge pod which has a clean OEM-like appearance. I highly recommend getting this gauge.

This is hands down THE best plug system available for tubeless tires, be it car or motorcycle. As you can see in the pic, I plugged an SUV sidewall, and drove it 50+ miles on a dirt washboard road with no issues. It still was holding air when we arrived at camp.My only advice is DO NOT trust the Co2. Buy a GOOD tire pump. I only use the Co2 to get the tire started, and in this case, the brand new, 2 week old Co2 tube that comes with the kit leaked like a mother. Completely useless. I emailed Stop & Go and they are sending me a new one. What could have been a disaster was averted by having a tire pump available. Always have a back up plan!!

If you buy and install, you will only have to go through the trouble of replacing them when they burn out.Both lamps failed in the same way.  Very consistent.  Sometimes only one burns out.  With these, they both burned out.I make a purchase at this dollar amount, I expect it to not fail.

The idea of the helmet is really nice. Lots of Sparkles and very pretty design. However, my helmet came with cracks and misaligned graphics. Probably if you were able to choose among several helmets you could find one that was better quality. However, if your order gets messed up and you have to fight with the seller, they're probably going to end up sending you the worst helmet possible. So I think the business model here is, we may be slow and mean, but we're low quality.I hope you get a good helmet. Mine is not, let's see if they will pay to have it returned.

I couldn't find the instructions in the box for this but I grabbed them from the internet. They say to its a good idea to attach the side pieces before you put the bumper on but never really go into detail as to why. You will want to do this because the mounts for the bumper to the JEEP are right next to two of the three bolts that you need to tighten to put the side pieces on. With it already mounted they are very difficult to get to. That was my only complaint at this point. The D-Rings are very heavy duty, the bolts all went in without any misalignment issues. The whole thing was really well designed. Even the fog light mounting hardware was better than OEM (bolts and washers rather than screws).

It's pretty sturdy, however I wouldn't buy it unless you're planning on painting it yourself.I don't think I've ever bought something like this that was painted so thin, and it's soft paint at that. It will chip the instant something so much as bumps it that isn't made out of a pillow. And the clips that hold it in place wouldn't go through the stock grille as claimed, I had to put the bolt through then get the clip started from the back, I suspect that's simply because the bolts themselves were too short though. You can still see the stock insert behind it but that's with any bolt over insert, you don't really notice it unless you're right up against the truck though.If you give it a solid layer of paint or any type of protective coating to keep it from chipping it does actually look really nice, in my opinion. The fitment was perfect.

Not loud at all, i had a single exit super 10 muffler and i always wanted to put somw dual exit on my rear end. I finally decided to get the dual exit with an economic dual cherrybomb muffler. I was expecting a louder or atleast the same sound. It was quieter than the super 10. I just didn't want to spend more money to get a dual super 10. I cant return it because it was soldered so i guess i have to stick with it

UPDATE: Initially started off well but the bulbs heat up too much and damaged themselves to a point where they would flicker as soon as they are powered. Not reliable.Very Satisfied with the bulb. Brighter than OE halogen bulbs and not as hot. The heat sink works well. 1 mm longer than OE bulbs at 30 mm, so the mounting tabs will have to be bent a bit using finger. I have bought 4 so far and not one failure.

fitted onto Mercedes R500, works well but not as bright as i thought. Definately works as they should for DRL's, will posted longevity updates.fixture was easy, just a matter of placement and drilling holes in desired locations... then wiring to an auto drl switch which turns then on when car is started and auto off after engine is turned off (about 10 secs)...Update - So ... I decided that these DRL's were too blueish (did not match the LED T10's or the 5k HID's I already have...) so went to a new DRL...However, did reuse these on my daughters 'Toyota' so she's over the moon that 'her' car can now see in the dark (and lets face it, be seen at night or day!~)

I purchased this for the above referenced vehicle and it was the size I needed and fit like it should.  Easy on and easy off.  (ish) lol.  Lexus engines are cramped and the RX engines are even more so.  But... with mine, I found I was able to get it off with my bare hands coupled with a rag for grip on the slick surface (oil leak from my valve cover gaskets).  I took it out from the top.  I tried from the bottom as well with an oil wrench and the space is just too tiny for a belt wrench.  Not enough movement.Anyway ... that is my story.  I have never changed my oil before, I am a 43 year old female and this is my first time.  Changed my transmission fluid a handful of times, which is harder so I figured, why not try this?  Why didn't anyone teach me how to do this years and years ago?  I am going to teach my 21 year old daughter on her ES300.  It is a 20 minute job at best and I pay $65 at the local oil place for Pennzoil Full Synthetic Oil Change.  This cost me less then $25.  Deal.Does what it says it will do.

I originally bought this for my 2005 KLR650 but never got around to modifying the straps and putting it on. I traded the bike in for a 2014 V-Strom DL650 and when I remembered I had this pad in the back of the closet, I decided I'd try it on the new bike. It fits fairly well without any modifications to the straps. Installation was easy, although I fiddled with its placement for about 10 minutes until I had it just where I liked it. It looks pretty good on the bike, although it's a few inches short of covering the whole seat. For the most part, the passenger area is covered, but the cushion is really for me so it's not really a concern. The cushion is pretty stiff, but adds a little height and width to seat while its padded sections provide some extra comfort on long rides. I also like that it protects my stock seat from scuffs and sun damage. Not a bad purchase for $20.

I purchased a 200W light bar, and although it works it got condensation in it overnight on it's first trip to the dry desert. It hasn't dried out, and is going to cause issue once it deteriorates the copper/solder joints inside the light. I can't beat $70, but I hope it lasts for more then a year or so. I'd NOT recommend this light, unless you are willing to throw it away once it quits working.

UPDATE 2! Reordered after a smooth return of the bad bulbs..  waited a weeks to reorder them and the next set both work fine. My friend now has led in his camper and is as happy as I am with them.  The first ones I ordered are a year old now with only light use (not much camping last year, sadly) both of the bulbs from the first order are working 100%UPDATE: Ordered a 2nd set of bulbs for a friend's camper. One bulb was 50% DOA the other worked fine.  Amazon was good about return and refund. Question is do I get another set or different brand?? Changes from old 5 star to current 4 srar rating.So I got them yesterday and put them in first thing after poping up the camper and I must say they work as expected (don't forget they have a proper way so if you plug in and it's dead flip it around their +/- sensitive unlike regular bulbs). They are about 95% as bright as the 921 bulbs I replaced. The light is also more even and I think is better distribution of light.  The loss is a bit straight down intensityGood on power. (Someone else reviewed and figured out the watts for this led, thanks. Any how the 921 is an 18 watt bulb so I could run 7 LEDs and be using slightly less power (7.8 leds=18 watt).  Time will tell if they hold up have read other led bulb reviews and people say they have dead diodes (hoping this is not the case here)Fit- they fit with plenty of room in my camper light housings. see my pictures the one was just after we were getting moved in, it was dark outside so this is what my 2 lights with the LEDs do for my 11 foot box  popup.  It looks bright cause it is the picture does not quite do it justice.Bottom line, you should buy these bulbs if you are looking to save power in your camper or looking for a bit nicer whiter light.

They work very well and look almost white. I put them into the projector headlamps of my 2013 Toyota Camry and the visibility is excellent!NOTE: These are not white, very close to it though and that's fine if you don't want an actually white light. I put them in as low beams. The picture shows how they compare to the OEM fog light bulbs.

I originally bought Walker clamp part #36402 based on information available on the Walker web site.  Unfortunately, as others have also discovered, that clamp is the wrong size for a first generation Toyota Tundra such as my 2003.  Next, I bought this Bosal 255-1007 clamp based on information I found here on Amazon.  When tightened, this clamp gets snug onto the connection between Walker part #47774 and #50472 but does not get truly tight enough to be effective.  I saw in another review somebody had a similar problem so they used a shim but I did not have anything available to do that.  Instead, I went to my local hardware store and got an ordinary U bolt style muffler clamp (see attached picture) for $1.49.  It works great and was dirt cheap.

I use this product exclusively on any dark colored vehicle that I have worked on (it is also GREAT on any other color as well).  It is extremely easy to apply and just as easy to remove and it looks AMAZING!  I typically apply Black Light to the entire car, let it cure for 15 minutes to 1 hour (sometimes more, sometimes less) while I shine the tires and finish up some other odds and ends, then remove the Black Light.  I then wipe the entire car with Chemical Guys Hybrid V7 spray sealant.  The Black Light + V7 combo is a well known process in the detailing world and is hard to beat!  You will love this stuff, and it smells great too!

This item fits very well providing you have the basic tools and just a little bit of know how!1. if you have a hatchback with bumper support AND additional brace - know this the brace has to come out or the hitch doesn't go IN (it will not fit back in once the hitch in installed - but the hitch is much more rigid you so you won't need that brace)2. in order to remove the "spring" brace mentioned you will actually remove all 6 hex bolts (3 on each side) and then reinstall them. (gear wrench or flex ratchet is very useful here)installation is 30 - 60 minutes - and the product looks very good once done.Look at the photos for after install Aesthetics (yes you can barely see the square - I like it that way)- and the brace that will come out

I own a heavy equipment business and used DOT tape on everything that we own. This being said this role of Duty tape would not to stick to any of the trucks or trailers even after cleaning with acetone and cleaning with rubbing alcohol as well as soap and water. Even resorted to taking the role along with an equipment trailer to a professional vinyl shop of which even they were unable to get it to stick. Very unsatisfied highly recommend not buying this product.

Great Rotors for the price. They appear to be pretty close to OEM thickness (interior and venting) visually. I have about 2000 miles on these rotors with new pads (Bosch BC1539), and have no complaints - noise or pulsation.The coating on the rotor is very nice and even. FYI... you apply your pads directly to the coating and it wears off with use. You will probably have noise for the first several miles (2-3) until the pads get burnished in. So, don't assume defective unless you have multiple miles on them.Remember to torque your wheel to manufacturers specs; improper torqued wheels are the leading cause of premature brake rotor pulsation & wear.Installed on a 2012 Impreza and will probably order them next time I need rotors.

Fits my 05 tl no problem, replace one at a time and don't completely pop off clip on either end when removing old ones, new ones just push carefully, no tool required for install. They come in a giant box for absolutely no reason too.

The lights work great.  Simple to wire and very versatile.  I used them as running board lights on F-250.  The only thing not great about them is the adhesive but it held good enough until I could get some silicone on them.  Ran the truck in a heavy rain storm and at highway speeds with no issues.

The gloss finish of this vinyl give this a more realistic look than some of the matte films I've seen. From a far distance it looks good... until you get close enough to actually see it. That is about it for the positive points.This vinyl is THICK and quite a bit harder to stretch over curved surfaces than films I've tried in the past. After wasting a good 25% of what I ordered trying to get this stuff installed halfway decent, I finally broke out an industrial strength Milwaukee heat gun and had some success wit curves. The trick seems to be heating this film just a wee bit shy of its actual melting point for the curved parts. I covered some of the wood trim in my Volvo's interior. I wasn't super pleased with it, but it looked good enough for the untrained eye & I called it "good enough".To my great disappointment, the edges of the film had all lifted in less than 48 hours and now my XC90 looks like garbage. It looks like I tried to cover things with cheap contact paper or something. It all has to be taken apart again & removed ASAP

I bought this to retrofit an old CJ3A jeep body that has a CJ3B engine in it.  Problem was that the engine sits too high in the engine well to fit an air cleaner on the carburetor.  So I built a carburetor intake plenum (about 7/8" high) and mounted this air cleaner pointing down instead of up.  Seems to work perfectly.  I built the plenum out of sheet metal, but probably could have fabbed it out plastic.  Anyhow, this is a review of the cleaner, not my problem and its installation flexibility is great.  I spoke to K&N before picking this cleaner and they confirmed it would support the CFM requirements for the CJ3B engine.  I know, my welding skills leave a lot to be desired.

FAKE! Not a Daystar switch.  I received in a generic bag with what appeared to be a home made label.  The actual switch has 4 terminals unlike other "Daystar" switches have only 3.  Upon looking at the switch itself, it has a molded name of SOKEN RK1-06 and is a 16A 250VAC switch which does not match the description.  Buyer beware.  Bought a local Daystar switch and actually does show 20a 12v and has three prongs.  It's also slightly more narrow and and has a completely different type mount lock.

I have epoxy on my garage floor and even though it can be slippery when wet, this soft rubber mat does not move. I put this where it needed to be and marked the edge with some masking tape so I could see if it moved.  After 2 weeks it has not moved at all.  Being able to precisely park just inside the door, is like gaining extra garage space. It is easier to feel when under the driver's side tire and the bump in the front is great to know that you are just about to the stop.  It should be noted that it is NOT solid rubber.  The bumpers are hollow.  It's too soon to tell how this will hold up over the long term, but at this price I will just replace it if it does eventually fail.

If these are the right part for a 2005 tahoe, I'd hate to see the wrong part.  Moog failed to measure the brackets.  It was off by more than 1/4 to 1/2 inch.  I had to modify the brackets on my tahoe and it took over 2 hrs to install on each side.  The OEM failed after 12 yrs and 180k miles, I should have gone back with OEM.  I don't know if I trust these after bending brackets to get them in.  Plus there is No grease port.  Is that intentional?  Every other upper arm has a grease port. RK80826 has the correct bends.  You can see in pictures the bend are incorrect.

I really like the Cape Cod polishing cloths . I use them exclusively for polishing my Stainless Steel Huawei Smartwatch for removing fine hair scratches and swirls . I have been very impressed with the results , the cloths have done a very good job of covering my minor imperfections for a near perfect mirror finish under normal lighting . If you do see them under the strong light you will notice fine unidirectional micro scratches - Which are visible only if you look hard enough. Its a better finish than what I've achieved with any other cloth/polish combo I've used. See the reference pictures I've attached.Pros- Achieves a very good almost mirror like finish on Polished stainless steel under normal lighting , much better than other products I've used- The polishing cloth is of nice soft material , won't scratch your objects unnecessarily while polishing- Resealable pouch ensures that the cloths don't dryCons- Since the entire piece of cloth is covered in polish , it becomes very messy using them . You WILL get the polish on  surfaces you don't want to and hands will get covered in polishOverall I am very happy with the finish I get using them for my Smartwatch and can definitely recommend it for taking care of you Stainless Steel finishes

Towing our new Microlite travel trailer with out 2015 Dodge Durango, the visibility from the mirrors just didn't cut it. You could see just far enough to change lanes, but couldn't see anything at all behind the trailer or much of what was coming your way in adjacent lanes.  After perusing many online reviews, we went with these mirrors.  Assembly was pretty straightforward, and they attached without difficulty to the housing of our mirrors.  They held securely in place through our first long trip of over 2500 miles, and were easy to remove when stopped so they wouldn't get stolen.  I'm enormously pleased with the increased field of view - not only can I see down the sides of the trailer, but I can actually see some behind it, as well.  I feel much safer on the road.  As other reviewers have noted, there is some vibration when you reach full speed, but I think that's pretty much unavoidable with this type of product.  It wasn't excessive, and the improved visibility was well worth it.  Note in the photo the difference between seeing that there is a truck right on the back edge of the trailer in the lane next to me, versus seeing the truck and the string of traffic behind him, and the 18 wheeler behind me in my lane.

This product arrived sooner than later but was a huge disappointment. The product arrived in pieces and when snapped back together it won't hold a pair of sunglasses unless a roll of duct tape was provided. It literally flops open with no spring to it. Save your money on this one folks and look to the more expensive ones for any kind of value!!

Ordered from Amazon LLC. Page informed me this would fit my mom's 2000 Toyota Camry. It probably would have, if I'd received the proper thermostat! You'll likely be taking a chance when ordering this item.What I actually got is nothing like the picture or the one pulled from the car (old one pictured below at right). The one I received was larger in diameter so it won't fit the car, and similar to Tahoe Jones's review, there is a barcode sticker over the "Toyota Genuine Parts" box which obstructs the actual part number.

This is a Great mat set. Delivery was faster than expected.  You will pay 80+ dollars at any store for this quality. The mats are not super rigid, very flexible and almost soft but durable. I have no doubt that these will last me at least a couple years. Trimming was very easy, I recommend kitchen scissors. They cut with ease. The mats are more than large enough to fit in any vehicle. My original mats were considerably smaller but the new ones still look good. I put them in my Jeep. The only thing I would change is color. I like the look of the black, but as with anything black, dust and footprints are very noticeable. The odor was very low. Just smells like new shoes. As described these have a rugged look. The nubbys on the back provide enough traction. If you are considering this purchase , do it. For the money, you won't be disappointed.

Installed on my Ram 1500 for extra fog lights.  Easy install, pattern is perfect, almost like driving with OEM low beams.  Switch that comes with it is crap, I didn't even bother trying to use it.  I also switched out the bulbs recently to the 36 LED (red) and they produce a little bit of light.  Would definitely recommend, probably going to buy 2 more pairs for another vehicle.

You get what you pay for. Bought this for my 03 Wrangler. This light is good. It works and makes a difference on the trail for sure. That being said I was kinda underwhelmed by its performace. But for the price I wasn't expecting much. Also around 60mph this thing starts to whistle. Combine that with a strong wind and it goes off like crazy. My advice would be save up for a more high powered light. But this one works if your on a budget.

This thing works so well I gave it 5 stars despite the leaky quick-disconnect fitting everyone complains about. I had to pump up over 4 feet to get it into my basement window. It did have an equivalent drop to meet the sewer line inside the basement so there was probably some siphon action (see the pic - the yellow line I drew is how the pipe ran). I used 1" sprinkler system line because it's flexible and adapted it to the PVC fittings both in my house and at the Sewer Solution. The rinse feature is great, too. It took a long time for my black tank to finally come clean - just a regular gravity dump leaves A LOT behind.

Installed this in my 2008 silverado that started having transmission overheating issues. Was around 212-220 on a hot day. After installing, I average 165 or so while driving in town. A pretty impressive improvement. Would recommend to anyone with a truck and who pulls even occasionally. I also purchased extra hose like others have said. You WiLL need it. I used the Hayden 397 adapter to tap into my radiator without having to modify my stock lines. Great product.

Installed on a 1992 Suburban. This was a good buy. While reviews might say it is cheap or flimsy, it is not. If you mount it properly by drilling holes in and attaching it with nuts and bolts rather than screws, it will be very sturdy. I don't notice any shake or rattle when I am driving. I mounted it to the existing plate holder just drilled through. Mounted 2 Hella lights on it and it looks and fits perfect. It's pretty lightweight so it offers no protection as a push bar would, it's simply a light mount. Knowing that, 5 stars.UPDATE: If I could give more than 5 stars I would. Got into a minor crash when a vehicle backed into me and hit the bull bar. It wasn't even bent or mangled, other than a scratch in the paint it was fine. The other car's trunk was smashed in. So if there is any though that it's flimsy I can tell you it is not.

Pretty good product, it has a cult following out there.  I will see how durable it is once exposed to Chicago winter and road salt.The bottle is not too good and the cap doesn't tighten down without jumping thread and being loose.Goes on very thin and isn't too hard to buff off once dry.  Make sure to set bottle in sun to heat up a little bit before shaking to dilute any clumps.I used it on my large truck due to feedback from others.If it doesn't last I will post back up on here and switch to synthetic sealant but from info I have seen it will be fine.Has a great shine.11/30/2016 Update:  Great wax for the price.  Even manages to put a reflective shine on my white f150 on the attached photo.  That picture was though a store window as well!  If you are on the fence, buy it, you won't be disappointed.  Water keeps beading many months after applying.

Bought CG leather cleaner and conditioner after trying out inner clean and I am pretty happy with results.Bought a new GTI and wanted to protect the leather seats so I didn't need to use a cleaner as the seats were not dirty, so I just used the conditioner.A little goes a long way. I used CG CG microfiber applicators to apply leather conditioner onto the seats and leather trim on doors and steering wheel. After applying i waited 1-2 minutes for conditioner to absorb and the buffed surfaces gently with a microfiber towel, results are not drastic but it is cleat that leather is "nourished" better and does not look dry, but not greasy either. It is actually dry to the touch.It does seems that seats are just a little slippery immediately after applying conditioner, but will check back in the morning and see if, it's any better.

Great product!Just give youself time to do it properly. I went through 2 cans of brake cleaner. Go buy yourself a wire brush set (the size like a toothbrush). Also get yourself some detail painting brushes. You may need a very small size for tight areas. Mask off your rotors well and then be prepared to spend 20 minutes per caliper for the 1st coat. The subsequent coats go quicker. You will need some good lighting too. I did about 4 coats before the paint began getting too tacky to apply more. There is more than enough paint for probably 6 coats. The finish is high gloss and looks OEM.

Excellent product, I was able to install by myself in about 45 minutes with a single socket wrench and open ended wrench.  The canvas material seems very durable.  It rained about 2 days after install, I did get a very small amount of water in at the cab end of the bed, but it seems this is because of my drop in bed liner (I can see light through two small gaps where the bedliner goes over the front bulkhead rail).  I'm going to be swapping it for a bedrug soon so I expect after that the problem will be resolved.  The canvas tension was great right out of the box, it's been about a week and I just made an adjustment to make it tighter now that I have driven around for about a week and it's settled in, I like the look of this better than the shiny vinyl covers. The canvas matches the factory bedrail caps perfectly, and the material does not seem to flap around as much as the vinyl covers that I have seen going down the road.

Super easy install! Much lighter than old one it replaced (from 2005) Works great with new Winegard Sensor pro I also installed. Getting 40 Channels here in Weymouth Ma. Really depends on your location and if there are lots of trees or obstructions also so keep that in mind.Update!! After going through the mess of coax cables behind my tv and where my Harman Kardon AVR is (we used to have direct TV) I removed a 1ghz splitter that the Antenna cable was connected to (the other coax cable was going no where!) and also a old 1ghz F type female to female coax extender (picked up a 3ghz F Type because I needed it) . Took all that stuff out of the loop and now am getting 50 channels!!  I also replaced the coax from the antenna going into my rig. First thing you should do is go inside your rig and go to the Antenna riser. Get a small allen wrench and take off the handle (hold the handle because the spring will come shooting out) then the "tube  part" will easily slide out and you will see a hole. My coax was rite there. Got a metal close hanger and straightened out the hook part and made smaller hook and just pulled the coax down and saw where the outside coax went was connected to my inside coax with a f type adapter. Now the outside coax was just RG59 and beat up! It was only about a 7 ft piece due to it just went straight down from the antenna. I replaced it with RG6 and a 3ghz f type connector. If your antenna rise handle and rotator is right under your antenna you might be as lucky as me to replace the old beat up coax for your roof antenna. I also wrapped self sealing silicon tape&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Emergency-Repair-Tape-Self-Fusing-Silicone-Tape-12-x-1-34/dp/B00KBSWRDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Emergency Repair Tape, Self-Fusing Silicone Tape, 12' x 1"</a>&nbsp;to the outside connection and the connection from outside to the inside 3ghz f type connector.Update #2,  Well lost a bunch of channels since all the foliage grew in on the tree's. Went down to 25 channels. Ended up purchasing The Marathon Antenna by Free TV. Yes big price difference but let me tell you i'm now pulling in 54 Channels and we are surrounded by tree's staying in a state forest.  The Sensor lV is ok if you don't have much around you. so I knocked it down a few stars to a "OK" rating.

Decided to to load test and see how many amps the light actually draws and it pulled rounded up 2.1 amps. 2.1 amps multiplied by 12.5 volts gets you around 26watts of actual power so the 120watt claim by the manufacturer should technically draw around 10amps and not 2.1.Returning my light and trying to find a different vendor for the project since it wasn't as bright as expected.

Easy to assemble (although I wish they had torque recommendations for the bolts). I did a trial run taking my bike around town doing errands and it felt secure. I also added more reflective tape and some trailer lights.

hadn't installed them yet the weather been cold. they definitely have a good quailty feeling to them. they are also covered in a soft material on the side where the brake pads slide on and coated in what i think is anti-rust coationg.

Surprisingly good.First to address some of the questions/concerns. The glass is slightly convex (wide view). You can turn the mirror horizontal or vertical (it's very hard to turn though).The attaching mechanism is really good and very easy once you figure it out.I am using it on a 2013 Tundra and the mirrors are slightly tapered being narrower on the outside. I was worried it would slid off, but I have had no problems. Also the mirror doesn't vibrate at all. For the cost I'm amazingly surprised!6 month update: I have used it many times and I really like it. Easy to install and remove and it helps see down the side of the trailer and a bit behind. I got a second one for the passenger side and it works just as well. That said, I don't find the passenger mirror helps all that much. I can see a bit more with it, but not nearly as much as the driver's side. So bottom line, great mirror, a second one only makes it a bit better than the first and may not be worth the extra cost unless you have very small side mirrors.

Nice tires and rims. My hubcaps fit like a glove.My golf cart is a 2001 Club Car, and I have newer model hubcaps (2008?)My old OEM "Links" (4 ply) lasted 10 years...lets see how long these last (also 4 ply).

I love my new wheel covers!Just as described they do have the logo in the center. They were packaged well and arrived without any scratches or blemishes and are nice and glossy. They really make the car looked a lot nicer when it's all cleaned up.Tip: be careful not to hit the covers with your lug wrench when installing these. Sadly I put a scratch on one while tightening the lug nuts.

I previously wrote a review but I had to change it. DO NOT buy this. They only give you about 30 days to return or exchange this item. At your local auto parts it should have a 1 year warranty. I had this part for exactly 4 months to the day. The side blew out and left me stranded on the street.

I replaced both intake and exhaust on a 2009 cobalt with the infamous p0013-p0014. (Picture is the new intake, old exhaust) I did as others advised and used the oem bolt from the old part (oem bolt is 10mm, dorman bolt is 8mm). Easy as pie, the hardest part was getting the old one out, it was stuck pretty well after 8 years and 75k miles.

The radiator cooling fan in my car is 2 inches away from the catalytic converter on the engine. I used this material as a heat shield on the back of the fan motor. It does get warm under operation but blocks all infra red radiation like a champ and should let the motor live a normal life. The adhesive is extra sticky. No problem sticking to plastic and stays put. I cut it with a standard pair of scissors. Top notch material.

The long prong is the positive and once you figure out which is the positive on the circuit board they are good to go.  They look great and are a little brighter then I expected.  The bright and low spots aren't too bad, just make sure when you solder or have them soldered in place that you place them as low to the board as possible so you do get dark spots.  BTW they dim just like the OEM bulbs with no flickering at all.  However red needles will not light up well with these dark blue lights.

This is a pretty decent helmet for the money, but after wearing it a few times, I've come to the conclusion that it's designed for people with round heads. My head shape is more of a "long oval" type and this helmet puts too much pressure on the front and rear of my head. Wearing the helmet for an extended period causes it to dig into my forehead and become very uncomfortable.My head measures in at 23", which puts me at a medium on the AFX sizing chart. I also tried a large and had the same problem with it feeling tight on the front and rear of my head, but had too little padding on the sides.I wish I could make this helmet work since I really like the styling and price. The ratchet strap is great and I'd like to see it become more common.I found that the Gmax dual sport helmet fits my head type much better.Pros:-Sleek and stylish-Ratchet Strap is much quicker than a traditional d-ring setup-Good venting and airflow-Easy to remove lining for washingCons:-Shield has very mild distortion.-Shield doesn't open far enough at full open position (remains within vision)-Doesn't have quite as much padding as other helmets I've tried

Tires are decent. Quiet and grip well. Haven't driven in snow yet. Nothing better to say other than that.UPDATE: I've had these tires on my car for 7 1/2 months/6000 miles already. My car came with a bent rim up front and long story short I installed these tires on a set of brand new rims right after I purchased the car.I thought there was something wrong with the front end because it would always vibrate my steering wheel at 65+MPH. So $2000 later in pretty much rebuilding my WHOLE front end, turns out it was the d*mn f-ing tires the whole time!!!These tires have excessive runout I guess. Either that or they have some serious QC issues and there is internal tread separation(I don't see any abnormal wear). I did not buy these tires off Amazon hence it doesn't say "verified purchase", found them cheaper off another site.Point is, for a beater car or just to get around town these are perfectly fine tires. If you do any, even the slightest bit of highway driving DO NOT MESS WITH THESE TIRES!So pissed I could have saved $2000 and just gotten a set of Nittos or Goodyears for $150 more.

Awesome product! I have tested it in battlefield conditions (if battlefield conditions are the idiot drivers here in NC). I installed this bumper with the Smittybuilt winch about three weeks ago. Added some extra LEDs upside down to the upper mounts and it looks fantastic. How does it hold up? Well, some kid stuck his nose out in my lane about 10 feet in front of me and I was standing on the brakes and whacked him good. I was actually pushing so hard on the brake pedal with both feet that one of my rusty brake lines ruptured! Damage to my vehicle: Bumper was slightly bent inward and the LED bezel was cracked (but the light still worked), needed a new brake line. His damage: needs a new wheel, fender, hood, headlight, front cap and radiator and that's what we could see, probably more damage underneath. Tough bumper! I am impressed.

I personally hate washing my truck. Especially hand washing it. But I watched some videos on the tube, and ordered a full line of Griots products.To start, this stuff smells fantastic! Most soaps just smell like soap. You need very very little to get a ton of bubbles to wash your vehicle.Lubrication with this soap is like nothing I have ever used before! I have always just used some soap from one of the big box stores. This stuff is just amazing and you can feel the difference while hand washing your vehicle. I did use the speed shine and sunthetic clay prior to washing and I believe that made a huge difference. I will never buy a different soap for hand washing my truck again. If you are even remotely skeptical about buying this, don't be! Just buy it!

Fits like a glove on the 2016 Sierra Denali.  Front ones attach using three existing factory screws and provided bit - you just need a 1/4" ratchet.  The rear ones are secured by two cam locks and a plastic lip, and they provide the allen wrench, too.Note - to get the rear fenders on easily, unscrew the cams almost all the way and put them in the unlocked position, mount to the fender, and you can then hand-turn the cams to the locked position before tightening the screws.  You will feel some resistance, which is good.  The instructions tell you just to start screwing, but this doesn't ensure the cam falls completely into the locked position.

It's okay...quality is great, but sizing is not exact. I assumed that considering the advertised it on a jeep that it should fit a Jeep's standard tire. It does leave a bit of a gap. I am not exactly sure how to go about measuring the tire...but across the tire is 32.5...maybe 33". I wish the cover was a little bigger, but I do love the quality of the graphic and the overall tire cover.

Inexpensive way of letting other drivers know you're pressing your brakes. Easy install although it didn't come with instructions. Red wire to brake light (green in '06 honda cbr600rr) and black to ground (find a metal screw to body/frame) end product would be when you press on your brake(s), the strobe would light indicating you're slowing down/stopped to other drivers aka 'flashing your brakes'.

Make sure you place the decal wet otherwise you won't be happy. Mine came with the mini kit of spray and plastic card to smooth out the bubbles.

I have an SUV so my "trunk" space isn't the greatest and my husband often has tools in the trunk, so I was pretty excited to get this to try and organize the limited space I do have. My absolutely favorite feature of this organizer is that you can adjust the size.  I currently have mine set up for half the size it can be, as that is all I have room for.  If I wasn't able to adjust the size this would be a great, but useless product for me. It's super easy to set up and figure out and how to adjust the sizes.  Even the separators in the compartments are move-able so you can really customize this to suit your needs.I frequently shop at a grocery store in which you have to bring or buy your own bags, and I often forget the bags, this new organizer serves a two fold purpose for me.  I can not only store my re-usable bags in this organizer so I don't forget them, but if I do forget them I can use this to hold my groceries and not get stuck paying for grocery bags!  I've found cans of soup from grocery trips under car seats weeks later because items roll all over the car, and now I don't have to worry about that.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

Ive never had a hitch mount cargo rack, so I cant make any comparisons, but this thing is good enough for what inplan to use it for. I can still open the tailgate of my jeep when its not loaded, so I definately like that. I recommend getting a hitch tightener to cut down the wobble and rattling that is otherwise inevitable. Goes together pretty easy, and the brand stickers come right off, so theres another bonus. The only thing that i would improve is the material used on as the base feels somewhat flimsy and there aren't any gaps to run the lighting wires through. Just snip out a small gap and you are good to go. Strong enough for my behemouth of an icechest and some other odds and ends. It could use a guard for the light plugs of some sort. They can easily be snapped off if you don't pay attention to how you load near them.

Bought these for 2004 Ford Taurus. I haven't installed the rear cover yet, mainly bought them for front seat.Cons:- Headcover fit too large so not snug fit- Mesh on seat and back stops mid-way up the back, wish it went up all the way.Pros- Very comfortable in seat area due to mesh over foam, seems to breathe well- Realtively easy install On front seats- Fits fairly well for universal fit, just a little bit loose in lumbar area of seat backWe'll see how they hold up over time and how difficult the rear seat install is. I think that will be much more difficult than the front seats.Update after Rear Install:Rear install was difficult as I expected, more difficult thanks to Ford engineers. These rear seat covers would do well for a split seat design where the seats can fold forward if needed. However in this vintage Ford the rear seats have panels that fold forward, with the outside "rim" of the seats (sides and top) bolted in. This meant once removing the seats and fitting the covers, to reinstall, the panels have to be tilted forward to bolt them in. Let's say I used some creative engineering and tweaking to be able to use these seats covers but as such, the ability to utilize the panels folding forward is not feasible with these seat covers.I am not deducting any stars from this product for this issue because there is no way a company could make a non-custom seat cover to accommodate a design like this. The seat covers look and feel great, and if you have a split seat design where the entire seat backs fold down when needed you should not have any of the issues is struggled with. One final tip for the rear seat, the directions and rear seat panels are not clear on which panel is for the seat back and which is for seat portion you sit on. make sure you fit them on without strapping them on to be sure you get them right.

I have had the cover on for about 3 months now. Have waited to see how it does in bad weather before reviewing. We have had some pretty heavy thunderstorms this summer, one storm was strong enough to snap a pine tree in half and that tree was about 30 yards from the camper and cover and the wind direction was broadside to the coach. I have not had any issues with rips or tears or anything else except it does tend to shift a little in the winds. So I will occasionally straighten it up and retighten the straps no big deal. I am holding back a star for the following reasons: 1. there are no access zippers on the drivers side. 2. the tightening buckles are fairly cheap plastic and will not last more than a few years at best. No velcro seals for the air vent holes, we have huge problems with wasps and daubers and they will enter any possible access. 3. it is really hard to get it on the coach (all though that may be the case for all covers, I don't know). On the positive side, the seams are very well sewn and the material is pretty stout. It is breathable and has enough slack to move freely to let some air circulate. It is a pretty good fit for being a generic cover, I think this would work for a 30' coach but would be tight. All in all, it seems like a good deal and well worth the price if it holds up for at least a couple of years. I recommend.

I bought this kit for my Yamaha FZ1 motorcycle. What I like the most about it is that it does not require any modification of the headlight assembly. The high beam/low beam switching is done by moving the bulb horizontally so that it moves in and out of a shield which blocks some of the light in low beam mode. The bulb is moved automatically by an electromagnet that is driven by the high/low beam switch. The HID bulb assembly is just a little bit bigger than an H4 bulb but it fits in the same place. The rubber cover over the back of the bulb does not fit perfectly, but I believe it will stay in place.Installing the ballasts was a little bit of a challenge as there is very little place under the bike's fairing, but I was able to locate both ballasts behind the instrument panel, out of the way. I secured them to the fairing holding bracket with high quality double sided tape.I had to cut (and resolder) the wiring harness which was designed for a car with 3 or 4 feet between the headlights. There was just a lot of extra wire length and it would have been even more difficult to install everything on a motorcycle without cutting the extra wiring. This is a critical operation as you do not want to do a poor job with splices otherwise you may develop electrical problems at the most inopportune time. I used shrink tubing to protect the splices. You could use electrical tape, but the shrink tubing is more durable and cleaner. It took the better part of an afternoon to do the installation. It did not have to take that long, but count on at least 2 hours if you want to do a good job. If you are not very handy with a soldering iron, I recommend getting help from a professional installer.The bulbs emit a very bright, slightly blueish pattern. Personally I would have preferred the 5000K color temperature which is pure white and penetrates better through the fog, but the 5000K was not in stock when I was ready to buy.These sets are rated 55W, therefore they draw about as much power as regular H4 bulbs. HID lights are also available with a 35W power rating, which is still much brighter than halogen but draws quite a bit less power than a regular H4 bulb. Some motorcycles have marginal alternators, so if you have one of those, the 35W kit may be preferable. I do not have this problem and I like the extremely bright output of those kits.I will revise this posting as needed if anything comes up, reliability or operation wise.September 2017 update:The headlights have been working very well (with one caveat, see below) until now.Both headlights stopped working a few days ago. The fuse was OK and I verified that the inverters were not getting power even though there was 12V power going to the relay module. I disassembled the connector to the relay module and it is badly burned (see pictures).The kit is now out of warranty but this looks like a design defect, the connector is not rated for the current drawn by the two 55W inverters.Now is time to see how good the Innovited customer service is... I will update when I find out.Caveat:When I originally installed the projectors, I noticed that while they both turned on when the ignition key was turned on, they flicker and sometimes turn off when the engine is started (because the battery voltage drops when the starter runs). When that happens, they do not restart automatically when the engine runs, ignition has to be turned off (because on motorcycles, you cannot turn off the headlights, you can only switch between low beam and high beam). But then you have to restart the engine and the same problem comes back. The battery was not new but it started the engine very well so it was not that bad. So many times I would ride with only one headlight working. I fixed the problem by adding a circuit that keeps the headlights off while starting the engine. I have had no problems with lights flickering since.

I bought an original LifeHammer years ago, after a friend nearly drowned by skidding off-road into a canal. I bought these Exlights when I handed off my LifeHammer to my teen driver. I have used the cutter blade to slice through a tangled tie-down strap on my car, so I can vouch for effectiveness of that part of this tool; I'm crossing my fingers that the glass-breaking end will be as effective in a real emergency.In the photo below, you can see my original LifeHammer next to this Exlight hammer. There are cosmetic differences, but they are very very slight. The weight of each hammer is almost exactly the same: LifeHammer was 100g, Exlight was 102g. They feel the same in hand as well. Getting 2 Exlights for less than the price I paid for my LifeHammer was a major bonus.Note: being able to break a window or cut a jammed seatbelt is important, but you need to also learn other skills to improve your odds of escaping an underwater wreck. Don't stop at just buying this tool, head to the Internet and study up on escape methods!

I ordered this bull bar after reading the reviews of this product on Amazon and the price of course. I was skeptical at first but the cheapest price made me to buy it. It was only $129.60  and $19.99 for shipping fee. Westin bull bar would cost me $252.59 and I save about $100. Even though it doesn't have the Westin logo, it works as it is designed to do. It looks sharp. I love it.I gave it 4 stars because of the delay from ecustomhitch company. Other than that, it is a nice product.

I bought these for my Ninja 300, a pair of H7 bulbs. I've been using an H11 system for my car for about 6 months without any issue. This is a great system and id recommend this to anyone. Installation is easy and is a true plug and play, just find a place to secure the ballasts and zip tie any hanging wires and your good to go.

I purchased the 1.5 ton Torin aluminum Racing Jack in anodized red from PepBoys.  The anodized aluminum looks great and the low profile was perfect for raising my Honda S2000.  For several years (at least 3yrs as far as remember) it provided decent service, raising one corner of the S2000 at a time, without any issues.  Recently I had to raise the front end of my wife's Honda Element and while raising the car from the factory center location to put jack stands on, the jack started to bleed profusely from it's belly. I tried sending an email to Torin via their website and did not receive any replies to my request to purchase a seal rebuild kit.I will be throwing away the jack as I do not trust it anymore and I do not care to wait for Torin to reply to my 2 week old email. My next jack will be more expensive but it will be stamped with "Made in USA."**01/01/13** Update: First went out and bought the Arcan XL325R 3.25 ton jack from Costco for $99! A great jack for a great price. Only downside is weight.Decided to tear open the Torin and see if I can rebuild it. Very easy to get to the piston:****Before I began, I wore proper eye protection***1. Removed vent screw and drained all hydraulic fluid.2. Removed the 4 allen head bolts holding the reservoir on each side to allow better acccess to the plunger later on.3. Turned the jack over and removed the bolt that has two flat sides (reduced tension on boltby pulling spring towards the bolt). Then removed spring.4. Removed the eye bolt by turning the eye (do not adjust it's nut). This will separate the plunger from the rod it connects to.5. Used a flat head screw driver and a light hammer to loosen the large cylinder nut using the two notches on the nut.6. Pulled piston out and discovered why jack failed (see picture)Took the shredded O-rings to OSH and found the perfect match (Danco #18 O-ring 1 3/16" O.D.x15/16" I.D.x1/8"). Part number is #96735. Pack of 10 O-rings was $2.49. Put the new O-rings on the piston and jack works again.

This is the same piece as on the GT 350. I figured if it's good enough for the GT 350 why not for my 2017 Mustang GT Premium. Took about a week to get through the mail. Free delivery. The piece had a few minor scratches it's not really wrapped all that well. The installation took about 90 minutes. The instructions say to disconnect the battery. The positive cable is really in the way. I didn't want to loose the computer I've read that the new Mustang runs funny until the computer re-learns and you loose all of your presets My-Key radio and cell phone etc... Any who, I hooked up the positive and negative battery cables to a trickle charger before disconnecting only the positive cable. I wadded up a towel and set it on that out of the way. BTW worked great didn't loose a thing. Also the instructions say to take off the windshield wipers. I didn't remove the wipers and the K-Brace slid into place without a problem. Just lift the cowl an inch or so and you can slip the bolts in and out. Be careful and take your time. If you drop one of those bolts or clips you may never find them again. You will need a 15 MM deep those studs are long. Don't over tighten the bolts.

The mounting clips on the bottom were a little small so they weren't holding it in so it wasn't to much of an issue I bent the clips out just a bit and they snapped in snuggly! Looks great on my truck and i would recommend it to anyone!

This lift was easy to install, it took me about 2.5 hours only because it was my first time using coil spring compressors. It gives the jeep a nice, more aggressive stance. The jeep drives exactly the same as stock. We are now running 265/70/r17 which is 31.6 x 10.43. They rub a tiny bit on the front fender inserts which are easily removed. Overall I love it and gave me exactly what I wanted at a super cheap price! In the picture the bottom is before the top is after.Update: the back tires rub on the rear shocksa little just because the tire are so big. Spacers are coming soon

This was waaaaay more of a job than my son and I could handle.We watched YouTube videos, broke out the blow dryers, and did our best to heat, stretch and pull this stuff in to place. Think we will try again in the middle of summer's heat, when the sun will help us too.However - let's get back to the product. This vinyl wrap is TOUGH. The carbon fiber pattern is fantastic. The grid on the back made it easy to cut... in our case, the material totally out classed our skills.  We are going to keep trying, but are taking a break at this point in time.What did we think that we could do as our first job? 1998 Jeep Wrangler TJ fender flares, of course.  What a goofy thing to start out with; no straight lines, curves and bends everywhere, and they are plastic, not metal.My son suggests that we start simple once we re-kickstart our effort... and he suggests that we start with the gas cap of our daughter's Chevy Cobalt first. Yeah, that's the ticket. Next time we will start small and work our way up the challenge ladder.Attached pic shows the travesty of our broken effort. Just could not get that big bendy corner to work. Not giving up yet though.I'll Be BaaackThe product truly is top quality.RecommendedGo for itWe received this item gratis from the manufacturer or a seller, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing review reflect that testing experience.

My first time ever using this stuff and let me tell u.It's not hard to do. Watch a YouTube video for like 40 secs.Clean surface with soap and water. Rinse and dryLay over area before pulling off sheet.Make a cut around area to remove extra try to leave about a extra 3 inches all the way around.On bends use a heat gun use it like a spray paint can 6-8 inches semi fast sweep to slow will weaken the wrap.DONT BE AFRAID TO PULL ON THE WRAP!It's pretty strong. If you get air bubbles or crease just take a breather and pull it up and re do it.Try using more pressure pulling the wrap.That should fix your problemsGood luck :)

The old incandescent bulbs have about a 3x brightness difference because they use a different filament for the brake and running lights. These bulbs use all the LEDs in the array for both settings, and the difference is not much. Maybe half again as bright. The low level is definitely brighter than the incandescent bulb which is great, but I think the bright setting is not as bright as the old incandescent bulbs. The issue here is that you want the people behind you to see that you hit your brakes, and if the difference is subtle you run the risk of not having someone notice your brake lights.One small issue is that these put out a very white light, but the red tail light housings were made for incandescent bulbs which are yellow/red. Because of this, the brake lights look a bit orange instead of red. In the video I have the car as it would be at night, with the tail lights on, and then I tap the brakes a few times. You can see the large difference in brightness of the original bulbs compared with the small change with the LED on the left side of the car. I'm not sure which order the pictures will be in, but I have a 3rd LED brake light so you can tell which is the one with the brakes on. The LED bulb in on the left side. You can see with the brakes applied the LED is not as bright, and with the tail lights on the LED is brighter.I would not recommend these as brake lights because there is not enough difference between the levels. For brake lights I would recommend red LED bulbs to replace your incandescent bulbs. If you are using this for something else, they are sturdy and I have no problems with them.

Option One)RelayPop old Flasher Relay off and replace with this.OrOption two)Resistors Open the package of resistors and figure how to install, remove light fixtures, trace  wire that goes to the blinker, splice into wire, Protect new connections as to prevent any shorts, find a safe location to mount the crazy hot resistors, put everything back together, and finally hope everything is good to go.In less than a minute I found my Flasher Relay.  Turn on your turn signals so you can hear and feel it clicking when you reach under.On 2005 F150 the relay is located below the steering wheel right above Brake pedal. No disassembly required.I replaced all my lights with LEDs, although I liked the "Hyper Flash" I didn't like getting attention from the cops( twice ) thinking I have a burnt out bulb.

The back of one of my favorite bags was stained with dye from my clothes.  This product removed all but the dye that had settled into the deeper crevices of the leather, although I believe even those would come up with a bit more product and just a touch of elbow grease.The first picture shows half of the area cleaned and half left stained.  You can see where I accidentally spilled a drop of this formula near the top of the dirty area and simply wiped away with a paper towel.  The second picture shows the entire area cleaned and the pad showing how much dirt/dye came up.I did try cleaning the bag with plain water as well to make sure this product isn't just fancy overpriced water with some additives and the water did remove some of the surface dye but deeper stains remained.  The cleaner removed the vast majority of what was left over.The leather does feel a bit dry after cleaning which I'm slightly concerned about as I don't want it to dry out and crack bit I'm counting on the oils from my hands/skin to replace any oils that were removed.

This tool makes removing orifice tubes easy, and virtually eliminates the risk of the tube breaking inside the AC line. This kit is the same as OTC and a few other I believe. I have used the OTC set in the past. It is identical to this one, except for it came with instructions. The tool is easy enough to figure out, but when you only use it once or twice a year, a refresher course would be nice. So yes this set works just fine to safely remove orifice tubes. But if the OTC kit is about the same price, I would choose that one, as you might get  the instruction book.

I used these LED's, as well as the same company's T5 LED's to replace, and change to red, all my gauge cluster as well as my AC/heater control cluster bulbs in my 2003 Toyota Tundra.  I have been happy with the results as the LED's and included wedge bases fit well and illuminate the clusters very uniformly. Also, my gauge dimmer knob also functions just fine with these.  Time will ultimately tell, but so far, they look great, and it's easy enough to replace them if any should fail.

We recently bought a boat and we found that the boat would roll a little on its own so we wanted to get a tongue dock for it. We bought one of those small, round, donut-looking tongue docks. It did not work, the boat was so heavy that it smashes that small plastic donut.The Lynx Chock r Dock looked like it would work for our situation. We have not been disappointed with the construction or performance. It is a very hard, solid plastic wedge that can be used for either a wheel chock or as a tongue dock.It is constructed as a wedge to use as a traditional chock but it has a well made in it so that a trailer tongue can set down in it. It is such a hard plastic that it works perfectly.Lynx also has other chocks and levelers that can be used as well. The levelers are made to interlock with the chock.

Great kit it works excellent on my 2012 ram 3500 crew cab 4x4! It took me 15 mins from start to finish if that. The kit came with the torx 45 needed to remove the bolt that holds the tailgate cable. Which is great!Only turn the blind nut 8 turns or it will get ruined! Mark it with a sharpie!Make sure you clip the little plastic cable clip/protector piece included in this kit otherwise your tailgate will chew it up!And most important remove the lock washer and limiter that lock your tailgate cable on the bottom so it can move freely. Look at my pictures.Thread lock is included make sure you use it!

I used these for custom headlight setup where heat was a big concern, these LEDs run so cool even the heat sink is barely warm to the touch.Produces a very good light output considering these are only 20 watt each compared to standard 55-80w bulbs. These are installed in a projector housing.

Just got this top in the mail, quick shipping, and started getting it installed.  The instructions are ok at best but my suggestion is to watch a few YouTube videos which are way better!  At first the top will fit REALLY tight but with heat it will relax.  I had 85 and sun and it was still tight.  To get that extra bit of help, I ran Jeep with heater on high to roast it and that made all the difference.  Have patience, some beer and before you know it you will have one hell of an awesome top!

I decided to try these out, and I'm glad I did! The black ones look really god in combination with the carbon fiber license plate frame I also got from Amazon -&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/REAL-100-CARBON-FIBER-LICENSE-PLATE-FRAME-TAG-COVER-FF/dp/B0070Y36N2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">REAL 100% CARBON FIBER LICENSE PLATE FRAME TAG COVER FF</a>&nbsp;Since most plates only use two screws, one set covers front and rear (If you are lucky enough to live where a front plate is required)The white ring mounts like a washer under your mounting screws, and the black cap just snaps over the top. Seems to hold well enough to not fall off, but they pull of easily if you have to get to your screws. Another reviewer mentioned that they trap water in and rusted his mounting hardware. That is good to know. I would suggest going with stainless steel mounting hardware just in case. (Which isn't a bad idea anyway)

The perfect tips for dressing up a single or dual exhaust system -- Highly-polished stainless steel looks sharp -- and the rolled edge gives a modern look to the finished installation. NOTE: The LARGEST pipe diameter that this tip will fit is: TWO (2) inches -- OUTSIDE DIAMETER, with mounting brackets removed and mounting screws tightened against the outside of the pipe. For the 2-inch O.D. pipes, I removed all of the mounting hardware and welded the tips in place. The stainless-steel tips fit perfectly, with no rattles Slant-Cut tips have a small hole in the bottom side to allow for drainage. Some have complained about the label being too hard to remove. That nasty label comes off easily if soaked in kerosene for 30 minutes. A good coat of Silicone Car Wax will keep those tips looking good in the winter, when the roads are salted.

This Kit fits my new 15' Mazda 6 GT perfectly!The lugs and wheel locks are solid!I only gave it 4 stars though because the key for the spline drive lug nuts could (SHOULD) be a LOT stronger then it is.I have read many reviews about the Key breaking for or splitting even though the lugs were torqued to specs.So I ended up buying a spare here from Amazon and will go to a local weld shop here soon and see if they can somehow modify it and reinforce it to keep it from possibly splitting.I couldn't imagine that happening while on the side of the roadthat would definitely suck!

They were a pain in the butt to replace on my motorcycle. However I'm very impressed with the output and color of the bulbs. They look like HID lights. I'm a little worried about their life span with the reviews I've read on Amazon but keeping my fingers crossed they will last for a couple of years. Sylvania will replace them if they fail in less than a year. Overall happy with my purchase.

this was really easy to install on my 2011 gmc acadia. my only recommendation is that you have a tap set on hand. if your car is like mine the nuts that are already on the car will have some rust on them. because of this rust I could not get the bolts (that come with the hitch) to go in all the way. I finally went and got the correct tap set from my dad ran that threw it real quick and within 5 min had all the bolts in and good to go! before running the tap threw it and clearing the rust out I spent like an hour or more trying to get the bolts to go it. so just run the tap threw it and same some headache. also dropping the rear exhaust was a lot easier than I thought it would have been. I was a little hesitant to drop the rear exhaust but there was only 2 rubber mounts per exhaust end (I only thought there was 1, took me a while to realize there was 2) once I dropped the 2 mounts per exhaust end and the one just farther up it was really easy to install the hitch. I read some reviews that some people were able to install it without dropping the hitch, I could not because the exhaust end was too close to the holes I needed for the install. so just take the couple min and drop it (for it doesn't take that long to drop it.) over all it really isn't that hard of an install. one suggestion is go to youtube.com and watch a video on how to install it. saves ya some time and helps ya see what to do.  then for the wire harness I got one that just snaps into the existing wire harness. just a plug and play really easy. no cutting wires or splicing. heres the title of the wire harness I used on my 2011 Acadia.Tow Ready 118451 T-One Connector Assembly for GMC Acadia again I suggest you look on youtube just to see how the wire harness is installed before attempting it. hopes this review helps :)

Bottom picture before, top after. 2012 Silverado here - lift looks good, front sits 3/4in higher, will get 2in blocks for the back. If you don't want to block the back go with the 2" kit. A crow bar and ball joint separator definitely help getting the ball joints back in. Regreased all the boots and immediately got an alignment. 4 stars because the strut bolts need to be bigger to refit the harness clips! will tape down later. YouTube videos helped a lot. Took me about 6 hours being a novice and taking my time. Ball joints will be the most difficult getting back in, use a crow bar to put enough pressure down on them so they don't soon.

Purchased this to apply to my Mickey Thompson rims. The rims had originally been dipped black but I didn't like the matte black rim with the black truck. Decided to use this to try and get a bronze effect on them. And it turned out awesome! I also do my front bow tie with it. In total I have 5 coats of black and 4 coats of this on each rim. One can was more than enough for my 16's. Only issue is that it fades rather quick. Tire shine brings the color out again but I would advise to use a plastidip clear coat over this to prevent fade. Overall awesome product.

Leaves a great finish! I usually apply this every couple months and use Meguairs spray wax for maintenance washes. This looks AMAZING on dark colored vehicles. A little bit goes a long way! Dont wipe it off until you can take your finger and rub it off your car without it smearing. That will give you the best results. Can be applied by hand, but im lazy and I use my DA buffer with a red pad on a slow speed.

I just installed these as backup lights on my 2013 JK and wow what a difference. They fit great, but check for operation before reinstalling light assembly since they are polarized. (If it doesn't light up, pull the product out and turn it 180 degrees.) Each light took less than 5 minutes. I have some pictures, but they do not do the product full justice since the camera down-plays the actual brightness. Two pictures have just the left light upgrade for comparison. The "bulb" has 16 ultra-bright LEDs mounted for its superior lighting - 4 on the end with a dispersion lens and 12 on the sides. This product operates cooler (as in emitted temperature) when active, than the OEM bulb (a benefit of LED technology) and should last much longer as well, assuming high quality parts and manufacturing techniques.

Look good and appear to be solid. Not sure why APS cant start just adding 6 normal brackets instead of the funky bracket for the passenger front. I literally spent 1 hour to get that one bracket installed and the other five took maybe 30 mins. No reason to have this bracket other than saving money and lazy to change it to 6x normal brackets. Big PIA To install the passenger front even after watching videos.

The iTavah digital tire pressure gauge is what my garage and air compressor have been missing.  I ran across a situation where I purchased a new sports car and the dealership extremely overinflated my tires and I used my old school method of putting air into the tire and checking with a separate (cheap) gauge.  After about an hour of going back and forth, I immediately looked for a digital tire pressure gauge.  After using this product several times throughout the week to get my tires to the perfect PSI setting, I must say this tool is amazing and I highly recommend it and overall this product gets 5 stars and heres why.PRODUCT PACKAGING// iTavah uses a simple packaging with all the information listed about the product on the outside of the box. Included is everything you need to get up and running, including batteries for the digital screen.  My only advise is to use some teflon tape when screwing in the rubber hose and quick connect plug (note its not required, but to me it makes a better seal).DESIGN/FUNCTIONALITY// The digital tire gauge feels really solid in the hand and is made of high-strength materials; no cheap parts are being used.  You can instantly tell the one-piece closure design is made of metal and just fits perfectly in the hand.  The straight lock-on air chuck is made of alloy and is what iTavah describes as a thickening design that is both durable and convenient to use and I 100% agree with this statement, as I didn't run into any issues during usage.  The LCD (blue) backlit digital screen is bright and very easy to read.  You can cycle through four kind of measurements and they include PSI, Bar, Kg/cm2, and kpa.  So no matter what you need this gauge should work.  One of my favorite functions of this digital tire gauge is the pressure relief button on the front of the product to release air in a tire thats overinflated.  Such a great idea and Im sure all of us will use it eventually.  Everything about the iTavah digital tire pressure gauge screams quality and as mentioned I haven't ran into any issues or have any concerns regarding the longevity of this product.  If I experience any issues, Id edit my review.FINAL IMPRESSIONS// Overall, Im extremely impressed with this iTavah product and it definitely lives next to my air compressor and Im confident the PSI reading is correct and the gauge will last a long time.  Id can say without a doubt that I recommend this product and you should put it on your wish list, as I know you won't be disappointed! Ratinga perfect 5/5 stars!!!Note, I did receive this product on behalf of iTavah for an honest consumer experience and everything in my review is my honest opinion and usage of this product since Ive received it.

Flat steel strip from Lowe's  (one with holes pre punched) a lot of the wraps to super secure the horns. Hoses cut to 13 inches. I replaced the included in-line glass bussman fuse with a bladed fuse holder and extended that wire so it would be easily accessible if/when it blows. All in all, I probably spend an additional $20 bucks on Misc additional pieces. Most of which any nominal handy man would just have laying around his workbench.  Also numbered and labeled the horns and Air compressor outlets. Trust me, if those colored bands come off, you'll wish you'd taken 60 seconds to mark your parts and ports.  Perfect sound and tempo. I've heard some that seemed too fast. Just awesome!  ...even if my Girl Friend shakes her head every time I use it :) There is no reason this product won't fit any vehicle ( car, truck, boat, atv, what ever) as long as you have a 12v power supply and a suitable mounting location. Remember that exposure to weather will reduce your life expectancy, the hoses need to be the SAME length and not TOO long. (I had about 1.5" left when I cut mine to 13")

This is ugly but works in stopping further damage by essentially "glueing" the torn area with a similar color. Matching the color is not the easiest thing. If you are lucky and the offered plain colors match your furniture without any mixing, then you are in luck and may end up with a better result. Otherwise, this is a crap shoot. However, on the positive note, this is made in USA and has no strange odors during use.
